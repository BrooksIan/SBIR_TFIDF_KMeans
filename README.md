**Author**: Ian Brooks

**Follow** [LinkedIn - Ian Brooks PhD] (https://www.linkedin.com/in/ianrbrooksphd/)

**Source Data** [SBIR Search Site](https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/award/all)

**Addtional Information**: The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program is a highly competitive program that encourages domestic small businesses to engage in Federal Research/Research and Development (R/R&D) that has the potential for commercialization. Through a competitive awards-based program, SBIR enables small businesses to explore their technological potential and provides the incentive to profit from its commercialization. By including qualified small businesses in the nation's R&D arena, high-tech innovation is stimulated and the United States gains entrepreneurial spirit as it meets its specific research and development needs.

**IDF / TF Overview:**
![TF](https://github.com/BrooksIan/SBIR_TFIDF_KMeans/blob/master/TFIDF.jpg "tf")

1. Import Data - Use the provided Jypter Notebook

2. Prepare Text for Models - Tokeniziation
