Research has marked a decline in math achievement around the time students take algebra in middle school. Technological innovations that produce immediate information teachers and students can use to facilitate dialogue and analysis of complex topics offer potential for improving understanding and learning.\nProject Activities: During Phase I in 2017, the team developed a prototype of a dashboard that generates information on student work during algebra class. At the end of Phase I, researchers completed a pilot study with 254 students and nine teachers across grade 8 and 9 classrooms. They found that the prototype operated as intended, teachers were able to understand and use results, and students were engaged during classroom dialogue around the insights on their work. In Phase II, the team will fully develop the user interface for students and teachers, a tool to create and share Open Educational Resources (OERs), and materials to support classroom implementation. After development is complete, the researchers will carry out a pilot study to examine the usability and feasibility, fidelity of implementation, and the promise of the dashboard to inform teacher instruction and improve student learning. Participants in the study will include 20 Algebra I mathematics classrooms in 10 schools, and the students enrolled in those classrooms, with one classroom per school randomly assigned to use Woot Math as well as the dashboard and the other half assigned to a business-as-usual control. Researchers will compare student scores on pre and post algebra learning outcomes aligned to Common Core standards.\nProduct: In prior research and development, the project team developed Woot Math, a technology delivered intervention with interactive games and activities for algebra learning. In this project, the team will develop Woot Math Polls, a formative assessment dashboard to convert student work into data-driven insights to promote dialogue and discussion of complex algebra topics between teachers and students. The dashboard will work across all web-enabled devices, including laptops, tablets, smartphones, smart boards, and projectors. The dashboard will include a teacher tool to create, customize, share, and remix materials as OERs, which teachers will share with other teachers using the dashboard. The intervention in coordination with the dashboard will support student outcomes for Common Core standards in algebra.\nPurpose: In prior research and development, the project team developed Storyworld, a web-based activity with mini-games to support English Learners (EL) in language acquisition. In this project, the team will fully develop and test a formative assessment dashboard that provides teachers with insights into EL student&apos;s progress as they use Storyworld. ELs are the fastest-growing student population in U.S. schools, with reports showing that nearly 1 in 10 public school students are ELs and approximately three in four U.S. classrooms include at least one EL. Many teachers remain unprepared for the challenge of helping ELs master both the English language and academic content.\nProject Activities: With Phase I funding in 2017, the team developed a Storyworld prototype that presented teachers with a dashboard that displayed results from a reading comprehension activity completed by 30 EL students in grade 1 and 2. At the end of Phase I, researchers completed a pilot study with three teachers. They found that the prototype operated as intended, and that teachers were able to review reports and use the findings to guide face-to-face instruction with students. In Phase II, the team will fully develop the user interfaces beyond reading data, to include listening, speaking, and writing data, and materials to support teacher use of data to guide instruction. After development is complete, the team will carry out a pilot study to examine the usability and feasibility, fidelity of implementation, and the promise of the dashboard to inform teacher insights and guide instruction, and improve EL student&apos;s language proficiency. Thirty-six Kindergarten to grade 2 classes with 10 students per class will participate in the pilot study. Half of the classes will be randomly assigned to use Storyworld and the dashboard and the other half assigned to a business-as-usual control. The researchers will compare student pre to post learning using a standardized measure of English language acquisition, the Language Assessment Scales.\nProduct: The research team will develop a formative assessment dashboard to present data to teachers on ELs performance after using Storyworld, a web-based product with mini-games to supports language acquisition through activities done simultaneously in the student&apos;s native language (e.g., Spanish and Mandarin) and in the target language (e.g., English). Reports will inform teachers of K-2 ELs&apos; progress in across reading, listening, speaking, and writing, and provide recommendations for supporting instruction. The dashboard will present results in the student&apos;s native language and in the English, show individual trajectories, and provide class-wide growth patterns.\nPurpose: This project team will fully develop and test Fate and Fortune, an online class-wide intervention where grade 8 students learn algebra within a story-based game. Research demonstrates that students who do not succeed in algebra are more likely to eventually drop out of high school. When students begin Algebra I, a lack of conceptually meaning and understanding can be further reinforced by curricula where math problems do not make sense in the context of their lives and interests.\nProject Activities: During Phase I in 2017, the team developed a prototype including the core game mechanics for students to engage in the adventure backstory and initial problem sets. At the end of Phase I, researchers completed a pilot study with 35 students and three teachers in three grade 8 classrooms. They found that the prototype operated as intended, students were engaged, reported that the activities were fun, made them curious to learn more, and helped to connect math to their lives. In Phase II, the team will develop a fully-functional user interface, interactivity across student users, narrative scripts and accompanying art assets, problem sets, and student and teacher dashboards and databases. After development is complete, the research team will carry out a pilot study to examine the usability and feasibility, fidelity of implementation, and the promise of the game to improve learning. Eight grade 8 mathematics classrooms in four schools will participate in the study, with one classroom per school randomly assigned to use the game and the other half assigned to a business-as-usual control. The team will compare student scores on pre and post Algebra I learning outcomes aligned to Common Core standards.\nProduct: Fate and Fortune is a multi-player game-based intervention for grade 8 mathematics classrooms. The game is designed for use at the beginning of Algebra I, to address core concepts that provide a foundation for student success throughout the remainder of the course. Set in the Spice Trade of the 1600s, in Fate and Fortune students design ships while managing their own Renaissance-era shipping company where they travel around the world to purchase and sell spices. Rather than focusing solely on number calculations, the game employs a story-based narrative where mathematical thinking occurs naturally as students create, build, and solve problems to support understanding of algebraic logic and structure. As a multi-player game, students will interact with other classmates to complete trades that lead to encounters with different math problems. The game design architecture will work desktops and tablets and will include supplemental print materials. A dashboard will provide teachers immediate feedback on student progress to guide responses to individual learners and the collective classroom.\nPurpose: The project team will fully develop and test CloudLab, a web-based dashboard to present scientific data captured by sensors during experiments. The Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) emphasize the actual doing of STEM so that students can apply learning to the real world. However, students often have difficulty collecting, measuring, and applying data from inquiry activities to furthering their ideas, skills, and knowledge of STEM.\nProject Activities: During Phase I in 2017, the team developed a prototype dashboard that presents data from experiments where sensors measured the scientific properties of altitude, speed, and temperature. Researchers worked with three middle school science teachers and 350 students to determine that the prototype operated as intended. Teachers reported that students engaged in productive scientific conversations as they worked on their lab reports using the prototype. Most students reported that they would be interested in completing more science investigations using this method. In Phase II of the project, the team will fully develop the back-end data system to present results, a portal to provide access to user generated, lessons, lab templates, and coding activities across participating classrooms. After development concludes, researchers will conduct a pilot study to assess the feasibility and usability, fidelity of implementation, and the promise of CloudLab for improving student learning. The team will collect data from 30 middle school teachers and students in these classes, with half of the classes randomly assigned to use the CloudLab and the other half to use business as usual laboratory activities to teach the same course content. Researchers will compare pre-and-post scores of student&apos;s learning NGSS outcomes associated to the experiments, as well as scores on student motivation to conduct scientific experiments.\nProduct: CloudLab will be a web-based dashboard that presents data captured by sensors on scientific properties such as altitude, speed, and temperature. CloudLab will work with the existing PocketLab sensor, a small wireless device that transmits scientific data using Bluetooth to a smartphone, tablet, or computer. CloudLab will consist of a portal for middle school science students, so that they can record and store data from their individual experiments, analyze, and present findings to classmates and as course assignments. CloudLab will include a portal for teachers to manage lab groups, to aggregate results at the class and individual student level, and to share or find content on lessons, lab templates, and coding activities. CloudLab will be used by students in and out of classrooms to supplement learning of course content aligned to NGSS topics in physics, chemistry, biology, Earth science, engineering, design, and technology.\nPurpose: In previous research and development, the team created LiveSchool, a technology for teachers to report student behavior in their class. In this project, the team will fully develop and test ClassCoach, a dashboard for administrators to track student behavior and to recommend resources teachers can use to address student behavioral needs in their classes. Over the past several years, schools have increased focus on identifying students who exhibit behavior challenges and in providing personnel tools to more effectively and efficiently meet student behavioral needs.\nProject Activities: During Phase I in 2017, the project team developed a prototype of ClassCoach, including a user interface, an information management system for housing and organizing data, and the reporting engine for generating reports The team completed a pilot study with 89 administrators, and they found that 97% of the administrators reported that the prototype functioned as intended and was easy to use to track student behaviors. More than 50% used the dashboard to identify teachers who needed additional guidance in providing students behavioral supports. In Phase II, the team will fully develop the dashboard&apos;s architecture to host diverse sources of data, a filter to sort and analyze data by relevant school characteristics and needs, and a portal with recommendations teachers can use to support improvements in students&apos; behavior. After development is complete, the research team will conduct a pilot study to assess the feasibility and usability, fidelity of implementation, and the promise of the dashboard for supporting administrators in tracking student behavior and providing resources teachers can use to meet the behavioral needs of students. Participants in the pilot study will include administrators from 100 schools, half of whom will use the platform and half will use LiveSchool without the new component. Researchers will investigate whether the dashboard increases the ability of administrators to track student behavior, and provide teachers resources to manage and improve student behavior relative to the comparison condition.\nProduct: ClassCoach is a dashboard to provide school administrators reports on student behavior and to recommend resources for teachers to more effectively and efficiently meet students&apos; behavioral needs. The intended users are principals and guidance counselors. ClassCoach will include reports with data-driven information for administrators to determine students who need more intensive behavior interventions, and to identify classroom teachers who need additional resources to improve student behaviors. The dashboard will also provide videos with step-by-step coaching and modeling of best practices for teachers to support and improve student behavior in classrooms.\nPurpose: This project team will fully develop and test Mission US TimeSnap, a game integrated within a Virtual Reality (VR) headset. This VR environment will provide an immersive exploration and analysis of events in U.S. history. In the most recent National Assessment of Educational Progress, only 17% of grade 8 students performed at or above the proficient level in U.S. history. The discipline of history goes beyond knowing what happened in the past; students must investigate why significant events occurred and form interpretations based on skilled readings of historical sources, and Mission US TimeSnap will provide students the opportunity to develop both investigative and interpretative skills.\nProject Activities: During Phase I in 2017, the team developed a prototype of TimeSnap, including a VR environment where students immerse themselves in content related to the history of the Revolutionary War. At the end of Phase I, researchers completed a pilot study with 58 students in grades 9 and 11 and two teachers. They found that the hardware VR and software-based prototype operated as intended, teachers were able to integrate it within the classroom environment, and students were engaged while using the prototype. In Phase II, the team will add content modules and a gameplay narrative to the platform, build the dashboards to present results, strengthen the back-end management system, create the professional development materials, and build out the classroom activities to accompany the VR experience. After development is complete, the research team will conduct a pilot study to assess the feasibility and usability, fidelity of implementation, and the promise of the TimeSnap for improving student learning in history. Ten high school history classrooms will participate in the pilot study, with half randomly assigned to use TimeSnap and half to follow business-as-usual instructional practices. Researchers will compare students&apos; pre-and-post scores on learning historical facts, and their ability to investigate and analyze historical events using research developed measures.\nProduct: This project team will develop TimeSnap, a game-based virtual reality (VR) game designed to immerse high school students in U.S. history. In the game, students travel back in time to investigate and explore historical locations, encounter people from the past, analyze artifacts, and bring back evidence to support interpretations of what happened. Each VR experience lasts about 15 minutes and is preceded and followed by classroom discussions and activities. The components of the intervention will include: a VR headset with content from the Revolutionary War in colonial Boston, the years leading up to the Civil War, the period of Western expansion, and 1900s New York; a classroom guide with briefs that provide teachers with full instruction and materials for classroom implementation; and teacher and student dashboards to track progress and a website with professional development videos. TimeSnap intends to increase students&apos; knowledge of U.S. history, their interest and enthusiasm for studying history, and their historical thinking skills.\n \nIn this project, researchers will develop a prototype of a web-based tool through which English Learners (EL) can practice conversation with an automated avatar. The Speaking and Listening Learning System will provide support, feedback, and will adapt to the conversational level of students. At the end of Phase I, in a pilot study with 20 EL students in grades 1 and 2, the researchers will examine whether the prototype functions as planned, if students are able to converse with the avatar, and if the prototype shows initial promise for improving outcomes for language acquisition.\n \nPhotodynamic Therapy  PDT  is a promising modality for cancer treatment  Oxygen molecules in the\nmetastable singlet delta state O      are believed to be the species that destroys cancerous cells during\nPDT  Despite the benefit of targeted PDT that kills tumors selectively with minimum effect on surrounding\nhealthy tissues  at the present time it is difficult  if not impossible  to predict the response of an individual to\nPDT  This has inhibited the acceptance of PDT for clinical uses  Under NCI SBIR funding  Physical\nSciences Inc   PSI  has developed two prototype  in vivo capable dosimeters for PDT  a non imaging ultra \nsensitive photomultiplier tube  PMT  based point sensor for singlet O  detection and a  D imaging sensor\nfor PS fluorescence and singlet O  detections  These devices use spectral and temporal discrimination\nmethods to optimize sensitivity  The overall goal of our proposed program is to produce an integrated \nimaging PDT system that will use real time feedback to control PDT light dose during the treatment \nIn Phase I  we will develop and test a newly introduced  D imaging camera that incorporates gating below\na microsecond and a fast framing rate  This will enhance the sensitivity singlet oxygen by at least an order\nof magnitude  The system will be based upon PSIandapos s current system platform of the  D imaging system that\nhas demonstrated the ability to observe singlet O  and PS fluorescence in vivo produced during PDT  The\ncurrent system uses a near infrared  NIR  sensitive camera for singlet O  images  However  this camera\ndoes not have a fast time gating capability  and that limits the detection method to only spectral\ndiscrimination  The system will be developed and tested on in vitro samples at PSI then transported to\nDartmouth College for in vivo testing  The Phase I study result will be utilized to design a Phase II system\nfor both PDT treatments and dosimeters  A fiber coupled pulsed diode laser will be used for the PDT\nexcitation source  The goal of the Phase I study is to demonstrate the detection sensitivity of the newly\nintroduced  D camera integrated in the PSI detection system  In Phase II the combined PDT system will\nbe designed  built  and tested for extensive performance verification for in vitro and in vivo studies  An\naccurate dosimeter to optimize the individual treatment response of PDT is necessary to improve the\noutcomes of PDT in a clinical environment  A fully developed instrument will be a valuable tool first for PDT\nresearchers and subsequently for clinical PDT uses The proposed research has the potential to significantly improve clinical PDT applications by concurrently\noperating PDT treatment and dosimeter as a combined system  Eventually  it could lead to much higher\nefficacy in PDT treatments in the clinic by enabling physicians to intelligently adapt individual light doses for\nPDT to match the different responses of individual patients\nNo other group of diseases encompasses a greater pathophysiology than do the rheumatic diseases \nSpanning multiple organ systems  clinical decisions often rely on coordinated efforts from primary care\nproviders and rheumatologists to rule in or rule out differential diagnoses when treating inflammatory conditions\nsuch as rheumatoid arthritis  RA  and systemic lupus erythematosus  SLE   RA is a symmetric  inflammatory \nperipheral polyarthritis leading to deformity of joints via erosion of bone and surrounding cartilage  SLE can\naffect virtually any organ leading to fatigue  fever  myalgia  weight change and complications associated with\nrenal  central nervous system  and hematologic systems can be life threatening  RA and SLE are diagnosed\nthrough clinical judgment after excluding alternative diagnoses  In the case of both diseases  individual\nlaboratory tests are effective only in a portion of the disease population  In RA  testing for rheumatoid factor\nand anti CCP antibodies provide very important information when positive  However  these two analytes\nremain negative in      of patients and continue to be negative throughout diagnostic follow up in     of\npatients with RA  Further  erythrocyte sedimentation rates  ESR  and c reactive protein  CRP  levels are\ngenerally strongly correlated with radiographic findings of joint damage  These measurements  however  can\nbe elevated by other infectious and inflammatory processes that are not specific for RA or can be altered  in\nthe case of ESR  by acute phase reactants from malignancy  tissue injury  or trauma  In SLE  exclusion of\nmarkers diagnostic for RA coupled with presence of markers measuring antinuclear antibodies  ANA  and\nfollowed by assays measuring double stranded DNA  dsDNA   anti Sm  anti Ro SSA  anti La SSB  anti U \nRNP  or antiribosomal P are frequently used  Across these analyses  the sensitivity and specificity for these\nlaboratory measurements vary greatly and many have high specificity to rule in SLE but lack sensitivity as\nthese diagnostic markers can be found in other disorders  For instance  anti Ro anti La are found in Sjogrenandapos s\nsyndrome and anti U  RNP is frequently associated with mixed connective tissue disease  As a physician\ncolleague pointed out   it is difficult to diagnose a negative   Thus  diagnostic approaches for both RA and SLE\noften rely on multiple  independent laboratory tests combined with clinical observation  Distinguishing between\nthese diseases is important  as the treatment procedures for these diseases are different  Time is a frequent\nfactor in the diagnosis of these diseases and tools are needed to facilitate earlier diagnosis as treatment for\nautoimmune diseases are highly effective and early initiation of therapy leads to the best outcomes \nMisdiagnosis of these conditions is also not uncommon \n Another common disease seen by rheumatologists is fibromyalgia syndrome  FMS   FMS is a common\ncause of widespread musculoskeletal pain that affects tendons  ligaments  and muscle  FMS is difficult to\ndiagnose and treat and a critical clinical point is that FMS is not explained by another rheumatic or systemic\ndisorder  Thus  FMS is a diagnosis of exclusion once other etiologies have been considered and excluded  RA\nand SLE are two diseases that must be eliminated from the differential diagnosis  Given the complicated\ndiagnostic process these patients are often forced to endure  recent studies have also suggested that\nhealthcare dollars are saved post diagnosis and patient outcomes improve  To date  there is no laboratory test\nthat can determine presence or absence of these three conditions from a single blood sample \n The question of whether or not disease classifiers capable of providing clinically useful information could be\nbuilt based upon disease specific expression levels of mRNAs in whole blood has been a subject of research\nfor greater than ten years  Many disease specific gene expression signatures have been identified in the\nresearch lab  A few of these have even progressed into commercially viable diagnostic tests  notably for\nsystemic sclerosis \n Long non coding RNAs  lncRNA  are recently discovered regulatory RNA molecules that do not code for\nproteins but influence a vast array of biological processes  In vertebrates  the number of lncRNA genes greatly\nexceeds the number of protein coding genes  It is also thought that lncRNAs drive greater biologic complexity\nbetween vertebrates and invertebrates  These lncRNAs also show much greater cell type specific expression\npatterns than mRNAs  Humans also develop many more complex diseases than other organisms  As such \nour data presented in preliminary studies  support the notion that disease associated lncRNAs exhibit far\ngreater differences in expression than disease associated mRNAs  In this application  we propose to explore\nthe hypothesis that lncRNAs are better biomarkers of human disease than mRNAs  Here  we will focus on\nFMS and rheumatic diseases as disease categories and have identified FMS and rheumatic disease \nassociated differentially expressed lncRNAs  Study of lncRNAs in human autoimmune disease is in its infancy\nand exploration of lncRNAs as biomarkers of autoimmune disease has not been previously addressed  We\npropose the following specific aim  To identify annotated and novel lncRNAs differentially expressed among\nCTRL  FMS  RA  and SLE and assess their function as biomarkers to distinguish FMS  RA  and SLE subjects\nfrom healthy subjects and subjects with other rheumatic diseases Diagnosis of fibromyalgia syndrome and other rheumatic diseases can be a difficult  long and costly process\nand misdiagnosis of these diseases is not uncommon  Long non coding RNAs  lncRNA  are a new class of\nregulatory RNA molecules that exhibit high degrees of cell type specific expression  The hypothesis we will\ntest in this application is that measurement of expression of disease specific lncRNAs in rheumatic diseases\nand fibromyalgia syndrome will have greater utility to provide meaningful clinical information to health care\nproviders faced with these diagnostic dilemmas than measurement of disease specific mRNAs\nRecent advances in DNA sequencing technology have not been matched by improved analytic techniques to\nquickly and accurately interpret patient genome data to inform diagnosis  prognosis and therapy making\ndecisions in the clinic and to identify candidate biomarkers of disease in research laboratories  Development of\nautomated techniques to facilitate interpretation of this data will benefit patient care and improve public health\nby promoting widespread use of cost efficient sequencing clinically and by making it feasible to sequence a\nbroader range of patients including those with complex disease or to identify patients who have an elevated\nrisk of developing future disease  Our long term goal is to commoditize sequence interpretation using high \nthroughput computational techniques in the same way that next generation DNA sequencing technology has\ncommoditized genome data production  The present project will result in commercial software that automates\ngenome sequence interpretation  Specifically  we will develop     software that automatically collects and\norganizes a comprehensive set of genetic information by systematically reading millions of scientific articles\nand scanning dozens of genetic variant databases      software that uses this information to prioritize patient\ndata into clinical categories based on the likelihood of disease  and     software that automatically identifies\ncandidate biomarkers of disease from multi sample cohort data  To do this we will use a variety of innovative\ndata processing techniques  First  we will systematically mutate the reference genome in silico to produce a\ncomprehensive database of every possible mutation at every position of every gene and use this data to query\nevery word of every article ever published or any publicly available database to identify disease gene variant\nassociations  We will compare the results from this automated process to results obtained using more\nexpensive and time consuming manual methods and hypothesize that we can achieve     concordance and\nidentify     more variants and   fold more references for each  These results will be organized into clinically\nmeaningful categories and presented in an interactive graphical interface that displays the evidence for each of\nthese associations  We will then use this information to drive prioritization of patient data based on similarities\nto known disease causing variants and the strength of evidence for their pathogenicity in order to increase\nanalytic sensitivity and specificity thereby improving speed and reliability of sequencing in the clinic  Our\nautomated results will then be compared to conventional methods of data annotation and filtration for andgt      \npatient samples from   diseases  Finally  we will use the same prioritization strategy to comprehensively\ncompare variant data between all patients within a disease cohort to automatically identify the variants most\nlikely to lead to disease and compare our automated results to conventional methods for andgt     samples from\n   diseases  The growth in the $   B genome sequencing market is driven by improvements in informatics\ntechniques and automated solutions such as proposed here have significant commercial potential The successful completion of the proposed project will contribute to the public health mission of\nthe NIH by promoting more widespread adoption of genome sequencing by making the\ninterpretation of this data more accurate and cost effective in clinical and research laboratories \nThe community of users that can benefit from this research include geneticists  oncologists \npathologists  researchers and patients\nAbstract\nThe study of protein ligand binding is one of the central problems in computational biology because of its\nimportance in understanding intermolecular interactions  and because of its practical payoff in drug discovery\nefforts  The transformative impact accurate target ligand structure can have in the design of next generation\nmedicines cannot be overstated  If we could routinely and accurately design molecules using these\napproaches it would revolutionize drug discovery by winnowing out compounds with no activity while focusing\nmore effort and scrutiny on highly active compounds  Determining the structure of a small molecule  drug\ncandidate or lead compound  bound to a biological receptor  protein implicated in disease  is a necessary step\nin this approach to drug discovery  X ray techniques provide astounding insights into the structure of protein \nligand complexes  but can be hampered by the resolution to which a crystal diffracts and the refinement\nprocess can be hampered by the lack of good potentials for novel small molecule compounds  We have\nextended our linear scaling semiempirical quantum mechanical  QM  X ray refinement approach and applied it\nto this field with great success  This approach has proven itself to be robust enough for routine QM based X \nray refinement and it is currently being successfully marketed  However  since refinement methods are\nultimately built on optimization algorithms and do not include sampling  they all suffer from what is termed a\n limited radius of convergence   Therefore  crystallographic workflows   automatic and manual   include ligand\nplacement as part of the model building process  Conventional automatic procedures for ligand placement are\nresolution dependent and are unable to take into account the chemistry of the active site  Further  the ligand\nconformation is often so highly strained that X ray refinement alone  is unable to deduce the proper structure \nWhen this happens  significant intervention on the part of the crystallographer is required  which increases\nexpense and decreases productivity \nIn this proposal we describe a novel method we call Movable Type  MT   which addresses the protein ligand\nbinding and scoring problem using fundamental statistical mechanics combined with a novel way to generate\nthe ensemble of a ligand in a protein binding pocket  Via a rapid assembly of the necessary partition functions\nwe directly obtain binding free energies and the low free energy poses  Conceptually  the MT method is\nanalogous to block and type set printing  which allows us to efficiently evaluate partition functions describing\nregions or systems of interest  In this approach we construct two databases that    describe the probability of\ncertain pairwise interactions as a function of r obtained from a knowledge base  Protein Databank  PDB  or the\nCambridge Structural Database  CSD   and    the energetics of the pairwise interactions as a function of r\nobtained from empirical potentials  which can be either derived from the probabilities or can utilize extant\npairwise potentials like AMBER  Overall  the MT method is a general one and can use a broad range of two \nbody potential functions and can be extended to higher order interactions if so desired  In this project we will\nextend the MT method and deliver this methodology to X ray crystallographers and computational chemists for\nuse in automated ligand placement within the experimental density during X ray refinement  This work will\ninvolve development of a new  automated tool to find the active site ligand density and place the ligand within\nthat density using the MT method  We will commercially deploy the technology  construct graphical user\ninterfaces for use in MOE  Phenix  and our web based cloud platform  Finally  this software will be used in real\nlife structure based drug discovery problems with our pharmaceutical collaborators  see Letters of Support  Project Narrative\nWe will enhance and deploy the movable type method to address the prediction of small\nmolecule binding to drug targets  The resultant methodology and computer program will\nimpact our ability to rapidly and routinely identify biologically active molecules than could\nbe useful in the treatment of a number of diseased states\nProject Summary\nThis Fast Track SBIR project long

This product was conceived in response to four main drivers     the growing\nnumber of adults aging with KOA needing TKR     the need for developing improved patient care\nperioperatively for TKR surgeries     the finding that attending educational classes and performing\nstrengthening exercises prior to TKR improves outcomes and lowers post surgical medical utilization\npotentially saving billions of dollars and    the CMS CJR rule requiring healthcare systems to reduce the cost of\ncare delivery for TKR surgeries  within a diminishing bundled payment  This application is very timely and has\ngreat potential for widespread adoption  as it will be designed based on end user feedback  from all stakeholder\ngroups including people with KOA and the medical care team  Broad Objective  We intend to translate\nexisting evidence based educational material  assessments and exercises to a mobile device for widespread\ndissemination and adoption to prevent functional decline pre and post

SBIR effort to develop a smartphone or tablet based app for caregivers to\nperform non invasive and quantitative measurements of patientsandapos  chronic wounds especially on diabtetic\nfoot ulcers either at care facilities or at patientsandapos  home  Since chronic wounds take months or even\nlonger to heal  it is highly likely that more and more patients will be discharged early from the hospitals \nTo follow up with the wound healing progress  outpatients must routinely visit clinicians for a long period\nof time in order to have their wound healing progress assessed  In addition  current wound assessment\nmethods mostly provide information with poor accuracy and are invasive  The lack of precise wound data\nmakes it difficult for clinicians to track subtle wound changes  thus hindering the correct assessment of\nthe treatment effectiveness  The proposed software technology will be the first reported to offer precise\nwound measurement as well as analysis capabilities on mobile platforms  It will provide great benefit to\nchronic wound patients by providing a low cost  effective  and personalized care solution  With its unique\nframework and many advantages over existing methods  the proprietary technology can be easily\napplied to the benefit of diagnosis and treatment on other type of wounds and diseases such as burns \nacute wounds  battle wounds  and tumor irradiation treatment  It also has substantial potential for\nimproving access to emergency care in any remote regions  With the ability of diagnosis and treatment\nremotely  we expect that our technology will completely change the landscape of the multi billion dollar\nwound care market \n There are approximately     million patients in the U S  suffering from chronic wounds such as\ndiabetic foot ulcers and pressure ulcers  and approximately         patients hospitalized every year with\nnew wounds  The burden of treating chronic wounds is also growing rapidly due to increasing health\ncare costs  an aging population  and a sharp rise in the incidence of diabetes and obesity worldwide  It is\nclaimed that an excess of $   billion is spent annually on the treatment of chronic wounds  Undoubtedly \nthe development of a mobile platform based  D wound assessment tool is significant and will provide a\nmuch needed solution Project Narrative\n The proposed mobile app to be developed under this SBIR project will provide clinicians\na convenient yet comprehensive diagnosis and measurement tool  empowering them to provide\npersonalized and timely care for chronic ulcer sufferers such as diabetic foot ulcers  With its\nunique client server framework and many advantages over existing methods  the proposed app\nwill have a reasonably large market share in this rapidly growing multi billion dollar industry  The\nproprietary mobile health technology can be used for ambulatory wound care  battle wound\ncares  and wound cares for any remote or limited access locations\nRespiratory syncytial virus  RSV  can cause lower respiratory illness  LRI  in otherwise healthy children\nand developing an effective prophylactic vaccine to mitigate RSV disease in infants is a public and global\nhealth priority according to the World Health Organization  The overall goal of this project is to develop a safe\nand efficacious RSV vaccine for immunizing sero negative   months to   years old infants  who are beyond the\nreach of protective RSV maternal antibodies  against RSV hospitalizations and medically attended LRI \nGlobally  there are    million new RSV infections annually with     million hospitalizations and        to\n        deaths  Although most people are infected in the first year of life  recurring RSV infections occur\nthroughout life  It was estimated that in the US    million children under the age of   required care for RSV\ninfections annually and     are over the age of one year  In the US  medical costs for managing RSV disease\nin infants were estimated at $     billion annually with additional lost income and caregiver costs estimated at\n$    million annually  Vaccinating the birth cohort with a RSV vaccine that has     efficacy and protection for\n   months was estimated to reduce medical costs by $    million and income and productivity losses by $   \nmillion annually in the US \n A live attenuated RSV vaccine mimics natural RSV infection  RSV epidemiology and natural history\nstudies have demonstrated that natural infection results in lasting protection against severe RSV disease  The\nMoore lab recently published on a vaccine candidate that was uniquely engineered to replicate like wild type\nvirus in infected cells and yet is less able to spread because of the down regulation of virulence genes  The\nattenuation phenotype is stable because it is conferred by hundreds of mutations in the RSV genome  The\nother distinguishing characteristic is a proprietary fusion protein that is enriched for the more immunogenic pre \nfusion conformation  The combination of these properties resulted in high levels of attenuation in cotton rats\nwith almost wtRSV level neutralizing antibodies and complete protection against wtRSV challenge making this\na promising vaccine candidate for clinical development \n In Phase   the objectives are to generate research stocks of two live attenuated RSV vaccine\ncandidates called OE  and DB Quad and establish a pre seed process that can be transferred to a cGMP\nfacility for initiation of vaccine production  In Phase    we will evaluate attenuation of OE  and DB Quad in\nhuman airway epithelial cells ex vivo and in cotton rats in vivo and perform studies in cotton rats to verify that\nthey do not cause RSV vaccine enhanced disease  The outcome of these studies will allow Meissa complete\nIND enabling pharmacology studies and to prioritize a lead candidate for clinical development Respiratory syncytial virus  RSV  is the most important pathogen for lower respiratory tract infection in infants \nbut there are no approved vaccines  RSV live attenuated vaccines  LAV  are the most clinically advanced\ncandidates but have two main problems  lack of potency and genetic instability  This study will compare two\nnovel RSV LAVs with improved potency and stability in relevant pre clinical models  in preparation for taking a\nlead candidate to clinical trial !\nProject Summary\nThe broad long term objective of this Fast Track proposal is to develop an innovative self management intervention\n SMI  technology

Inspiration Point\n    for   weeks  and the outcomes will be similar to or better than usual care  Health relatedness  Management of chronic\nconditions is one of our most important healthcare priorities given that more than     of all healthcare costs and     of\nMedicare annual spend are attributed to chronic disease  Behavioral choices are at the heart of chronic disease self \nmanagement models  SMIs  a key constituent of the national respiratory guidelines  empower active  informed \ncollaboration in health related decision making  engagement in healthy behaviors and development of problem solving\nskills to address challenges their disease presents  Inspiration Point     will be a SMI for adults with COPD Narrative\nCOPD is the third leading cause of mortality in the US  While there is no cure  chronic disease self management\ninterventions can improve quality of life for those living with COPD  This proposal aims to develop Inspiration Point  a\nCOPD self management intervention with an initial focus on elements contained in traditional pulmonary rehabilitation\nas a research and intervention tool to improve quality of life and reduce the overall healthcare costs\nDespite the myriad major advances in cardiology  the prognosis for patients with severe  medically\nrefractive heart failure  HF  is exceedingly poor  Approximately         deaths occur annually in\npatients with HF who have endured an impaired quality of life often accompanied by significant\neconomic and personal losses due to recurrent hospitalizations  At least        of these deaths were\ndirectly related to severe heart failure  Because the number of available heart donors         year  has\nnot increased over the last decade  there is an enormous and expanding gap between medical need for\ntransplant and the woefully low supply of hearts \n Todayandapos s axial and centrifugal flow left ventricular assist devices  LVAD  have reduced size and\npower requirements  allowing LVADs to become a therapeutic options as a bridge to transplantation\n BTT  and increasingly for destination therapy  DT   Unfortunately the life saving benefit of LVADs is\noffset by potential life threatening complications and costly hospital readmissions for bleeding  infection \nand thrombosis  Prophylactic anticoagulation to prevent intra pump thrombus with warfarin  in addition\nto an anti platelet drug  exacerbates inherent bleeding complications induced by the high shear high\nblood flow conditions of the pumps  Multicenter efforts to reduce anticoagulation guidelines tripled the\nincidence of pump thrombotic complications  LDH  a nonspecific marker of RBC lysis  is currently used\nas the best surrogate indicator for pump thrombosis  But  given clinical results to date  LDH is only an\ninsensitive probably late biomarker of LVAD fibrin accumulation \n We have innovated and demonstrated a very high avidity nuclear probe prototype    mTc F A  in\nvitro  in excised LVADs operated ex vivo  and in rodent models  which sensitively localizes thrombus\naccumulation in LVADs  In Phase   of this Fast track proposal the effectiveness of   mTc F A will

\nFibroScint is anticipated to refine and individualize LVAD clinical management to reduce\nbleeding events  thromboembolic complications and pump exchanges \n!Despite the myriad major advances in cardiology  the prognosis for patients with severe  medically\nrefractive HF is exceeding poor  Left ventricular assist devices  LVAD   a mechanical circulatory support\nsystem  have developed tremendously and offer considerable hope and benefit to patients with severe HF \nHowever  they are associated with gastrointestinal  GI  bleeding  driveline infections  and thrombotic\ncomplications  Successful LVAD outcomes require careful management of anticoagulation and the complex\ninterplay between increased bleeding and prevention of intrapump thrombus  Unfortunately  multicenter efforts\nto lower anticoagulation goals to minimize bleeding complications resulted in a tripled incidence of pump\nthrombotic complications  Intra pump thrombus cannot be directly diagnosed but only inferred from nonspecific\nevidence and these suggestive markers of pump thrombus are late findings  Intrapump thrombus detected\nearlier may be responsive to anti thrombotic treatment or progression

NASH will progress and develop life threatening conditions\nincluding fibrosis  cirrhosis  hepatocellular carcinoma  and liver failure  By the year       NASH is projected to\nbe the leading indication for liver transplantation surpassing hepatitis C virus  HCV  and alcoholic related\ncirrhosis  and by       the total NASH pharmaceutical market size is estimated to reach $   billion  Currently \nthe liver biopsy is the  gold standard  for diagnosing and monitoring NASH  yet it is invasive  expensive\n  $        and associated with significant patient morbidities  Importantly  a single biopsy provides only an\ninstantaneous `snapshotandapos  of tissue architecture and is unable to identify NASH patients who are `rapid\nprogressorsandapos  and thus urgently require treatment  or those on therapy that are `respondersandapos   As a result of these\nlimitations  liver biopsy remains the key bottleneck in the safe  accurate diagnosis and monitoring of NASH \nThis proposal aims to develop the Glympse liver test  GLT   a noninvasive urine diagnostic that detects the\nactivity of hepatic proteases that drive NASH  GLT consists of an injectable panel of nanosensors that detect\nproteases involved with inflammation and fibrosis  and produce signals that are detected in urine  The\ndetection signals are amplified by enzymatic action in the liver and then concentrated in the patientandapos s urine for\nquantification by mass spectrometry  Because enzyme activity is measurable at the molecular level before\nmicroscopic changes are evident by biopsy  the test is thus both ultrasensitive and predictive  We will\ndemonstrate the feasibility of formulating GLT nanosensors on an inert polymer scaffold to sense matrix\nmetalloproteinases  MMPs    a key family of enzymes that are involved in NASH progression and regression \nWe will then validate the ability of GLT to predict disease progression and regression in a mouse model of\nNASH  and conduct preclinical toxicology studies in preparation for an IND submission  The GLT will offer\nclinicians a rapid determination of the state and trajectory of the patientandapos s liver without the morbidity of biopsy \nreduce cost of diagnosis from $      to $     and raise sensitivity by      The benefit to the healthcare\nsystem per patient is estimated to be $       in reduced biopsy associated costs and $        in drug costs\nover a patientandapos s lifetime  saving more than $   billion annually for the     of NASH patients with progressive\ndisease alone  The impact of the adoption of GLT will reach across multiple constituencies   increasing patient\ncare and comfort  improving physician decision making  accelerating pharmaceutical drug trials  and lowering\nhealthcare costs Project Narrative\nNonalcoholic steatohepatitis  NASH  is a deadly type of fatty liver disease that progresses to liver cancer and\nliver failure  yet the biopsy remains the diagnostic standard despite its invasiveness and limited predictive power \nWe will develop a new noninvasive urine diagnostic that can predict NASH progression and regression to\ntransform the care of NASH patients\nAbstract\nThe goal of this Fast track application is to develop a non invasive diagnostic test  based on MUC  and MUC  \nmucins  that can serve as an adjunct to cytological analysis of fine needle aspirates  FNAs  for accurate\nprediction of malignancy in patients with cystic pancreatic lesions  Due to asymptomatic nature and lack of\nmethods for early detection  andgt      of pancreatic cancer  PC  patients present with an unresectable primary\ntumor with distant metastasis at the time of diagnosis  While the overall   year survival rate of pancreatic cancer\nis dismal  signi cantly better outcomes have been reported for smaller tumors detected at an earlier stage  Slow\ndevelopment of PC in conjunction with the better curative response of patients with early disease underscore\nthe need of early detection of pancreatic cancer  Pancreatic cystic lesions  earlier considered to be rare  are\nincreasingly being recognized due to increased number of individuals being subjected to diagnostic imaging \nhowever  their exact prevalence is unknown  These cystic pancreatic lesions have variable malignant potential \nwhile mucinous cystic neoplasms  MCNs  and intraductal pancreatic mucinous neoplasms  IPMNs  have a high\nprobability of developing into malignant lesions  serous cystic neoplasms  SCNs  are considered benign \nDespite the critical need  accurate discrimination between high  and low risk cystic lesions is challenging due\nto their symptomatic and radiographic similarities  Although cytologic examination of endoscopic ultrasound\n EUS  guided fine needle aspirates  FNAs  has emerged as an indispensable part of presurgical evaluation  in\npractice          of such analyses are inconclusive and unreliable in discriminating between serous and\nmucinous lesions  Using anti MUC  MAb  G  generated by our group several studies have established that\ncell surface mucin MUC  is promising prognostic and diagnostic biomarker  Further MUC  and MUC  \nexhibited      specificity for malignancy in EUS FNAs containing atypical ductal epithelial cells  The central\nhypothesis of this proposal Detection of MUC  and or MUC   in pancreatic tissues  EUS FNAs  is positively\ncorrelated with the presence of already existing pancreatic cancer or cystic lesions with malignant potential and\nthus MUC     staining is a powerful tool for the accurate prediction of malignancy and pre surgical stratification\nof patients with cystic lesions of the pancreas  Studies proposed for Phase I will result in the development of a\nprototype kit for MUC MUC   IHC  Aim    and provide proof of concept in support of the aforementioned\nhypothesis  Studies proposed in Phase II will validate the significance of MUC     immunostaining in a blinded\ntrial and determine how MUC     expression correlates with the clinical outcome of the solid cystic pancreatic\ndiseases  Aim     Further  we propose to test the prototype kit in a clinical setting  CLIA Lab  to validate\nperformance  Aim     Overall  the proposal will lead to the development of a clinical test to stratify patients for\nsurgical intervention or surveillance in the context of pancreatic cystic lesions and PC Project Narrative\nEndoscopic Ultrasound  EUS  based Fine Needle Aspirates  FNAs  represent a valuable pre surgical diagnostic\nmaterial for confirming the presence or risk malignant lesions in the pancreas  however their diagnostic utility is\nlimited due to the poor sensitivity of cytological analysis particularly in cases exhibiting atypical epithelial cells \nAccurate diagnosis of malignant lesions of the pancreas can provide opportunity for intervention at a curable\nstage and reduce the risk of surgery associate morbidity in patients harboring benign lesions  The proposed\nstudies will validate if MUC  and MUC   staining in EUS FNAs can predict the risk of malignant lesions and\nhelp in appropriate patient selection for surgical resection\nABSTRACT\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease  NAFLD  is a chronic condition that originates as lipid\naccumulation within hepatocytes  steatosis  and progresses into nonalcoholic steatohepatitis\n NASH   characterized by lipid accumulation  inflammation  oxidative stress  and fibrosis  An\nestimated     million adults across the U S  are thought to have NAFLD  with up to    million\nmore estimated to have NASH  Left unchecked  the disease can advance to cirrhosis and\nhepatocellular carcinoma  Currently  NASH contributes to one third of hepatocellular carcinomas\nin the US and is the second leading cause of liver transplants in the US  NASH is often referred\nto as a  silent  disease as most patients are asymptomatic until problems arise from cirrhosis\nand liver failure and diagnosis only possible via invasive liver biopsies  Despite well defined\nmorphological features and decades of intense research worldwide  the mechanisms of NAFLD\nprogression as well as

human hepatocytes  hepatic stellates and endothelial cells that better\nmimics native human liver biology over extended time in culture  The technological\nadvancement of  D bioprinting enables controlled  reproducible fabrication of  D liver tissues ex\nvivo from human cells  yielding a durable liver model with complex composition and architecture\nthat retains metabolic competence and liver specific functions for at least   weeks in culture \nThe current Fast Track SBIR application seeks to utilize ExVive  Human Liver Tissue to model\nthe onset and progression of human NAFLD via nutrient overload in the first Phase  followed by\ninduction of inflammation  oxidative stress and fibrosis to mimic human NASH in the second\nPhase  Importantly  in order to drive adoption  the steatosis and NASH models will be validated\nvia comparisons of genomic data with clinically confirmed NAFLD patient data in collaboration\nwith key opinion leader Dr  David Brenner  and verification of altered drug metabolism and\ndisposition via CYP A  and  C  activities  Lastly  prevention of NAFLD progression and\nregression of NASH will be assessed via therapeutic modulation of disease phenotypes \nTogether  these in vitro models have the potential to significantly impact liver disease research\nby enabling the discovery of novel therapeutics  biomarkers to non invasively delineate NASH\nfrom steatosis  and allow the safety assessment of drugs in a disease relevant background PROJECT NARRATIVE\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease  NAFLD  is a chronic condition that originates as

patterned electrical micro \nstimulation has been severely constrained by technical limitations  Foremost among these limitations are the\nproblems associated with simultaneous recording and micro stimulation  Stimulation artifacts are up to four\norders of magnitude larger than the neural signal being sensed  The large signal drives the amplifiers outside\nof their linear range and traditional AC coupled amplifiers require long settling times to recover  These long\nsettling times are due to long time constants created by low frequency high pass filters  One traditional\napproach to avoid amplifier saturation is to employ switches for electrode  headstage amplifier  and stimulator\nconnections to rapidly switch between recording and stimulation  Switches must be employed to disconnect the\nstimulator when recording to avoid amplifier saturation and degrading the high impedance electrode signal\nfrom parasitic cable capacitances and interference sources  This project will develop a research tool for\nneuroscientists that will achieve electrical stimulation and neural signal recording from the same\nmicroelectrode  Multiple channels of simultaneous recording and micro stimulation from the same electrode\nare combined on the same integrated circuit  IC  for integration in a headstage  The integration in an IC\neliminates signal degradation and interference from cabling and switching parasitic effects  Additionally  the\nlow noise amplifier circuitry  stimulation circuitry and local control may be intimately tied to mitigate the\nelectrode polarization recovery Project Narrative\nA greater understanding of the neuronal mechanisms underlying cognitive function is unlikely to emerge until\nseveral technical hurdles can be overcome  New instruments are needed to characterize the relationships\nbetween cognitive behaviors and the spatiotemporal patterns of neuronal activity in the distributed circuits that\nmediate those behaviors  These approaches must be combined with the ability to make specific and targeted\nmanipulations of neuronal activity to establish causal physiological links between behavior and network\ndynamics\nProject Summary\n Alzheimer s disease  AD  is expected to rise in prevalence from   to    million Americans by      \nleading to     of deaths among adults over     This epidemic is projected to overwhelm healthcare and\neconomic resources  with costs reaching $    billion in the US in      and $  trillion by       There is no cure\nfor AD  and no new drugs have been successful in treating the advanced stages of AD related dementia  A\ngrowing body of research suggests that early phases of the disease  such as Mild Cognitive Impairment  MCI \nand mild AD  are more likely to be responsive to disease modifying compounds  Drug development strategies\nare focused primarily on prevention and early intervention in these high risk  early AD populations  Advances in\nclinical trials will require psychometrically rigorous measures capable of detecting subtle cognitive and functional\nchanges indicative of the early disease process  Accurate assessment of functional capacity is especially critical\nfor determining whether investigational treatments provide meaningful therapeutic benefit to everyday\nfunctioning  Many tests of functional ability are designed to assess basic activities of daily living  ADLs  such as\nbathing and eating  However  these skills are typically preserved in MCI and mild AD  In these early phases \nsubtle but observable deficits are more likely to occur in instrumental ADLs  IADLs  such as shopping and\ncooking  At present  there are limited options for reliable  sensitive determination of IADL functioning in these\ncritical populations  The shortcomings of traditional functional assessments used in AD drug trials have been\nwell established and include biases in caregiver reports  lack of established reliability  and outdated role play\ntasks  Despite growing scientific consensus regarding the need for improved measurement of functional\ncapacity  no new assessments have been developed for use in MCI or mild AD  NeuroCog Trials developed the\nVirtual Reality Functional Capacity Assessment Tool  VRFCAT  as a computerized performance based\nassessment of functional capacity designed to simulate real world IADLs  Using a realistic virtual environment \nthe VRFCAT assesses functional performance in the context of a typical trip to the grocery store  Initially\ndeveloped for use in patients with severe mental illness  the VRFCAT has demonstrated strong psychometric\nproperties and has been implemented in large scale clinical trials for schizophrenia and major depression  The\nproposed Fast Track project will create and validate a new version of the VRFCAT specifically for MCI and mild\nAD  VRFCAT MCI  based on established standards for adapting computerized cognitive tests for new target\ngroups  Pilot testing will assess the suitability of the existing VRFCAT and identify any needed software\ncustomizations  In Phase II  we will execute a comprehensive validation study to examine the psychometric\nproperties of the VRFCAT MCI  broadening the commercial and scientific value of this innovative tool in an effort\nto accelerate breakthrough treatments to delay  slow  and prevent AD Project Narrative\nTraditional functional assessments used in Alzheimer s disease  AD  drug trials lack sensitivity to subtle deficits\nobserved early in the disease  at the stages of mild cognitive impairment  MCI  and mild AD

cited frequently by this Institute  Professional American women andamp  those from all developed nations increasingly delay childbearing for several years compared to the past because of career advancement and increasing social acceptability  This problem is not solely a woman s health issue but equally affects men as only     of infertility is attributable solely to women  while an estimated equal     is attributable to the male partner who also contributes to another     of combined female andamp  male causes \nCurrently  recombinant  r  human  h  follicle stimulating hormone  FSH  is the single largest therapeutic component of the infertility market with sales considerably in excess of $  billion per year  of which        of that total over $    Million per year in the much higher priced and growing US market and another     in the European market  Several infertility consultants to the Trophogen PIs have confirmed that rhFSH therapy for infertility is much too expensive for most American women as the cost is not covered by insurance in many states and  even if covered  there are often prohibitive out of pocket costs  In addition  the results with current rhFSH treatments are far from optimal with only an average response rate of        per cycle  and much worse for women over     especially for greatly under reported  poor responders   The latter include both to conventional first line in vivo FSH stimulation performed with intrauterine insemination  IUI  as well as to more effective but costly and invasive in vitro fertilization  IVF   Poor responders often produce fewer than   oocytes per superovulation cycle of variable quality and may require repeated cycles up to   or more to achieve a full term pregnancy  if they are successful at all  with devastating emotional and financial cost to infertile couples  Moreover  rhFSH stimulation is an important component of many rapidly growing additional markets limited only by cost  elective

world!\nSympathetic innervation of the heart plays a critical role in arrhythmogenesis and recent studies have\nhighlighted the role of surgical sympathetic denervation in management of refractory ventricular arrhythmias \nThe procedure although safe is very invasive and performed via thoracoscopy using single lung ventilation \nThis is not tolerated by patients with lung disease or severe structural heart disease  Our proposal will\nvalidate a completely new minimally invasive method for cardiac sympathetic denervation that can be\nperformed in the interventional labs to replace the current surgical denervation to treat arrhythmic\ndisorders of the heart \nOur approach is novel in that we are able to exploit the anatomy of the cardiac nerves to achieve bilateral\nsympathetic denervation at a single site in front of the tracheal bifurcation  We will also validate an acute assay\nfor denervation that will guide the procedure and ensure success by acute confirmation and safety of the\nprocedure by avoiding unnecessary ablation \nThis project will be completed in several sequential stages  In Phase I we will demonstrate the proof of concept\nby demonstrating anesthetic block of the cardiac sympathetic nerves in the pretracheal region and abolishing\nthe cardiac sympathetic response to electrical stimulation of bilateral stellate ganglia  We will show the\nfeasibility and efficacy of RF ablation in the pre tracheal region in abolishing the stellate sympathetic response\nand demonstrate acute safety  In Phase II of this proposal we will design and build a stand alone human grade\ntrans bronchial ablation device with ultrasound imaging capabilities that will enable easy and safe access to\nthe pretracheal space to achieve ablation of the deep cardiac plexus  We will demonstrate safety and durability\nof transtracheal RF ablation in a porcine chronic survival model \nSympathetic over activity is uniformly associated with poor survival in all forms of heart disease  Successful\ncompletion of the specific aims will lead to development of a novel method and a device to interrupt cardiac\nsympathetic nerves  Abolishing cardiac response to abnormal neurally mediated sympathetic discharge may\nhave an enormous role in treatment of other cardiac arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation and cardiac disorders\nassociated with abnormal sympathovagal balance such as heart failure Ventricular arrhythmias occur in patients with structural heart disease and lead to significant increase in\nmorbidity and mortality  Current management with medications is palliative and catheter ablation techniques\nhave a high failure rate  The nervous system plays an important role in ventricular arrhythmias and surgical\ndenervation of the heart significantly reduces arrhythmias even in resistant cases  This proposal will validate a\nnew minimally invasive method for cardiac sympathetic denervation that can be performed in the interventional\nlabs to replace the current surgical denervation to treat arrhythmic disorders of the heart\nThis project develops a system that improves communication between a patient and their audiologist, simplify the fitting and tuning process by allowing patients to remotely record their hearing aid (HA) experience via a smartphone application. Currently, only 28.5% of individuals who could benefit from a HA actually wears one. The goal of this project is to improve patient satisfaction with their HA, with the aim to increase and prolong continued use. The objectives are: (1) Develop a smartphone application and wireless interface to low-level HA functionality; (2) develop a cloud-based back-end system with a web-based audiologist interface; and (3) evaluate system with end users through a human trial.\nThis project designs, fabricates, and completes engineering verification of a hydraulic actuator for a novel prosthetic ankle-foot system. The goal of this project is to improve balance and balance confidence of persons with lower extremity amputations by developing a prosthetic ankle that has biomimetic modes for walking and standing. This bimodal ankle provides flexibility for walking mobility and rigidity for standing stability. The objectives are to: (1) Develop (design and fabricate) a hydraulic actuator that allows movement for walking and restricts movement for standing; and (2) to perform engineering verification of the actuator assembly.\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be to help control nutrient contaminants in soil and water for the benefit of the world?s population, by providing sustainable access to safe drinking water. The estimated national economic cost of nitrogen pollution in drinking water is $19 billion annually, while the cost to freshwater ecosystems is $78 billion per year. Traditional water-quality monitoring practices are based on &quot;grab-samples&quot; that are sent for laboratory analyses that may take days to weeks to be completed. Similar traditional approaches are found in agriculture where excessive application of nitrate-based fertilizers may result in agricultural runoff that carries pollution to ground and surface water sources. The proposed high-performance, low-cost optical sensor technology will enable deployment of a dense real-time monitoring network in freshwater sources, water treatment facilities, and farms, and will gain a significant foothold in the $6.8B global water quality monitoring equipment market. In the event of natural disasters, integration of the proposed nitrate sensor will be useful in assessment of water quality in local water resources, providing communities with real-time information on water safety. This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project focuses on the development of a non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) detector for real-time monitoring of nitrate concentration in water. This effort will combine nitrate-selective ion-exchange membrane technology with today&apos;s low-cost infrared (IR) components for the design of a new type of sensor targeting applications in aqueous environment. The proposed technology relies on infrared optical fibers for signal transmission. Currently, the use of commercial real-time optical nitrate sensors, based on ultra-violet (UV) absorption, is limited due to the optical interferences in the UV spectra related to the inorganic and organic substances, and reduced UV transmission caused by turbidity. The proposed proprietary IR technology is designed to overcome these shortcomings through implementation of smart membrane filtering. The instrument will provide high frequency data collection in dynamic aqueous environments with a wide sensitivity range (1 to 100 ppm). This technology can be further expanded for measurement of additional nutrients and contaminants, making it a robust tool for water quality assessment.\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the rapid, cost-effective detection of natural gas leakage to improve public safety, mitigate global climate change, and decrease product loss. Natural gas is the largest provider of power in the United States. However, more than 80 Tg of leakage occurs at well pads and pipelines during production alone. Such leakage poses a public health risk, with 1300 significant incidents reported from 1997 ? 2016, resulting in 50 fatalities, 180 injuries, and $2B in costs. Additionally, methane is a greenhouse gas with a warming potential that is 84 times higher than CO2. In 2015, natural gas leakage accounted for 198 million tons of CO2 equivalents, corresponding to a carbon tax value of more than $2B. Finally, energy companies want to reduce leakage to avoid product loss, with 80 Tg of methane having a value of $12B. This project will directly impact the aforementioned areas by improving the efficiencies and costs associated with natural gas leak detection. With over 2.2 million miles of local utility gas distribution pipelines 1.2 million well pads in the U.S. alone, the commercial prospects for an improved natural gas leak detection system are very promising with expected revenues exceeding $70M. This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will involve the development of a comprehensive natural gas leakage detection solution that integrates compact, low-cost sensors with state-of-the-art analytics. The solution, which can be used in drone-based and handheld monitoring, will enable energy providers to detect natural gas leakage from well pads and pipelines. In Phase I, technical feasibility will be demonstrated by the development of a lightweight gas sensor based on incoherent, cavity-enhanced spectrometry and a natural gas camera based on filtered infrared imaging. These sensors will be integrated with global positioning system, wind speed/direction, and data analytics platform. The Phase I solution will be laboratory tested to characterize its analytical performance, before undergoing field testing on controlled natural gas leaks. In Phase II, the sensor hardware, electronics, and firmware will be refined to meet the stringent size, weight, power, and environmental constraints of drone-based and handheld deployment. Likewise, the analytics platform will be refined to incorporate the STTR sensors, interpret the infrared camera data, and provide comprehensive leak detection reports. The Phase II prototypes will be field tested under real-world conditions with a variety of potential customers for both well pad monitoring and pipeline distribution system monitoring.\nThis SBIR Phase 1 project is aimed at providing technology to address the high costs of developing effective and safe drugs. Bringing a new drug to market typically involves screening 100?s of thousands of compounds for efficacy and toxicity utilizing cell, tissue and animal models to ultimately select a lead compound that will be tested in clinical trials. This process can take years, billions of dollars, and in the worse case leads to compounds that fail during clinical trials due to safety concerns. Advances in microfluidics and 3D-printing have enabled the construction of tissue culture devices with nearly unlimited numbers of tissue chambers and flow channel complexity. Combined with optical sensors with unprecedented sensitivity, instrumentation can be built that maintain large numbers of biopsied tissue samples, while assessing the effects of exposure of the tissue to libraries of drugs. This technological platform provides resolution of drug effects on human tissue with high sensitivity thereby reducing the cost of animal testing and the risk of bringing toxic drugs to clinical trials and the market. In addition, the technology will impact the fields of personalized medicine, where drugs could be tested on an individual?s own tumor or tissue, and environmental health. Measuring in vitro cellular responses to pharmaceutical compounds is critical for identifying toxic effects of candidate drugs prior to costly in vivo animal and clinical testing. To address this need, instrumentation to maintain and assess biopsied tissue in real time is being developed. The technology utilizes microfluidics for optimal maintenance of tissue viability and function, and optoelectronics to measure oxygen uptake with unprecedented sensitivity. The fluidics are driven by gas pressure, circumventing the need for unwieldy pumps, and the channels are fabricated by 3D printing, allowing for nearly unlimited numbers of chambers and flow channel complexity. The technological platform will aid in the selection of lead compounds for clinical trials, estimation of doses for first-in-human tests, and support applications to the FDA. In this Phase 1 SBIR proposal we will build 2 96-channel turnkey instruments for a contract research program and for beta testing by pharmaceutical companies. The functionality of a low-capacity (8-channel) system has been previously demonstrated. The funding will support scaling up the throughput of the system as well as enabling additional modes of operation. The instrumentation will be used for contract research and for direct sales to the large market of drug discovery within the pharmaceutical industry.\nThis STTR Phase I project will remove the most critical roadblock to making long-lasting batteries from safe and economical zinc and air. Zinc is plentiful in the U.S. and zinc-air batteries have the potential to hold more than five times the energy of current lithium-ion batteries, but a key challenge for making rechargeable zinc-air batteries is that the zinc inside the battery naturally forms sharp needles called dendrites during recharging. Over time these dendrites can grow large enough to damage the inner workings of the battery, reducing efficiency and lifetime. This project will borrow principles from an adjacent field, the electroplating industry, to create new organic chemicals that will seek out and stop dendrite growth within the battery during recharging. Chemical additives have a long history in electroplating for controlling the shape of metal surfaces, and the same principles can apply to additives designed here to control zinc growth during battery recharging. This new technology will make zinc-air batteries cheaper and longer-lasting to eventually replace existing battery technologies, enabling longer-distance electric vehicles, reducing equipment weight for soldiers, contributing a valuable technology to the economy, and helping to maintain the role of the U.S. as a leader in energy storage technology. This STTR Phase I project will identify the critical chemistry necessary to elegantly and economically suppress zinc dendrite formation, alleviating one of the most significant challenges complicating the full commercial emergence of Zn-Air battery technology. Eschewing the established tactic of applying existing chemicals from the catalog, this project will take inspiration from the PI?s experience designing additives for similar environments in the electroplating industry to introduce novel proprietary organic chemistry addressing the dendrite bottleneck directly. The key technical challenge will be to optimize the molecular features to simultaneously provide efficient dendrite suppression and low voltage loss. A broad series of molecules will be created to combine strong interactions with zinc, modest polarization, low cost and straightforward scalability. Evaluating and iterating upon these candidates in bench-scale electrochemical analyses and performance tests in coin and pouch cell batteries will yield a dendrite-suppressing product to bring significant value to Zn-Air technology and other Zn-based battery markets. At its successful conclusion, this project will not only produce products for these markets, but it will also provide molecular design principles useful for the development of other metal-based battery additives, and promote the merits of novel additive development for the broader battery industry.\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is in automating the process of unbiased stereology, the state-of-the-method used in the life sciences for counting stained cells on tissue sections. Unbiased stereology allows neuroscientists to accurately analyze the size and number of brain cells, which are altered in many neurological disorders and mental illnesses. For reasons that are currently unknown, Alzheimer&apos;s disease, Parkinson&apos;s disease and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis are all associated with a progressive loss of brain cells. In contrast, children with autism are born with too many brain cells, which leads to life-long problems in processing complex streams of information. Stereology plays an important role in investigating many conditions affecting the brain and assessing the efficacy and safety of possible treatments. Though the proposed technology will initially target research studies to understand and treat all neurological conditions, it can be useful for automatic assessments of cells in all tissues, including cancer screening and diagnosis from biopsies. The proposed project will develop and optimize an algorithm to help brain scientists identify causes and treatments for neurological disease and mental illness. The proposed technology will use deep learning (artificial intelligence) systems to automatically recognize, count and size brain cells on tissue sections. An important use of this technology will be to analyze brains and nerve tissue from mice and rats treated to show similar neurological diseases as those found in humans. These animal models provide a powerful tool for testing treatments to cure brain disease in humans. Currently stereology studies of tissues from these animals require a trained technician to sit before a computer screen making tedious manual counts of hundreds and thousands of microscopic cells. This outdated approach fails to take advantage of powerful deep learning methods proposed for the proposed software that could complete these tasks 10 times faster and with fewer errors and human biases. Therefore, the proposed technology will use deep learning technology to accelerate basic research and drug development in the U.S., thereby establishing a long-term economic engine and bringing significant benefits to society through scientific breakthroughs and medical discoveries.\nThis STTR Phase I project will undertake the development of iron coordination complexes as alternatives for gadolinium contrast agents which are currently used in clinical MRI diagnostic exams. New MRI contrast agents are needed to serve the segment of the population who cannot tolerate Gd(III) agents. This includes patients with kidney disease and those who have frequent MRI scans and may accumulate Gd(III). The proposed research involves the study of new trivalent iron coordination complexes based on those initially studied in the co-PI?s university laboratory. New iron complexes will be prepared and studied as contrast agents in live mice to improve characteristics of the agents such as clearance from the body. Fundamental studies of the iron complexes will add to the body of knowledge on the paramagnetic properties of iron. For the most promising Fe(III) contrast agents, the synthetic procedures will be adapted for large scale preparation and purity determination. Iron MRI contrast agents may also be beneficial to society by reducing gadolinium in water supply. Furthermore, iron as an abundant element is less expensive and more readily available in the USA than is gadolinium. The commercialization of iron MRI contrast agents will create jobs in chemical manufacturing, sales, and in health-related occupations. The lead Fe(III) coordination complex on which this project is based produces longitudinal (T1) relaxivity of water protons that rival clinically used Gd(III) complexes at 4.7 Tesla, both under in vitro conditions and also in live mice. Importantly, these complexes contain macrocyclic ligands that stabilize iron in the trivalent state (negative redox potentials versus NHE) and do not produce reactive oxygen species even in the presence of ascorbate as a reductant and peroxide. The importance of outersphere water and innersphere water interactions will be studied by varying the coordinating pendent groups on the macrocyclic ligand which is bound to Fe(III). The ancillary group will be varied to increase binding to serum proteins and to modify the clearance route of the contrast agents either through kidneys or through hepatobiliary routes. The complexes will be optimized for kinetic inertness towards release of iron under biologically relevant conditions. Toxicity studies in cell culture will be carried out on each of the new complexes. This research will focus on both pilot scale preparation for the study of the Fe(III) complexes in vitro and also on larger scale preparations and HPLC analysis of the most promising new derivatives. In vivo MRI scans in mice on a 4.7 T scanner will be used to track the distribution and clearance of the iron contrast agents as a function of time.\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project include enabling the minimally invasive treatment of a large variety of conditions. This is expected to be achieved through the development of a steerable needle that can reach arbitrary positions in the human body that are not reachable by a straight needle from a simple needle hole. The long term impact of the proposed technology is in targeted delivery of medicine, or the removal of tissue such as biopsies, or treatment mechanisms such as ablation devices. An overarching goal of the proposed project is the availability of minimally invasive procedures that can replace more drastic surgery options. The development of this device has the potential to also save lives, treating what otherwise would be inoperable conditions due to the location of tumors blocked by sensitive organs or bones. The proposed project, if successful, will lead to demonstrating the application of a device that utilizes the buckling behavior of semi-curved beams to controllably alter the stiffness in a needle for cancer treatment and measure its efficacy in terms of the advantages over straight needles. The objectives of this research include: developing a prototype and match to surgeon use cases (interventional radiologist) and testing and characterizing the steerability performance while delivering the medical payload. Specifically, it is expected that the first therapeutic application of this technology will be microwave ablation of cancer tumors.\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the first time commercial development of a copper cable which can transmit and store energy. Currently, copper cables are used for transmitting electricity. Adding energy storage capability to these cables is transformative and has the potential to be employed in a myriad of electrical and electronic applications. Making these cables into spools of wires and custom sliced into a certain length to achieve a required capacitance will be very attractive to commercial applications. The proposed study enables to understand how energy transmission and storage can be simultaneously performed without mutual interference. These cables can find niche applications in the automotive, energy, defense, and IT industries. Moreover, when made into thin wires, it can be weaved into a matrix which can be used to charge wearable devices. For example, currently, a soldier carries about 30-40 pounds of battery for a three-day mission. However, if energy storage devices like the one proposed here can be made into an advanced textile form and can be worn as a uniform, the weight currently carried by the soldiers can be considerably reduced. A cable energy storage device developed can also be beneficial for storing energy for clean-energy technologies such as wind and solar. This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project fills the gap of a cable-type capacitor which saves space and fits well with electrical and electronic devices. The objective of this proposal is to use nanotechnology-based fabrication techniques to grow nanowhiskers with a high surface area on a copper cable to make cable-type capacitors. These nanostructures considerably enhance the surface area necessary for the storage of electrical charges. Since nanostructures are developed only on the outside of the electrical cable to store energy, the inner part of the cable can still be used for electrical transmission. The focus of the proposed research is to develop the processes which can be used to make these nanostructured electrodes into a cable capacitor. The fabrication techniques for growing nanostructures will be so designed that making long lengths of the cables are feasible. The performance of the cable-based capacitors will be tested in terms of capacitance, cycle life, voltage output, etc. In addition, the flexibility of the cable will be tested at different bend-angles to evaluate its applications in flexible energy storage applications.\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project will be to develop engineered bacteria with the ability to oxidize the copper mineral chalcopyrite and gold. The majority of copper reserves are in chalcopyrite, which currently requires smelting. The US copper mining industry, due to regulatory restrictions, has a limited smelting capacity forcing US copper manufacturers to ship copper mineral concentrates overseas for smelting, which incurs additional transportation and processing costs while losing up to 30% of the full value of the metal to the smelters. At over 400,000 tons of copper concentrate exported annually, this amounts to over $600M in lost value. In gold mining, biooxidation is increasingly used before other gold recovery techniques are utilized, and increased oxidation rates would expand the use and significantly lower the capital and operating costs of this practice. In addition, enhanced oxidation would accelerate the development of mining waste streams as biotechnology feedstocks. This project potentially furthers more economical and sustainable biohydrometallurgical techniques throughout the mining industry. This STTR Phase I project proposes the demonstration and development of new oxidation activity within bioleaching microbes, expanding the applications of biohydrometallurgy in metal mining. This would permit the application of cheaper, low impact biohydrometallurgical methods for important metal minerals. Currently, biohydrometallurgy is limited by its reliance on ferric iron as the main oxidant. The Intellectual Merit of this proposal stems from the use of hydrogen peroxide, which can enable mineral oxidation conversions and rates that are not obtainable with ferric iron alone. Adding hydrogen peroxide to biohydrometallurgy operations is not feasible or cost effective, however, the genetic engineering of biomining microbes, such as A. ferrooxidans, to produce hydrogen peroxide would be a potentially game changing advance. This innovation will result in the production of biomining microbial cells with an unprecedented ability to dissolve sulfide-rich ores leading to the expansion of biohydrometallurgical approaches in the mining industry."},{"type":"HTML","data":"<div class=\"result-alert alert-warning\" role=\"alert\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"close\" data-dismiss=\"alert\" aria-label=\"Close\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\">&times;</span></button><strong>Output is truncated</strong> to 102400 bytes.
