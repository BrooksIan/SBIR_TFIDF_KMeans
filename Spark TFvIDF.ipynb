      "|Purpose: This project team will fully develop and test Woot Math Polls, a formative assessment dashboard that converts student math work into data-driven insights to inform teacher instruction and student learning in middle and high school algebra classrooms. Research has marked a decline in math achievement around the time students take algebra in middle school. Technological innovations that produce immediate information teachers and students can use to facilitate dialogue and analysis of complex topics offer potential for improving understanding and learning.\n",

      "Project Activities: During Phase I in 2017, the team developed a prototype of a dashboard that generates information on student work during algebra class. At the end of Phase I, researchers completed a pilot study with 254 students and nine teachers across grade 8 and 9 classrooms. They found that the prototype operated as intended, teachers were able to understand and use results, and students were engaged during classroom dialogue around the insights on their work. In Phase II, the team will fully develop the user interface for students and teachers, a tool to create and share Open Educational Resources (OERs), and materials to support classroom implementation. After development is complete, the researchers will carry out a pilot study to examine the usability and feasibility, fidelity of implementation, and the promise of the dashboard to inform teacher instruction and improve student learning. Participants in the study will include 20 Algebra I mathematics classrooms in 10 schools, and the students enrolled in those classrooms, with one classroom per school randomly assigned to use Woot Math as well as the dashboard and the other half assigned to a business-as-usual control. Researchers will compare student scores on pre and post algebra learning outcomes aligned to Common Core standards.\n",

      "Product: In prior research and development, the project team developed Woot Math, a technology delivered intervention with interactive games and activities for algebra learning. In this project, the team will develop Woot Math Polls, a formative assessment dashboard to convert student work into data-driven insights to promote dialogue and discussion of complex algebra topics between teachers and students. The dashboard will work across all web-enabled devices, including laptops, tablets, smartphones, smart boards, and projectors. The dashboard will include a teacher tool to create, customize, share, and remix materials as OERs, which teachers will share with other teachers using the dashboard. The intervention in coordination with the dashboard will support student outcomes for Common Core standards in algebra.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |[purpose: this project team will fully develop and test woot math polls, a formative assessment dashboard that converts student math work into data-driven insights to inform teacher instruction and student learning in middle and high school algebra classrooms. research has marked a decline in math achievement around the time students take algebra in middle school. technological innovations that produce immediate information teachers and students can use to facilitate dialogue and analysis of complex topics offer potential for improving understanding and learning.\n",

      "Project Activities: With Phase I funding in 2017, the team developed a Storyworld prototype that presented teachers with a dashboard that displayed results from a reading comprehension activity completed by 30 EL students in grade 1 and 2. At the end of Phase I, researchers completed a pilot study with three teachers. They found that the prototype operated as intended, and that teachers were able to review reports and use the findings to guide face-to-face instruction with students. In Phase II, the team will fully develop the user interfaces beyond reading data, to include listening, speaking, and writing data, and materials to support teacher use of data to guide instruction. After development is complete, the team will carry out a pilot study to examine the usability and feasibility, fidelity of implementation, and the promise of the dashboard to inform teacher insights and guide instruction, and improve EL student&apos;s language proficiency. Thirty-six Kindergarten to grade 2 classes with 10 students per class will participate in the pilot study. Half of the classes will be randomly assigned to use Storyworld and the dashboard and the other half assigned to a business-as-usual control. The researchers will compare student pre to post learning using a standardized measure of English language acquisition, the Language Assessment Scales.\n",

      "|Purpose: This project team will fully develop and test Fate and Fortune, an online class-wide intervention where grade 8 students learn algebra within a story-based game. Research demonstrates that students who do not succeed in algebra are more likely to eventually drop out of high school. When students begin Algebra I, a lack of conceptually meaning and understanding can be further reinforced by curricula where math problems do not make sense in the context of their lives and interests.\n",

      "Project Activities: During Phase I in 2017, the team developed a prototype including the core game mechanics for students to engage in the adventure backstory and initial problem sets. At the end of Phase I, researchers completed a pilot study with 35 students and three teachers in three grade 8 classrooms. They found that the prototype operated as intended, students were engaged, reported that the activities were fun, made them curious to learn more, and helped to connect math to their lives. In Phase II, the team will develop a fully-functional user interface, interactivity across student users, narrative scripts and accompanying art assets, problem sets, and student and teacher dashboards and databases. After development is complete, the research team will carry out a pilot study to examine the usability and feasibility, fidelity of implementation, and the promise of the game to improve learning. Eight grade 8 mathematics classrooms in four schools will participate in the study, with one classroom per school randomly assigned to use the game and the other half assigned to a business-as-usual control. The team will compare student scores on pre and post Algebra I learning outcomes aligned to Common Core standards.\n",

      "Product: Fate and Fortune is a multi-player game-based intervention for grade 8 mathematics classrooms. The game is designed for use at the beginning of Algebra I, to address core concepts that provide a foundation for student success throughout the remainder of the course. Set in the Spice Trade of the 1600s, in Fate and Fortune students design ships while managing their own Renaissance-era shipping company where they travel around the world to purchase and sell spices. Rather than focusing solely on number calculations, the game employs a story-based narrative where mathematical thinking occurs naturally as students create, build, and solve problems to support understanding of algebraic logic and structure. As a multi-player game, students will interact with other classmates to complete trades that lead to encounters with different math problems. The game design architecture will work desktops and tablets and will include supplemental print materials. A dashboard will provide teachers immediate feedback on student progress to guide responses to individual learners and the collective classroom.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |[purpose: this project team will fully develop and test fate and fortune, an online class-wide intervention where grade 8 students learn algebra within a story-based game. research demonstrates that students who do not succeed in algebra are more likely to eventually drop out of high school. when students begin algebra i, a lack of conceptually meaning and understanding can be further reinforced by curricula where math problems do not make sense in the context of their lives and interests.\n",

      "Project Activities: During Phase I in 2017, the team developed a prototype dashboard that presents data from experiments where sensors measured the scientific properties of altitude, speed, and temperature. Researchers worked with three middle school science teachers and 350 students to determine that the prototype operated as intended. Teachers reported that students engaged in productive scientific conversations as they worked on their lab reports using the prototype. Most students reported that they would be interested in completing more science investigations using this method. In Phase II of the project, the team will fully develop the back-end data system to present results, a portal to provide access to user generated, lessons, lab templates, and coding activities across participating classrooms. After development concludes, researchers will conduct a pilot study to assess the feasibility and usability, fidelity of implementation, and the promise of CloudLab for improving student learning. The team will collect data from 30 middle school teachers and students in these classes, with half of the classes randomly assigned to use the CloudLab and the other half to use business as usual laboratory activities to teach the same course content. Researchers will compare pre-and-post scores of student&apos;s learning NGSS outcomes associated to the experiments, as well as scores on student motivation to conduct scientific experiments.\n",

      "Project Activities: During Phase I in 2017, the project team developed a prototype of ClassCoach, including a user interface, an information management system for housing and organizing data, and the reporting engine for generating reports The team completed a pilot study with 89 administrators, and they found that 97% of the administrators reported that the prototype functioned as intended and was easy to use to track student behaviors. More than 50% used the dashboard to identify teachers who needed additional guidance in providing students behavioral supports. In Phase II, the team will fully develop the dashboard&apos;s architecture to host diverse sources of data, a filter to sort and analyze data by relevant school characteristics and needs, and a portal with recommendations teachers can use to support improvements in students&apos; behavior. After development is complete, the research team will conduct a pilot study to assess the feasibility and usability, fidelity of implementation, and the promise of the dashboard for supporting administrators in tracking student behavior and providing resources teachers can use to meet the behavioral needs of students. Participants in the pilot study will include administrators from 100 schools, half of whom will use the platform and half will use LiveSchool without the new component. Researchers will investigate whether the dashboard increases the ability of administrators to track student behavior, and provide teachers resources to manage and improve student behavior relative to the comparison condition.\n",

      "|Purpose: This project team will fully develop and test Mission US TimeSnap, a game integrated within a Virtual Reality (VR) headset. This VR environment will provide an immersive exploration and analysis of events in U.S. history. In the most recent National Assessment of Educational Progress, only 17% of grade 8 students performed at or above the proficient level in U.S. history. The discipline of history goes beyond knowing what happened in the past; students must investigate why significant events occurred and form interpretations based on skilled readings of historical sources, and Mission US TimeSnap will provide students the opportunity to develop both investigative and interpretative skills.\n",

      "Project Activities: During Phase I in 2017, the team developed a prototype of TimeSnap, including a VR environment where students immerse themselves in content related to the history of the Revolutionary War. At the end of Phase I, researchers completed a pilot study with 58 students in grades 9 and 11 and two teachers. They found that the hardware VR and software-based prototype operated as intended, teachers were able to integrate it within the classroom environment, and students were engaged while using the prototype. In Phase II, the team will add content modules and a gameplay narrative to the platform, build the dashboards to present results, strengthen the back-end management system, create the professional development materials, and build out the classroom activities to accompany the VR experience. After development is complete, the research team will conduct a pilot study to assess the feasibility and usability, fidelity of implementation, and the promise of the TimeSnap for improving student learning in history. Ten high school history classrooms will participate in the pilot study, with half randomly assigned to use TimeSnap and half to follow business-as-usual instructional practices. Researchers will compare students&apos; pre-and-post scores on learning historical facts, and their ability to investigate and analyze historical events using research developed measures.\n",

      "Product: This project team will develop TimeSnap, a game-based virtual reality (VR) game designed to immerse high school students in U.S. history. In the game, students travel back in time to investigate and explore historical locations, encounter people from the past, analyze artifacts, and bring back evidence to support interpretations of what happened. Each VR experience lasts about 15 minutes and is preceded and followed by classroom discussions and activities. The components of the intervention will include: a VR headset with content from the Revolutionary War in colonial Boston, the years leading up to the Civil War, the period of Western expansion, and 1900s New York; a classroom guide with briefs that provide teachers with full instruction and materials for classroom implementation; and teacher and student dashboards to track progress and a website with professional development videos. TimeSnap intends to increase students&apos; knowledge of U.S. history, their interest and enthusiasm for studying history, and their historical thinking skills.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |[purpose: this project team will fully develop and test mission us timesnap, a game integrated within a virtual reality (vr) headset. this vr environment will provide an immersive exploration and analysis of events in u.s. history. in the most recent national assessment of educational progress, only 17% of grade 8 students performed at or above the proficient level in u.s. history. the discipline of history goes beyond knowing what happened in the past; students must investigate why significant events occurred and form interpretations based on skilled readings of historical sources, and mission us timesnap will provide students the opportunity to develop both investigative and interpretative skills.\n",

      "project activities: during phase i in 2017, the team developed a prototype of timesnap, including a vr environment where students immerse themselves in content related to the history of the revolutionary war. at the end of phase i, researchers completed a pilot study with 58 students in grades 9 and 11 and two teachers. they found that the hardware vr and software-based prototype operated as intended, teachers were able to integrate it within the classroom environment, and students were engaged while using the prototype. in phase ii, the team will add content modules and a gameplay narrative to the platform, build the dashboards to present results, strengthen the back-end management system, create the professional development materials, and build out the classroom activities to accompany the vr experience. after development is complete, the research team will conduct a pilot study to assess the feasibility and usability, fidelity of implementation, and the promise of the timesnap for improving student learning in history. ten high school history classrooms will participate in the pilot study, with half randomly assigned to use timesnap and half to follow business-as-usual instructional practices. researchers will compare students&apos; pre-and-post scores on learning historical facts, and their ability to investigate and analyze historical events using research developed measures.\n",

      "In this project, researchers will develop a prototype of a web-based tool through which English Learners (EL) can practice conversation with an automated avatar. The Speaking and Listening Learning System will provide support, feedback, and will adapt to the conversational level of students. At the end of Phase I, in a pilot study with 20 EL students in grades 1 and 2, the researchers will examine whether the prototype functions as planned, if students are able to converse with the avatar, and if the prototype shows initial promise for improving outcomes for language acquisition.\n",

      "in this project, researchers will develop a prototype of a web-based tool through which english learners (el) can practice conversation with an automated avatar. the speaking and listening learning system will provide support, feedback, and will adapt to the conversational level of students. at the end of phase i, in a pilot study with 20 el students in grades 1 and 2, the researchers will examine whether the prototype functions as planned, if students are able to converse with the avatar, and if the prototype shows initial promise for improving outcomes for language acquisition.\n"
