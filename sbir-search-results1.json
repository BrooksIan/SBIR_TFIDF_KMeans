        "abstract": "Purpose: This project team will fully develop and test Woot Math Polls, a formative assessment dashboard that converts student math work into data-driven insights to inform teacher instruction and student learning in middle and high school algebra classrooms. Research has marked a decline in math achievement around the time students take algebra in middle school. Technological innovations that produce immediate information teachers and students can use to facilitate dialogue and analysis of complex topics offer potential for improving understanding and learning.\n\nProject Activities: During Phase I in 2017, the team developed a prototype of a dashboard that generates information on student work during algebra class. At the end of Phase I, researchers completed a pilot study with 254 students and nine teachers across grade 8 and 9 classrooms. They found that the prototype operated as intended, teachers were able to understand and use results, and students were engaged during classroom dialogue around the insights on their work. In Phase II, the team will fully develop the user interface for students and teachers, a tool to create and share Open Educational Resources (OERs), and materials to support classroom implementation. After development is complete, the researchers will carry out a pilot study to examine the usability and feasibility, fidelity of implementation, and the promise of the dashboard to inform teacher instruction and improve student learning. Participants in the study will include 20 Algebra I mathematics classrooms in 10 schools, and the students enrolled in those classrooms, with one classroom per school randomly assigned to use Woot Math as well as the dashboard and the other half assigned to a business-as-usual control. Researchers will compare student scores on pre and post algebra learning outcomes aligned to Common Core standards.\n\nProduct: In prior research and development, the project team developed Woot Math, a technology delivered intervention with interactive games and activities for algebra learning. In this project, the team will develop Woot Math Polls, a formative assessment dashboard to convert student work into data-driven insights to promote dialogue and discussion of complex algebra topics between teachers and students. The dashboard will work across all web-enabled devices, including laptops, tablets, smartphones, smart boards, and projectors. The dashboard will include a teacher tool to create, customize, share, and remix materials as OERs, which teachers will share with other teachers using the dashboard. The intervention in coordination with the dashboard will support student outcomes for Common Core standards in algebra."

In this project, the team will fully develop and test a formative assessment dashboard that provides teachers with insights into EL student&apos;s progress as they use Storyworld. ELs are the fastest-growing student population in U.S. schools, with reports showing that nearly 1 in 10 public school students are ELs and approximately three in four U.S. classrooms include at least one EL. Many teachers remain unprepared for the challenge of helping ELs master both the English language and academic content.\n\nProject Activities: With Phase I funding in 2017, the team developed a Storyworld prototype that presented teachers with a dashboard that displayed results from a reading comprehension activity completed by 30 EL students in grade 1 and 2. At the end of Phase I, researchers completed a pilot study with three teachers. They found that the prototype operated as intended, and that teachers were able to review reports and use the findings to guide face-to-face instruction with students. In Phase II, the team will fully develop the user interfaces beyond reading data, to include listening, speaking, and writing data, and materials to support teacher use of data to guide instruction. After development is complete, the team will carry out a pilot study to examine the usability and feasibility, fidelity of implementation, and the promise of the dashboard to inform teacher insights and guide instruction, and improve EL student&apos;s language proficiency. Thirty-six Kindergarten to grade 2 classes with 10 students per class will participate in the pilot study. Half of the classes will be randomly assigned to use Storyworld and the dashboard and the other half assigned to a business-as-usual control. The researchers will compare student pre to post learning using a standardized measure of English language acquisition, the Language Assessment Scales.\n\nProduct: The research team will develop a formative assessment dashboard to present data to teachers on ELs performance after using Storyworld, a web-based product with mini-games to supports language acquisition through activities done simultaneously in the student&apos;s native language (e.g., Spanish and Mandarin) and in the target language (e.g., English). Reports will inform teachers of K-2 ELs&apos; progress in across reading, listening, speaking, and writing, and provide recommendations for supporting instruction. The dashboard will present results in the student&apos;s native language and in the English, show individual trajectories, and provide class-wide growth patterns."

        "abstract": "Purpose: This project team will fully develop and test Fate and Fortune, an online class-wide intervention where grade 8 students learn algebra within a story-based game. Research demonstrates that students who do not succeed in algebra are more likely to eventually drop out of high school. When students begin Algebra I, a lack of conceptually meaning and understanding can be further reinforced by curricula where math problems do not make sense in the context of their lives and interests.\n\nProject Activities: During Phase I in 2017, the team developed a prototype including the core game mechanics for students to engage in the adventure backstory and initial problem sets. At the end of Phase I, researchers completed a pilot study with 35 students and three teachers in three grade 8 classrooms. They found that the prototype operated as intended, students were engaged, reported that the activities were fun, made them curious to learn more, and helped to connect math to their lives. In Phase II, the team will develop a fully-functional user interface, interactivity across student users, narrative scripts and accompanying art assets, problem sets, and student and teacher dashboards and databases. After development is complete, the research team will carry out a pilot study to examine the usability and feasibility, fidelity of implementation, and the promise of the game to improve learning. Eight grade 8 mathematics classrooms in four schools will participate in the study, with one classroom per school randomly assigned to use the game and the other half assigned to a business-as-usual control. The team will compare student scores on pre and post Algebra I learning outcomes aligned to Common Core standards.\n\nProduct: Fate and Fortune is a multi-player game-based intervention for grade 8 mathematics classrooms. The game is designed for use at the beginning of Algebra I, to address core concepts that provide a foundation for student success throughout the remainder of the course. Set in the Spice Trade of the 1600s, in Fate and Fortune students design ships while managing their own Renaissance-era shipping company where they travel around the world to purchase and sell spices. Rather than focusing solely on number calculations, the game employs a story-based narrative where mathematical thinking occurs naturally as students create, build, and solve problems to support understanding of algebraic logic and structure. As a multi-player game, students will interact with other classmates to complete trades that lead to encounters with different math problems. The game design architecture will work desktops and tablets and will include supplemental print materials. A dashboard will provide teachers immediate feedback on student progress to guide responses to individual learners and the collective classroom."

The Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) emphasize the actual doing of STEM so that students can apply learning to the real world. However, students often have difficulty collecting, measuring, and applying data from inquiry activities to furthering their ideas, skills, and knowledge of STEM.\n\nProject Activities: During Phase I in 2017, the team developed a prototype dashboard that presents data from experiments where sensors measured the scientific properties of altitude, speed, and temperature. Researchers worked with three middle school science teachers and 350 students to determine that the prototype operated as intended. Teachers reported that students engaged in productive scientific conversations as they worked on their lab reports using the prototype. Most students reported that they would be interested in completing more science investigations using this method. In Phase II of the project, the team will fully develop the back-end data system to present results, a portal to provide access to user generated, lessons, lab templates, and coding activities across participating classrooms. After development concludes, researchers will conduct a pilot study to assess the feasibility and usability, fidelity of implementation, and the promise of CloudLab for improving student learning. The team will collect data from 30 middle school teachers and students in these classes, with half of the classes randomly assigned to use the CloudLab and the other half to use business as usual laboratory activities to teach the same course content. Researchers will compare pre-and-post scores of student&apos;s learning NGSS outcomes associated to the experiments, as well as scores on student motivation to conduct scientific experiments.\n\nProduct: CloudLab will be a web-based dashboard that presents data captured by sensors on scientific properties such as altitude, speed, and temperature. CloudLab will work with the existing PocketLab sensor, a small wireless device that transmits scientific data using Bluetooth to a smartphone, tablet, or computer. CloudLab will consist of a portal for middle school science students, so that they can record and store data from their individual experiments, analyze, and present findings to classmates and as course assignments. CloudLab will include a portal for teachers to manage lab groups, to aggregate results at the class and individual student level, and to share or find content on lessons, lab templates, and coding activities. CloudLab will be used by students in and out of classrooms to supplement learning of course content aligned to NGSS topics in physics, chemistry, biology, Earth science, engineering, design, and technology."

        "abstract": "Purpose: This project team will fully develop and test Mission US TimeSnap, a game integrated within a Virtual Reality (VR) headset. This VR environment will provide an immersive exploration and analysis of events in U.S. history. In the most recent National Assessment of Educational Progress, only 17% of grade 8 students performed at or above the proficient level in U.S. history. The discipline of history goes beyond knowing what happened in the past; students must investigate why significant events occurred and form interpretations based on skilled readings of historical sources, and Mission US TimeSnap will provide students the opportunity to develop both investigative and interpretative skills.\n\nProject Activities: During Phase I in 2017, the team developed a prototype of TimeSnap, including a VR environment where students immerse themselves in content related to the history of the Revolutionary War. At the end of Phase I, researchers completed a pilot study with 58 students in grades 9 and 11 and two teachers. They found that the hardware VR and software-based prototype operated as intended, teachers were able to integrate it within the classroom environment, and students were engaged while using the prototype. In Phase II, the team will add content modules and a gameplay narrative to the platform, build the dashboards to present results, strengthen the back-end management system, create the professional development materials, and build out the classroom activities to accompany the VR experience. After development is complete, the research team will conduct a pilot study to assess the feasibility and usability, fidelity of implementation, and the promise of the TimeSnap for improving student learning in history. Ten high school history classrooms will participate in the pilot study, with half randomly assigned to use TimeSnap and half to follow business-as-usual instructional practices. Researchers will compare students&apos; pre-and-post scores on learning historical facts, and their ability to investigate and analyze historical events using research developed measures.\n\nProduct: This project team will develop TimeSnap, a game-based virtual reality (VR) game designed to immerse high school students in U.S. history. In the game, students travel back in time to investigate and explore historical locations, encounter people from the past, analyze artifacts, and bring back evidence to support interpretations of what happened. Each VR experience lasts about 15 minutes and is preceded and followed by classroom discussions and activities. The components of the intervention will include: a VR headset with content from the Revolutionary War in colonial Boston, the years leading up to the Civil War, the period of Western expansion, and 1900s New York; a classroom guide with briefs that provide teachers with full instruction and materials for classroom implementation; and teacher and student dashboards to track progress and a website with professional development videos. TimeSnap intends to increase students&apos; knowledge of U.S. history, their interest and enthusiasm for studying history, and their historical thinking skills."

        "abstract": "No other group of diseases encompasses a greater pathophysiology than do the rheumatic diseases \nSpanning multiple organ systems  clinical decisions often rely on coordinated efforts from primary care\nproviders and rheumatologists to rule in or rule out differential diagnoses when treating inflammatory conditions\nsuch as rheumatoid arthritis  RA  and systemic lupus erythematosus  SLE   RA is a symmetric  inflammatory \nperipheral polyarthritis leading to deformity of joints via erosion of bone and surrounding cartilage  SLE can\naffect virtually any organ leading to fatigue  fever  myalgia  weight change and complications associated with\nrenal  central nervous system  and hematologic systems can be life threatening  RA and SLE are diagnosed\nthrough clinical judgment after excluding alternative diagnoses  In the case of both diseases  individual\nlaboratory tests are effective only in a portion of the disease population  In RA  testing for rheumatoid factor\nand anti CCP antibodies provide very important information when positive  However  these two analytes\nremain negative in      of patients and continue to be negative throughout diagnostic follow up in     of\npatients with RA  Further  erythrocyte sedimentation rates  ESR  and c reactive protein  CRP  levels are\ngenerally strongly correlated with radiographic findings of joint damage  These measurements  however  can\nbe elevated by other infectious and inflammatory processes that are not specific for RA or can be altered  in\nthe case of ESR  by acute phase reactants from malignancy  tissue injury  or trauma  In SLE  exclusion of\nmarkers diagnostic for RA coupled with presence of markers measuring antinuclear antibodies  ANA  and\nfollowed by assays measuring double stranded DNA  dsDNA   anti Sm  anti Ro SSA  anti La SSB  anti U \nRNP  or antiribosomal P are frequently used  Across these analyses  the sensitivity and specificity for these\nlaboratory measurements vary greatly and many have high specificity to rule in SLE but lack sensitivity as\nthese diagnostic markers can be found in other disorders  For instance  anti Ro anti La are found in Sjogrenandapos s\nsyndrome and anti U  RNP is frequently associated with mixed connective tissue disease  As a physician\ncolleague pointed out   it is difficult to diagnose a negative   Thus  diagnostic approaches for both RA and SLE\noften rely on multiple  independent laboratory tests combined with clinical observation  Distinguishing between\nthese diseases is important  as the treatment procedures for these diseases are different  Time is a frequent\nfactor in the diagnosis of these diseases and tools are needed to facilitate earlier diagnosis as treatment for\nautoimmune diseases are highly effective and early initiation of therapy leads to the best outcomes \nMisdiagnosis of these conditions is also not uncommon \n Another common disease seen by rheumatologists is fibromyalgia syndrome  FMS   FMS is a common\ncause of widespread musculoskeletal pain that affects tendons  ligaments  and muscle  FMS is difficult to\ndiagnose and treat and a critical clinical point is that FMS is not explained by another rheumatic or systemic\ndisorder  Thus  FMS is a diagnosis of exclusion once other etiologies have been considered and excluded  RA\nand SLE are two diseases that must be eliminated from the differential diagnosis  Given the complicated\ndiagnostic process these patients are often forced to endure  recent studies have also suggested that\nhealthcare dollars are saved post diagnosis and patient outcomes improve  To date  there is no laboratory test\nthat can determine presence or absence of these three conditions from a single blood sample \n The question of whether or not disease classifiers capable of providing clinically useful information could be\nbuilt based upon disease specific expression levels of mRNAs in whole blood has been a subject of research\nfor greater than ten years  Many disease specific gene expression signatures have been identified in the\nresearch lab  A few of these have even progressed into commercially viable diagnostic tests  notably for\nsystemic sclerosis \n Long non coding RNAs  lncRNA  are recently discovered regulatory RNA molecules that do not code for\nproteins but influence a vast array of biological processes  In vertebrates  the number of lncRNA genes greatly\nexceeds the number of protein coding genes  It is also thought that lncRNAs drive greater biologic complexity\nbetween vertebrates and invertebrates  These lncRNAs also show much greater cell type specific expression\npatterns than mRNAs  Humans also develop many more complex diseases than other organisms  As such \nour data presented in preliminary studies  support the notion that disease associated lncRNAs exhibit far\ngreater differences in expression than disease associated mRNAs  In this application  we propose to explore\nthe hypothesis that lncRNAs are better biomarkers of human disease than mRNAs  Here  we will focus on\nFMS and rheumatic diseases as disease categories and have identified FMS and rheumatic disease \nassociated differentially expressed lncRNAs  Study of lncRNAs in human autoimmune disease is in its infancy\nand exploration of lncRNAs as biomarkers of autoimmune disease has not been previously addressed  We\npropose the following specific aim  To identify annotated and novel lncRNAs differentially expressed among\nCTRL  FMS  RA  and SLE and assess their function as biomarkers to distinguish FMS  RA  and SLE subjects\nfrom healthy subjects and subjects with other rheumatic diseases Diagnosis of fibromyalgia syndrome and other rheumatic diseases can be a difficult  long and costly process\nand misdiagnosis of these diseases is not uncommon  Long non coding RNAs  lncRNA  are a new class of\nregulatory RNA molecules that exhibit high degrees of cell type specific expression  The hypothesis we will\ntest in this application is that measurement of expression of disease specific lncRNAs in rheumatic diseases\nand fibromyalgia syndrome will have greater utility to provide meaningful clinical information to health care\nproviders faced with these diagnostic dilemmas than measurement of disease specific mRNAs"

Institute  Professional American women andamp  those from all developed nations increasingly delay childbearing for several years compared to the past because of career advancement and increasing social acceptability  This problem is not solely a woman s health issue but equally affects men as only     of infertility is attributable solely to women  while an estimated equal     is attributable to the male partner who also contributes to another     of combined female andamp  male causes \nCurrently  recombinant  r  human  h  follicle stimulating hormone  FSH  is the single largest therapeutic component of the infertility market with sales considerably in excess of $  billion per year  of which        of that total over $    Million per year in the much higher priced and growing US market and another     in the European market  Several infertility consultants to the Trophogen PIs have confirmed that rhFSH therapy for infertility is much too expensive for most American women as the cost is not covered by insurance in many states and  even if covered  there are often prohibitive out of pocket costs  In addition  the results with current rhFSH treatments are far from optimal with only an average response rate of        per cycle  and much worse for women over     especially for greatly under reported  poor responders   The latter include both to conventional first line in vivo FSH stimulation performed with intrauterine insemination  IUI  as well as to more effective but costly and invasive in vitro fertilization  IVF   Poor responders often produce fewer than   oocytes per superovulation cycle of variable quality and may require repeated cycles up to   or more to achieve a full term pregnancy  if they are successful at all  with devastating emotional and financial cost to infertile couples  Moreover  rhFSH stimulation is an important component of many rapidly growing additional markets limited only by cost  elective and medical egg banking  ethical

chromosomic aberrations  all known monogenic diseases and even proclivity to complex genetic and epigenetic diseases the latter using newest metabolomics techniques \nTo be most effective in disease prevention  all such methods also require an improved rhFSH analog to produce the largest possible number of high quality IVF embryos of which only   and in the future only   will be transferred to

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this project will be to help control nutrient contaminants in soil and water for the benefit of the world?s population, by providing sustainable access to safe drinking water. The estimated national economic cost of nitrogen pollution in drinking water is $19 billion annually, while the cost to freshwater ecosystems is $78 billion per year. Traditional water-quality monitoring practices are based on &quot;grab-samples&quot; that are sent for laboratory analyses that may take days to weeks to be completed. Similar traditional approaches are found in agriculture where excessive application of nitrate-based fertilizers may result in agricultural runoff that carries pollution to ground and surface water sources. The proposed high-performance, low-cost optical sensor technology will enable deployment of a dense real-time monitoring network in freshwater sources, water treatment facilities, and farms, and will gain a significant foothold in the $6.8B global water quality monitoring equipment market. In the event of natural disasters, integration of the proposed nitrate sensor will be useful in assessment of water quality in local water resources, providing communities with real-time information on water safety. This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project focuses on the development of a non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) detector for real-time monitoring of nitrate concentration in water. This effort will combine nitrate-selective ion-exchange membrane technology with today&apos;s low-cost infrared (IR) components for the design of a new type of sensor targeting applications in aqueous environment. The proposed technology relies on infrared optical fibers for signal transmission. Currently, the use of commercial real-time optical nitrate sensors, based on ultra-violet (UV) absorption, is limited due to the optical interferences in the UV spectra related to the inorganic and organic substances, and reduced UV transmission caused by turbidity. The proposed proprietary IR technology is designed to overcome these shortcomings through implementation of smart membrane filtering. The instrument will provide high frequency data collection in dynamic aqueous environments with a wide sensitivity range (1 to 100 ppm). This technology can be further expanded for measurement of additional nutrients and contaminants, making it a robust tool for water quality assessment."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this project is the rapid, cost-effective detection of natural gas leakage to improve public safety, mitigate global climate change, and decrease product loss. Natural gas is the largest provider of power in the United States. However, more than 80 Tg of leakage occurs at well pads and pipelines during production alone. Such leakage poses a public health risk, with 1300 significant incidents reported from 1997 ? 2016, resulting in 50 fatalities, 180 injuries, and $2B in costs. Additionally, methane is a greenhouse gas with a warming potential that is 84 times higher than CO2. In 2015, natural gas leakage accounted for 198 million tons of CO2 equivalents, corresponding to a carbon tax value of more than $2B. Finally, energy companies want to reduce leakage to avoid product loss, with 80 Tg of methane having a value of $12B. This project will directly impact the aforementioned areas by improving the efficiencies and costs associated with natural gas leak detection. With over 2.2 million miles of local utility gas distribution pipelines 1.2 million well pads in the U.S. alone, the commercial prospects for an improved natural gas leak detection system are very promising with expected revenues exceeding $70M. This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will involve the development of a comprehensive natural gas leakage detection solution that integrates compact, low-cost sensors with state-of-the-art analytics. The solution, which can be used in drone-based and handheld monitoring, will enable energy providers to detect natural gas leakage from well pads and pipelines. In Phase I, technical feasibility will be demonstrated by the development of a lightweight gas sensor based on incoherent, cavity-enhanced spectrometry and a natural gas camera based on filtered infrared imaging. These sensors will be integrated with global positioning system, wind speed\/direction, and data analytics platform. The Phase I solution will be laboratory tested to characterize its analytical performance, before undergoing field testing on controlled natural gas leaks. In Phase II, the sensor hardware, electronics, and firmware will be refined to meet the stringent size, weight, power, and environmental constraints of drone-based and handheld deployment. Likewise, the analytics platform will be refined to incorporate the STTR sensors, interpret the infrared camera data, and provide comprehensive leak detection reports. The Phase II prototypes will be field tested under real-world conditions with a variety of potential customers for both well pad monitoring and pipeline distribution system monitoring."

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase 1 project is aimed at providing technology to address the high costs of developing effective and safe drugs. Bringing a new drug to market typically involves screening 100?s of thousands of compounds for efficacy and toxicity utilizing cell, tissue and animal models to ultimately select a lead compound that will be tested in clinical trials. This process can take years, billions of dollars, and in the worse case leads to compounds that fail during clinical trials due to safety concerns. Advances in microfluidics and 3D-printing have enabled the construction of tissue culture devices with nearly unlimited numbers of tissue chambers and flow channel complexity. Combined with optical sensors with unprecedented sensitivity, instrumentation can be built that maintain large numbers of biopsied tissue samples, while assessing the effects of exposure of the tissue to libraries of drugs. This technological platform provides resolution of drug effects on human tissue with high sensitivity thereby reducing the cost of animal testing and the risk of bringing toxic drugs to clinical trials and the market. In addition, the technology will impact the fields of personalized medicine, where drugs could be tested on an individual?s own tumor or tissue, and environmental health. Measuring in vitro cellular responses to pharmaceutical compounds is critical for identifying toxic effects of candidate drugs prior to costly in vivo animal and clinical testing. To address this need, instrumentation to maintain and assess biopsied tissue in real time is being developed. The technology utilizes microfluidics for optimal maintenance of tissue viability and function, and optoelectronics to measure oxygen uptake with unprecedented sensitivity. The fluidics are driven by gas pressure, circumventing the need for unwieldy pumps, and the channels are fabricated by 3D printing, allowing for nearly unlimited numbers of chambers and flow channel complexity. The technological platform will aid in the selection of lead compounds for clinical trials, estimation of doses for first-in-human tests, and support applications to the FDA. In this Phase 1 SBIR proposal we will build 2 96-channel turnkey instruments for a contract research program and for beta testing by pharmaceutical companies. The functionality of a low-capacity (8-channel) system has been previously demonstrated. The funding will support scaling up the throughput of the system as well as enabling additional modes of operation. The instrumentation will be used for contract research and for direct sales to the large market of drug discovery within the pharmaceutical industry."

        "abstract": "This STTR Phase I project will remove the most critical roadblock to making long-lasting batteries from safe and economical zinc and air. Zinc is plentiful in the U.S. and zinc-air batteries have the potential to hold more than five times the energy of current lithium-ion batteries, but a key challenge for making rechargeable zinc-air batteries is that the zinc inside the battery naturally forms sharp needles called dendrites during recharging. Over time these dendrites can grow large enough to damage the inner workings of the battery, reducing efficiency and lifetime. This project will borrow principles from an adjacent field, the electroplating industry, to create new organic chemicals that will seek out and stop dendrite growth within the battery during recharging. Chemical additives have a long history in electroplating for controlling the shape of metal surfaces, and the same principles can apply to additives designed here to control zinc growth during battery recharging. This new technology will make zinc-air batteries cheaper and longer-lasting to eventually replace existing battery technologies, enabling longer-distance electric vehicles, reducing equipment weight for soldiers, contributing a valuable technology to the economy, and helping to maintain the role of the U.S. as a leader in energy storage technology. This STTR Phase I project will identify the critical chemistry necessary to elegantly and economically suppress zinc dendrite formation, alleviating one of the most significant challenges complicating the full commercial emergence of Zn-Air battery technology. Eschewing the established tactic of applying existing chemicals from the catalog, this project will take inspiration from the PI?s experience designing additives for similar environments in the electroplating industry to introduce novel proprietary organic chemistry addressing the dendrite bottleneck directly. The key technical challenge will be to optimize the molecular features to simultaneously provide efficient dendrite suppression and low voltage loss. A broad series of molecules will be created to combine strong interactions with zinc, modest polarization, low cost and straightforward scalability. Evaluating and iterating upon these candidates in bench-scale electrochemical analyses and performance tests in coin and pouch cell batteries will yield a dendrite-suppressing product to bring significant value to Zn-Air technology and other Zn-based battery markets. At its successful conclusion, this project will not only produce products for these markets, but it will also provide molecular design principles useful for the development of other metal-based battery additives, and promote the merits of novel additive development for the broader battery industry."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is in automating the process of unbiased stereology, the state-of-the-method used in the life sciences for counting stained cells on tissue sections. Unbiased stereology allows neuroscientists to accurately analyze the size and number of brain cells, which are altered in many neurological disorders and mental illnesses. For reasons that are currently unknown, Alzheimer&apos;s disease, Parkinson&apos;s disease and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis are all associated with a progressive loss of brain cells. In contrast, children with autism are born with too many brain cells, which leads to life-long problems in processing complex streams of information. Stereology plays an important role in investigating many conditions affecting the brain and assessing the efficacy and safety of possible treatments. Though the proposed technology will initially target research studies to understand and treat all neurological conditions, it can be useful for automatic assessments of cells in all tissues, including cancer screening and diagnosis from biopsies. The proposed project will develop and optimize an algorithm to help brain scientists identify causes and treatments for neurological disease and mental illness. The proposed technology will use deep learning (artificial intelligence) systems to automatically recognize, count and size brain cells on tissue sections. An important use of this technology will be to analyze brains and nerve tissue from mice and rats treated to show similar neurological diseases as those found in humans. These animal models provide a powerful tool for testing treatments to cure brain disease in humans. Currently stereology studies of tissues from these animals require a trained technician to sit before a computer screen making tedious manual counts of hundreds and thousands of microscopic cells. This outdated approach fails to take advantage of powerful deep learning methods proposed for the proposed software that could complete these tasks 10 times faster and with fewer errors and human biases. Therefore, the proposed technology will use deep learning technology to accelerate basic research and drug development in the U.S., thereby establishing a long-term economic engine and bringing significant benefits to society through scientific breakthroughs and medical discoveries."

        "abstract": "This STTR Phase I project will undertake the development of iron coordination complexes as alternatives for gadolinium contrast agents which are currently used in clinical MRI diagnostic exams. New MRI contrast agents are needed to serve the segment of the population who cannot tolerate Gd(III) agents. This includes patients with kidney disease and those who have frequent MRI scans and may accumulate Gd(III). The proposed research involves the study of new trivalent iron coordination complexes based on those initially studied in the co-PI?s university laboratory. New iron complexes will be prepared and studied as contrast agents in live mice to improve characteristics of the agents such as clearance from the body. Fundamental studies of the iron complexes will add to the body of knowledge on the paramagnetic properties of iron. For the most promising Fe(III) contrast agents, the synthetic procedures will be adapted for large scale preparation and purity determination. Iron MRI contrast agents may also be beneficial to society by reducing gadolinium in water supply. Furthermore, iron as an abundant element is less expensive and more readily available in the USA than is gadolinium. The commercialization of iron MRI contrast agents will create jobs in chemical manufacturing, sales, and in health-related occupations. The lead Fe(III) coordination complex on which this project is based produces longitudinal (T1) relaxivity of water protons that rival clinically used Gd(III) complexes at 4.7 Tesla, both under in vitro conditions and also in live mice. Importantly, these complexes contain macrocyclic ligands that stabilize iron in the trivalent state (negative redox potentials versus NHE) and do not produce reactive oxygen species even in the presence of ascorbate as a reductant and peroxide. The importance of outersphere water and innersphere water interactions will be studied by varying the coordinating pendent groups on the macrocyclic ligand which is bound to Fe(III). The ancillary group will be varied to increase binding to serum proteins and to modify the clearance route of the contrast agents either through kidneys or through hepatobiliary routes. The complexes will be optimized for kinetic inertness towards release of iron under biologically relevant conditions. Toxicity studies in cell culture will be carried out on each of the new complexes. This research will focus on both pilot scale preparation for the study of the Fe(III) complexes in vitro and also on larger scale preparations and HPLC analysis of the most promising new derivatives. In vivo MRI scans in mice on a 4.7 T scanner will be used to track the distribution and clearance of the iron contrast agents as a function of time."

This is expected to be achieved through the development of a steerable needle that can reach arbitrary positions in the human body that are not reachable by a straight needle from a simple needle hole. The long term impact of the proposed technology is in targeted delivery of medicine, or the removal of tissue such as biopsies, or treatment mechanisms such as ablation devices. An overarching goal of the proposed project is the availability of minimally invasive procedures that can replace more drastic surgery options. The development of this device has the potential to also save lives, treating what otherwise would be inoperable conditions due to the location of tumors blocked by sensitive organs or bones. The proposed project, if successful, will lead to demonstrating the application of a device that utilizes the buckling behavior of semi-curved beams to controllably alter the stiffness in a needle for cancer treatment and measure its efficacy in terms of the advantages over straight needles. The objectives of this research include: developing a prototype and match to surgeon use cases (interventional radiologist) and testing and characterizing the steerability performance while delivering the medical payload. Specifically, it is expected that the first therapeutic application of this technology will be microwave ablation of cancer tumors."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this project is the first time commercial development of a copper cable which can transmit and store energy. Currently, copper cables are used for transmitting electricity. Adding energy storage capability to these cables is transformative and has the potential to be employed in a myriad of electrical and electronic applications. Making these cables into spools of wires and custom sliced into a certain length to achieve a required capacitance will be very attractive to commercial applications. The proposed study enables to understand how energy transmission and storage can be simultaneously performed without mutual interference. These cables can find niche applications in the automotive, energy, defense, and IT industries. Moreover, when made into thin wires, it can be weaved into a matrix which can be used to charge wearable devices. For example, currently, a soldier carries about 30-40 pounds of battery for a three-day mission. However, if energy storage devices like the one proposed here can be made into an advanced textile form and can be worn as a uniform, the weight currently carried by the soldiers can be considerably reduced. A cable energy storage device developed can also be beneficial for storing energy for clean-energy technologies such as wind and solar. This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project fills the gap of a cable-type capacitor which saves space and fits well with electrical and electronic devices. The objective of this proposal is to use nanotechnology-based fabrication techniques to grow nanowhiskers with a high surface area on a copper cable to make cable-type capacitors. These nanostructures considerably enhance the surface area necessary for the storage of electrical charges. Since nanostructures are developed only on the outside of the electrical cable to store energy, the inner part of the cable can still be used for electrical transmission. The focus of the proposed research is to develop the processes which can be used to make these nanostructured electrodes into a cable capacitor. The fabrication techniques for growing nanostructures will be so designed that making long lengths of the cables are feasible. The performance of the cable-based capacitors will be tested in terms of capacitance, cycle life, voltage output, etc. In addition, the flexibility of the cable will be tested at different bend-angles to evaluate its applications in flexible energy storage applications."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project will be to develop engineered bacteria with the ability to oxidize the copper mineral chalcopyrite and gold. The majority of copper reserves are in chalcopyrite, which currently requires smelting. The US copper mining industry, due to regulatory restrictions, has a limited smelting capacity forcing US copper manufacturers to ship copper mineral concentrates overseas for smelting, which incurs additional transportation and processing costs while losing up to 30% of the full value of the metal to the smelters. At over 400,000 tons of copper concentrate exported annually, this amounts to over $600M in lost value. In gold mining, biooxidation is increasingly used before other gold recovery techniques are utilized, and increased oxidation rates would expand the use and significantly lower the capital and operating costs of this practice. In addition, enhanced oxidation would accelerate the development of mining waste streams as biotechnology feedstocks. This project potentially furthers more economical and sustainable biohydrometallurgical techniques throughout the mining industry. This STTR Phase I project proposes the demonstration and development of new oxidation activity within bioleaching microbes, expanding the applications of biohydrometallurgy in metal mining. This would permit the application of cheaper, low impact biohydrometallurgical methods for important metal minerals. Currently, biohydrometallurgy is limited by its reliance on ferric iron as the main oxidant. The Intellectual Merit of this proposal stems from the use of hydrogen peroxide, which can enable mineral oxidation conversions and rates that are not obtainable with ferric iron alone. Adding hydrogen peroxide to biohydrometallurgy operations is not feasible or cost effective, however, the genetic engineering of biomining microbes, such as A. ferrooxidans, to produce hydrogen peroxide would be a potentially game changing advance. This innovation will result in the production of biomining microbial cells with an unprecedented ability to dissolve sulfide-rich ores leading to the expansion of biohydrometallurgical approaches in the mining industry."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project will be a cost-effective, commercially viable, alternative process for on-site treatment of food waste and energy recovery. In the U.S., nearly 40% of food is wasted with $165 billion equivalent loss of food plus associated water, energy, chemicals, and labor used in food production. Disposal of the food waste involves additional costs and causes environmental pollution, e.g. rotting food waste in landfills accounts for a large portion of U.S. methane emissions, a powerful greenhouse gas. Moreover, food waste streams contain a substantial amount of chemical energy that also is lost by its disposal. Recovering energy in food waste in the form of biofuel and chemicals, as proposed in this project, will provide efficient management of food waste problem reducing food waste disposal costs while producing useful products. This STTR Phase I project proposes to develop and demonstrate the performance of a novel, immobilized clostridia cell membrane bioreactor-based continuous process to convert food waste to butanol. The conventional stirred-tank fermentation reactor-based food waste conversion process exhibits low butanol concentration as well as productivity. The proposed process will address the technical barriers of the conventional process by immobilizing the clostridia cells on porous media to dramatically increase cell culture density, and, consequently, butanol productivity and conversion efficiency. In addition, by separating butanol from the reaction media, recycled butanol concentration is minimized in the reactor, which alleviates butanol toxicity. The membrane fouling issues in biomass separation will be addressed by an &quot;open channel&quot; membrane module design to separate and recycle biomass to the bioreactor. The energy requirement for recovery of butanol from dilute reactor effluent will be reduced by an order of magnitude over the conventional distillation by using a pervaporation membrane. The objective of the proposed effort is to demonstrate a steady state continuous integrated process for converting food waste to butanol after optimizing individual components."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will result from a direct benefit to the energy sector of the U.S. economy, since seismic exploration will play an increasingly important role in meeting increasing energy demands and maintaining healthy oil and gas output. The goal of this project is to develop a software package for automated pattern recognition that can be used by seismic processing companies to automatically pick geological features from seismic data. Seismic data volumes have grown exponentially over the last three decades as the seismic exploration industry increases its survey coverage. Manual picking and geological pattern identification jobs, which depend on visual inspection, are labor intensive and cannot keep up with the growth in data generated by seismic surveys. In this project, the company will develop a machine vision enabled picking and identification tool trained by a deep learning network. Lessons learned in training an efficient deep learning network for pattern recognition have wide applications in other areas such as medical image analysis. This project will support the training of both graduate and undergraduate students in the areas of seismic exploration, machine learning and high-performance computing. This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project aims to develop a deep learning network model to recognize unique patterns embedded in seismic data, which patterns are characteristic of the associated geological structures. Specifically, the project will demonstrate the feasibility of delivering a machine vision enabled inspection tool to relieve domain experts from labor-intensive visual examination activities. Various automatic picking approaches currently exist, with differing degrees of success. Nonetheless, the uncertainty involved in these tools is still too high for them to be widely adopted by the industry. Recent advances in the area of deep learning make it possible to surpass human-level visual recognition performance in some applications. High performance deep learning network models, however, require a large amount of high quality training data. In this project, the company proposes to use a novel self-taught deep transfer learning approach to overcome the data shortage problem resulting from proprietary rights associated with the data. The new training workflow is adaptive to the domain of seismic data processing. It will also minimize the training effort and deliver a robust system with guaranteed performance for new and unseen datasets."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this project is to develop smart software to plan and control Electric Vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure in commercial facilities, such as workplaces, hotels, car rental centers, parking garages, etc. The EV planning software finds the optimal design balancing design tradeoffs such as EV customer satisfaction, grid stability limits and financial constraints. This software will help facility operators to optimize their EV charging infrastructure by minimizing their operating costs and maximizing their revenue by utilizing intelligent scheduling and pricing strategies. The software leverages the latest developments in stochastic optimization for designing an optimal configuration of EV infrastructure that is robust to variations in mobility behavior of the users. This will enable public utilities to save billions of dollars by deferring expensive upgrades to their existing infrastructure. It will also empower small consulting businesses, facility managers and electrical contractors to design and build EV infrastructure without any specialized knowledge of optimization or modeling. This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project addresses the problem of planning and controlling EV charging infrastructure to meet the rapidly growing energy demands of EV owners. EVs are expected to comprise 30% of all cars globally by 2030. This forecasted increase over the next 10 years is of major concern for utilities, and commercial real estate owners. Given the long commute distances, driving habits, time taken to charge using home-based chargers and range anxiety, there is a need for charging locations at workplaces, hotels, and car rental centers. Chargers at these locations will generally be medium power Level 2 chargers, which are 5 to 10 times the size of typical home chargers. Simultaneous uncontrolled charging of several EVs at these locations will easily overload the local electrical infrastructure. The software mitigates this problem by designing an optimal EV infrastructure together with optimally sized onsite generation and storage. The controlling solution ensures that the grid impacts are minimized by scheduling the installed EV chargers together with onsite generation and storage with optimal set points in real time."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to improve the way educators and therapists teach social skills to children who are on the autism spectrum (as well as those affected by other social skills disorders) and deliver cost efficiencies that could expand access to such support across diverse socioeconomic classes and geographical regions. These advances have potential to produce meaningful quality-of-life improvements for these children in areas such as employability, educational attainment, and personal relationships. Given that there are ~900K children on the spectrum in the US alone, and that the rate of diagnosis has been rising in recent years, the technology has significant potential for impact. It also has significant commercial potential: the US special education and therapy market is estimated at over 8 billion dollars, and feedback from therapists and educators has indicated significant commercial demand for a product like this. In addition, by pushing the frontiers of video game-based training by incorporating real-time eye tracking data, the proposed project will expand scientific and technological understanding of how video games can be used to shape human behavior. The proposed project involves furthering the development and evaluation of a video game designed to help children on the autism spectrum improve their social skills?a significant and growing need. Key development activities include (1) adding multiple types of gaze-controlled social skill training exercises, namely those targeting emotion recognition and joint attention; (2) incorporating a low-cost, consumer-grade eye tracker; (3) building an automated feedback system to ensure proper player positioning relative to the eye tracker; and (4) refining adaptive algorithms to personalize game difficulty and maximize engagement. These features will be designed and implemented by a diverse team with expertise in video game development, autism research, and technology commercialization. Evaluation will consist of tracking performance against quantitatively measurable success metrics related to game playability and engagement via human subject research across 10 participants (50 gameplay sessions). The expected result is a video game that addresses multiple social skill deficits, engages the target demographic, and can be deployed by therapists, educators, and parents in a cost-effective manner."

Specifically, this project focuses on a unique class of materials based upon a thermoset that displays high strength-to-weight ratio and exceptional fracture toughness. A challenge to broader adoption of these materials stems from the current reliance on metal-based reagents and catalysts for their production. The metals impose a significant recurring cost of production, show sensitivity to air, and remain as contaminants in the final products. This innovation provides the first metal-free access to such materials. Additionally, the unique metal-free catalyst system is capable of producing resin and polymer feedstocks that are not available from metal-based reagents, and may offer advantages in processing and performance. The projected commercial impacts of the innovation will be enhanced material performance, lower cost products, and broadened (new) fields of use. The existing market is estimated to be $578M with 4.9% annual growth through 2023. The intellectual merit of this project is the invention and development of the first metal-free route to olefin metathesis polymers and oligomers. Prior art has demonstrated on small scale the ability to use a unique organocatalyst to produce polymer and resin feedstocks that are easily processable into high performance thermosets and composites. The organocatalyst approach is a divergence from all previous methods of producing materials via olefin metathesis and therefore warrants validation and optimization toward commercial scale-up. The Phase I research aims will include (1) scale-up through the design and implementation of flow reactor technologies, (2) mechanical analyses and product specification sheets for thermoset prototypes, and (3) evaluation of new resins and polymers for use in fiber reinforced composite materials. The results should be useful commercially and academically."

        "abstract": "This STTR Phase I project will develop 3D printed liquid hydrogen fuel tanks for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). UAVs are currently powered by long endurance low reliability gasoline engines, or short endurance highly reliable electric propulsion. Hydrogen fuel cells offer the potential for long endurance highly reliable propulsion if the proper hydrogen storage method is used. Through the innovative hydrogen storage system developed by this project, fuel cell electric vehicles can advance national health and welfare through reduction of emissions, and promotion of energy independence both on the ground and in the air. This project will develop a new class of liquid hydrogen storage tanks for electric UAVs that will increase the reliability and performance of surveillance platforms in the armed forces, reducing risk to American service personnel while they secure the defense of our nation. The same electric platforms will promote the national welfare by enabling the inspection of key energy and transportation infrastructure and serving as intelligence and communications platforms for first responders during natural disasters. In addition, the key technology developed in this project will expand the utility of additive manufacturing by demonstrating the capabilities and performance of engineered plastics in cryogenic (&lt; -238\u00b0F) environments. Such cryogenic rated 3D printed polymer parts have wide ranging impacts, including cost reduction, across cryogenic dependent technology areas from medical devices and spacecraft to drug and food processing. Additively manufactured polymers have never been used in cryogenic applications until now. The correct selection of polymer blend, testing and selection of a lightweight impermeable membrane, and thermal characterization of novel insulation materials are critical to project success. Since most cryogenic research, such as -423\u00b0F permeation of hydrogen through polymers, has not been studied since the 1960s, extensive cryogenic engineering and testing experience is required to apply modern materials and manufacturing methods to the project. The objectives of this project will fill knowledge gaps by testing metallized polymer films for hydrogen permeability, as well as manufacturing methods to cost effectively apply it to insulation panels or tank walls. While prior research has identified a polymer blend that is robust to cryogenic thermal cycling, the possibility of microcracking has not yet been thoroughly addressed and will be evaluated in this project. Novel insulation materials never before used in commercial cryogenic applications will be thermally characterized and integrated into the prototype tank. This project will conclude by completing a liquid hydrogen fuel fill and measuring the mass boil-off rate to test computational fluid dynamic modeled performance."

        "abstract": "This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I Projects intends to promote academic achievement, high school graduation and college and life preparedness for adolescents (middle through college students) with Executive Function (EF) deficits. EF deficits are found in a variety of neurodevelopmental and medical disorders including Traumatic Brain Injury, Epilepsy, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), the most common childhood behavioral disorder affecting up to 10% of youth as well as Autism Spectrum Disorder. Youth with EF deficits struggle to get things done and have high school graduation, college matriculation and college graduation rates well below national norms. In addition, these adolescents suffer from anxiety, depression, job loss, substance use and suicide at higher rates than their peers without EF deficits. Research supports incentive-based behavioral EF remediation for deficient populations. But availability of research-based EF remediation support is limited. The proposed technology aims at enabling students to develop the EF skills needed to reach their academic potential and improve their life outcomes. The broader impact of this research is to gather rich data that will advance the scientific and public understanding of technology as a means of facilitating EF skills development in adolescent populations with Executive Function deficits. The proposed Phase I project aims to iteratively develop an app-based EF technological intervention using user-centered design principals. This technology innovation is in the form of a smart phone based app that uses gamification and automation to motivate students to make structured behavior change to learn the time and materials management, planning, organizational and motivation skills to get their work done with help of their support team. This Phase I project will focus on 3 Aims. First, we will assess users&apos; current context (EF remediation approaches and challenges) to validate user relevance of our approach and refine where necessary for optimal usability (Aim 1). We will then systematically evaluate the features, usability and feasibility of the technology intervention?and make additional software design revisions as needed to promote successful uptake (Aim 2). And we will develop a functional prototype of the app innovation (Aim 3) tailored to the $2.3 B Special Education software market."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project will be to develop a new tool to safely and nondestructively deliver genes and other materials into large numbers cells at the same time. New forms of therapies for cancer and other intractable diseases take advantage of a patient&apos;s own cells, re-engineered in the laboratory to target a tumor or other diseased tissue. However, generating these cells is currently inefficient, slow, and expensive. Patient-derived cells resist transfection using standard non-viral biochemical approaches of lipid delivery systems, cell-penetrating peptides, and high-voltage electroporation, requiring an engineering alternative. The proposed technology provides a safe, turnkey, and scalable technology with a potential transformative impact in research and life sciences laboratories and companies, representing a high-growth and high-value market opportunity. This STTR Phase I project proposes a new nanomaterial delivery system to introduce reprogramming agents into immune cells efficiently and with low cell toxicity. This project will examine how the proposed nanostraw design, transfection protocol, and cell preparation improves immune cell delivery efficiency, and optimize the process to achieve &gt;50% transfection efficiency with primary immune cells. Market analysis has found this level of transfection efficiency would be transformative to researchers and clinicians using primary immune cells. The transfection protocol will be optimized and codified into a simple to follow set of instructions. A turn-key instrument will be developed to carry out these procedures for use by life science researchers, with reduced device costs through improved manufacturing techniques to be competitive with currently available methods. The market-ready product will be evaluated by eight preclinical immune cell research beta sites to discover new treatment pathways. This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is the development of a digital skeletal evaluation workflow for reproductive toxicology studies that will better ensure that potential therapeutics with teratogenic effects will not make it to the marketplace, and at reduced time and cost. The current approach for characterizing the impact of new therapeutics and chemicals on skeletal development relies upon human-based qualitative characterization, while the goal for this digital and quantitative approach will be to more accurately characterize the effect of therapeutics. An improved skeletal characterization workflow in this $2.5 billion toxicology market also will allow for the reduced usage of animals. The imaging and characterization platform developed through this project will be commercialized as a service where contract research organizations or pharmaceutical companies may send fetal skeletons for analysis. Alternatively, customers may purchase the platform. This biphasic business model will allow small contract research organizations to outsource labor intensive characterization and large contract research organizations to switch to this new digital approach. This SBIR Phase I project proposes to optimize a prototype optical coherence tomography (CT) scanner for the 3D digitization of rodent skeletons at high resolution. Using this system, rodent skeletons will be transformed into three-dimensional data matrices that can be evaluated digitally by a fetal pathologist or characterized quantitively by a computer for defects. The illumination and imaging parameters of the optical scanner will be systematically optimized to reduce noise and to enable the clear differentiation between different skeletal features. Once rodent skeletons can be imaged in a reproducible manner to create three-dimensional data sets, these data sets will be compared quantitatively side-by-side to data sets acquired from the same animals using more expensive X-ray CT imaging. Following imaging optimization and validation, a digital analysis program will be developed that will determine if bones in a rodent model deviate from control samples. This program will begin to allow for the complete digital evaluation of rodent skeletons for developmental and reproductive toxicology studies."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this project lies in the widespread nature of the problem of airborne Black (BC) and Brown (BrC) carbon particulates. These are formed from combustion processes such as motor vehicles and ships, forest fires and biomass burning, as well as indoor cooking in developing countries. BC and BrC are important components of atmospheric aerosols (small airborne solid and liquid particles) that affect air quality, visibility and climate. The World Health Organization estimates that nearly 7 million premature deaths globally in 2012 were linked to air pollution, and black carbon-containing aerosols are often singled out as a major contributor due to their strong linkages to adverse health effects. Accurate and robust monitoring of BC (and BrC) at a lower cost is necessary in urban and industrial areas throughout the United States and abroad to provide adequate temporal and spatial measurements that can be used to assess regional air quality models and estimate community exposure risks. This information will then make it possible for local and regional government agencies to develop mitigation strategies that protect the health of their communities. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the problem of accurate and inexpensive Black Carbon (BC) measurements by developing a long-path photometer to quantify airborne BC and BrC particulates. The most common commercially-available technique for BC and BrC requires collection of particulates on a filter. This filter introduces numerous artefacts requiring complicated corrections. Other existing techniques are quite expensive and require significant expertise to operate. The Black Carbon Photometer (BCP) to be developed here will not require pre-concentration on a filter, thus providing a direct, correction-free measurement. It will be operationally simple and require little maintenance, similar to photometers routinely used in monitoring networks for gas phase species such as ozone. The initial BCP will be low power, portable and is projected to cost less than currently available BC analyzers. Thus, it should provide researchers in air quality and public health, as well as those in monitoring agencies, a practical and economical alternative to existing technologies."

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase I project will develop a new approach for Additive Manufacturing (AM) of objects made from ceramics, metals, and polymers. Developed a generation ago, AM had the potential to transform the design and manufacture of products. However, legacy AM approaches have failed primarily because of the high cost of inputs, and because output lacks precision, quality and durability. Our proposed approach has broad industry potential. The broader societal impact is to change the entire competitive stance of US manufacturing by revolutionizing industrial design and enhancing local manufacturing. This project has the potential to advance science and the prosperity of US manufacturing industries. Its commercial impact may span industries from product design to aerospace, space, defense, and human health. This SBIR Phase I project will demonstrate the integrated production of objects made from ceramics, metals, and polymers additively at room temperature from stock inputs such as rods and discs. Over 95% of metallic AM output today uses metallic powders as inputs. These inputs are costly, explosive, and harmful to human health if ingested. Furthermore, current AM output suffers from imprecision, poor quality, inconsistency, and lack of durability. Additionally, legacy Metallic AM platforms are large, expensive, operate at high temperatures, and are isolated from the engineers who rely on them. The key objectives of this project are (1) to demonstrate the feasibility of a room-temperature fabrication approach and (2) to achieve several crucial milestones involving the precision of location, thickness, strength, uniformity and reliability of AM output."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will serve two complementary unmet market needs by: (1) accelerating the evaporation rate of brine ponds and enhancing salt production efficiency by 2-3 times; (2) condensing the moisture evaporated from contaminated\/salty water so that one can obtain clean drinking water with n consumption of electricity. We will develop an enhanced solar vapor generation strategy based on a patent-pending electricity-free solar thermal technology. Specifically, we will develop\/optimize functional materials to enhance the solar-driven vapor generation rate. The target is to double or even triple the salt production of mining companies relying on evaporation of brine ponds exposed to natural sun and wind. We will work with selected industrial partners to perform the field test in lithium brine ponds, which is the key source material for future Lithium battery industry. In addition, by condensing the evaporated moisture, we will aim to produce clean water using low cost materials and systems, which is a promising and sustainable solution to address the global drinking water scarcity using affordable electricity-free products in coastal and resource-limited areas. The proposed project will aim to commercialize a patent-pending technology to realize an enhanced solar-driven water evaporator, which is highly desired for both solar mining production and clean water generation. Due to the superior solar energy absorption, heat conversion, and thermal insulating properties of our disclosed structure, most of the absorbed energy can be used to evaporate surface water with significantly reduced thermal dissipation. Remarkably, our pilot system has realized a record solar thermal conversion efficiency of &gt;88% under illumination of 1 kW\/m2 with no solar concentration. The corresponding vapor generation rate is ~1.28 kg\/m2\/h - a full 3X higher than the natural evaporation of bare water surfaces in the same environment. This Phase I SBIR effort will aim to overcome the remaining technical barriers for material and system optimization and scaling up strategies for manufacturing. By comparing the roll-to-roll coating and direct dying processes in this proposed research, we will select the best overall technology to complete our supply chain for the production in Phase II. In particular, we will perform field tests by working with solar mining industrial partners as well as Non-Government Organizations (NGO&apos;s) to get their feedback on how to improve the product in relevant environment."

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase I project aims to further the development a novel nanoparticle-based synthetic platelet technology for the treatment of internal, non-compressible hemorrhage after traumatic injury. Trauma is the leading killer of people aged 1-46, and uncontrollable hemorrhage after injury is the cause of 35% of pre-hospital trauma deaths and 90% of military combat casualties. This is because there are currently no pre-hospital treatment options for internal, non-compressible hemorrhage. If the patient reaches a medical treatment facility in time, the current standard of care is transfusion with blood products, including platelets. However, natural platelet products suffer from shortage in supply (due to donor shortage), difficulty in portability, high risk of bacterial contamination, very short shelf life (3-5 days), requirement of blood typing and cross matching, and multiple biologic side effects (e.g. immune response). Therefore, there exists a significant clinical need for a synthetic platelet surrogate that can address the above limitations and can be administered at point-of-injury or during en route care to stop the bleeding earlier and potentially save lives. Beyond the potential clinical and commercial impact, the proposed research will also provide multi-disciplinary educational and research opportunities in major STEM areas at undergraduate level to create future scientists and engineers. A synthetic platelet technology has been developed that can simulate the hemostatic mechanisms and capabilities of natural platelets while allowing large-scale manufacturing, sterilization, long shelf-life and portability. The technology consists of a platelet-mimetic lipid-based nanoparticle, heteromultivalently surface-decorated with three types of small synthetic peptide ligands that render cooperative mechanisms of binding to von Willebrand Factor (vWF) and collagen (platelet-mimetic injury site-selective adhesion mechanisms) and binding to stimulated form of GPIIb-IIIa on active platelets (platelet-mimetic injury site-directed aggregation mechanism). This patented design is unique in that it is currently the only design that combines these adhesion and aggregation properties of natural platelets on a single synthetic platform. Preliminary studies have established the platelet-mimetic functional mechanisms in vitro as well as its significant hemostatic therapy capability in vivo in small (mouse) and large (pig) animal models of hemorrhage in both prophylactic and emergency administration frameworks. Building on these promising results, this project aims to conduct translationally-directed studies to address technical hurdles associated with manufacturing the synthetic platelets with batch-to-batch consistency and long shelf life (&gt;1 year) at a range of storage conditions (widely varying temperatures, altitudes, etc), which would be highly relevant in austere civilian and military applications."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to deliver state of the art cryptography and cybersecurity solutions to Internet of Things (IoTs) and embedded device designers, enterprise hardware and software vendors, and government contractors against the attack of classical and quantum computers. It has been widely accepted that quantum computer attacks on today&apos;s security are expected to become a reality within the next decade. Some progress towards constructing quantum computers has been made, although no quantum computers with serious computing power have yet been built. Nevertheless, we believe it is prudent to plan ahead for future needs as it normally takes many years to change cryptosystem deployments due to network effects. This project plans to implement quantum-safe solutions which will require the integration of quantum-safe software and\/or hardware cryptographic solutions on resource-constrained devices used in embedded systems. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will design, develop, and implement cryptographic algorithms that are suitable for small and resource-constrained devices employing hard and complex mathematical assumptions known to be classical- and quantum-safe. All post-quantum cryptography candidates need to be evaluated in terms of performance while the target applications are resource-constrained devices. Long-term and lightweight security are two main parameters that need to be considered while deploying quantum-safe cryptographic algorithms in these devices. We plan to employ a special class of quantum-safe algorithms based on maps on elliptic curves to achieve the required performance and security. Cryptosystems based on these maps on the elliptic curves are known to provide the smallest possible key sizes and their security level is determined by a simple choice of a single parameter in comparison to the other quantum-safe candidates. The hardware designs are taken through VLSI design flow to realize the integrated circuits that are evaluated for energy\/power, area\/performance, and security. The project will generate new insights and results about how to be safe and secure in the quantum era. This project will also contribute to the ongoing standardization effort by the US government and other international organizations."

        "abstract": "The\u00a0broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to reduce the power consumption of display and lighting products by 90%. It will do so by enabling the pervasive use of light emitting diodes (LEDs) in such products. LEDs consume substantially less power than other display\/lighting technologies and also offer benefits such as superior picture or lighting quality and longer lifespan. The foremost barrier to the emergence of such products is the difficulty of economically placing large quantities of LEDs onto a product grid. For example, if current-day methods are used to create a full high definition display, its assembly would take about a month and drive its cost far beyond what the market could accept. This project&apos;s innovation addresses this problem with a laser-based, ultra-high speed LED placement solution. Beyond this immediate application, it will further the industry&apos;s technical capabilities relative to electronics component assembly in general. The commercial potential for chip-based LED display and lighting products is expected to reach about $10 billion within five years. The market for LED placement solutions in support of these products will be about $1 billion in this same time frame. The proposed project addresses the above problem by demonstrating an ultra-high speed LED placement method that can reduce the one month assembly time in the example above to just one minute. This solution, unlike others in development, increases the placement rate of LEDs by a factor of 10,000 and includes the ability to pre-screen and replace non-functional LEDs. This project will demonstrate the core aspect of this solution\u00a0involving the placement of multiple, very small LEDs (&quot;microLEDs&quot;) using a single laser pulse diffracted into multiple scanned beams. It will use this solution to demonstrate the extremely fast assembly of a quantum dot-based microLED display. The project will build upon a related, previously demonstrated capability applied to larger, silicon dies. Each aspect of the technology (wafer preparation, single laser beam placement, multi-beam placement) will be individually optimized for the new conditions imposed by the smaller sized, sapphire-based microLEDs. This new, LED-tailored capability will then be used to demonstrate the assembly of a four thousand pixel microLED display in under one second thereby achieving the project&apos;s goal of demonstrating a &gt;50M units\/hour LED placement rate."

Integration of embedded proximity sensors into robotic end-effectors with an advanced user-interface control system provides a significant leap from current sensory and control systems available. The advances of this project in sensing and control will expand the current boundaries which limit human interaction with the power of robots. The improvements to both control and sensing in collaborative robots will advance the use of robots in industrial, medical and household applications. Improved accuracy will expand robot use and significantly lower manufacturing costs in many advanced industries. Vast increases in robot safety with this project?s system will allow expanded human interaction including robot care for the needs of the growing senior population. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will advance our understanding of the role tactile sensation plays in robust manipulation and lead to novel means for in-gripper 3D sensing, complementing and in some cases replacing external 3D perception systems. Specifically, this project will demonstrate the role that proximity sensing and zero-force contact sensing play in grasp planning, object registration, and object recognition. A key challenge will be to merge information from two different sensor technologies that both excel in different range regimes, but have poor accuracy otherwise. The proposed covariance-based sensor fusion algorithms will be benchmarked by comparison with 3D models obtained from high-fidelity laser and 3D-scanning systems. A second challenge will be to abstract the resulting capability into easy-to-use programming environments for robotic grasp and manipulation planning, which will be tested with customers in the field."

FQHCs are funded by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to serve 22 million low income patients living in more than 10,000 of the poorest communities across the Nation. Well-implemented patient centered team-based care has the potential to significantly reduce physician shortages and burden of chronic disease which disproportionately affects low income communities. However, efforts to move and sustain FQHCs participation in this model have had limited success with only 66% attaining patient centered medical home (PCMH) recognition in 2016. Various public initiatives, including the Health Resources and Service Administration Quality Improvement Award and Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act (MACRA), are providing additional financial incentives to move primary care practices towards PCMH Recognition. However, current approaches to practice transformation are cumbersome and difficult to sustain. The proposed project seeks to disrupt continued health professional education at FQHCs by assessing the feasibility of developing a tool that leverages electronic health record data to identify gaps in patient centered team based care for diabetic patients and deploys tailored asynchronous individualized e-learning nudge type support to each member of the care team based on their performance. The research objectives of this SBIR Phase 1 are to establish the feasibility of using EHR data through an API to trigger individual user and team level flags for variation from a specific set of PCMH standards and diabetes clinical protocols; to develop algorithms that generate an individualized learner user profile and teams level reports; to generate data to design algorithms that learn from user preferences, impacts on flags and patient outcomes; to design user interphase for reward and recognition and to evaluate end user acceptance of eLearning tools. The research will be approached using user centric design, behavioral economics and adult learning principles to gather specific requirements and develop a minimum viable product focused on a subset of between five to 10 indicators."

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop an optical delivery system compatible with a transmission electron microscope (TEM) that will facilitate atomic-scale imaging and characterization at high-temperatures and excited states. The most critical and far-reaching broader impact of the proposed system is the new science\/discovery that it will enable. Imaging and characterization at the nano- and atomic-scale are critical to advancing new materials and technologies, which are in turn critical to research and industry laboratories. The instrumentation will enable researchers to uncover high-temperature and excited-state materials phenomena in unique temperature and temporal regimes previously inaccessible. The successful development of the proposed instrumentation will generate revenue and incubate several follow-on products, which in turn will create jobs. Year 5 will focus on both industry and research laboratories and market targets for both existing and new TEM sales. Conveniently, the system can be adapted for other materials characterization techniques to broaden the impact of the innovation. The intellectual merit of this project is the design, assembly, and testing of an optical delivery system specifically suitable for nano-and atomic-scale characterization in the TEM. The innovation delivers a system with unprecedented ability to manipulate materials in the TEM via the localized photothermal and photoexcited modalities. The photothermal modality will enable agile, non-invasive, and ubiquitous access to TEM specimens and enable unique temperature and temporal regimes not accessible with standard resistive heating systems. The excitation modality will enable researchers to image and characterize optical-excited states of materials at the nanoscale. The proposed instrumentation consists of dual fiber-coupled optical heating and excitation channels housed on a specially designed nanomanipulator for accurate x-y-z positioning. In addition to the hardware development, appropriate software controls will be developed for the optical sources and the nanomanipulator system. Finally, in-microscope testing of the in situ heating and excitation will be performed at the University of Tennessee. Specifically, three tasks are proposed for the in-microscope testing\/validation: (1) in situ high-temperature imaging, (2) photothermal adventitious carbon decontamination from graphene, and (3) in situ optical excitation of plasmonic nanoparticles during electron energy loss\/gain spectroscopy."

Within the manufacturing context?which represents 11% of US GDP [Bureau of Economic Analysis]?the collection and interpretation of this new set of large-scale time-and-motion data enables dramatic improvements in the understanding of assembly processes and optimization of human productivity. In addition, manufacturers can use this system to flag process errors or deviations?ideally in real time?allowing for mitigation before the deviations propagate further down the value chain. Just these two capabilities enable manufacturers to avoid costly rework and recalls, improve worker accuracy, discover new opportunities to optimize processes and generate revenue generation, and flag worker safety issues. As a result, workers and management become aligned around shared goals of efficiency and competitiveness?reducing fears of automation while dramatically improving productivity and possibly protecting jobs. This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will improve the robustness of a prototype deep learning back-end for automatic action recognition from a stream of video data. While object recognition is now commonplace, action detection?e.g., inferring the behavior and intentions of actors and objects over time?has not yet been solved or commercialized. In fact, it is still an active research area. Solving this problem requires overcoming technical hurdles in industrial settings that include changing actors, lighting conditions and camera perspectives; manual labelling of large volumes of video data; transmitting large volumes of data to and from the cloud; accurately inferencing with high levels of confidence; and developing intuitive human\/system interfaces that may, in the future, include unconventional channels such as AR\/VR, text-to-speech, haptic feedback, amongst others."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is a substantial reduction of leakage in high-density polyethylene (HDPE) pipes. HDPE is a type of plastic commonly used for water, oil, and gas distribution pipe systems. Billions of gallons of treated water are lost daily across the US due to leaking pipes, resulting in massive revenue loss, environmental and property damage, and energy waste. Furthermore, millions of metric tons of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, escape every year into the atmosphere through leaking pipes. Most leaks occur at pipe joints and by wirelessly monitoring each joint for leaks, as a part of a smart infrastructure network, major leak reduction can be achieved. The commercial impact of the project is extensive, as smart infrastructure networks are increasingly being implemented and expanded, sensor and wireless communication technology has advanced significantly in recent years, and the rate of piping infrastructure installations, replacements, and repairs are accelerating across the US and globally. The proposed project aims to demonstrate a prototype capable of detecting a leak in electrofusion joints and wirelessly communicate the leak to an external network. Such joint monitoring system is highly desirable as pipe leaks can go undetected for an extended period of time. Moreover, once detected, leaks can be difficult and expensive to locate, especially as pipes are commonly buried underground or situated at hard-to-reach or remote locations.\u00a0The challenge that comes with this\u00a0\u00a0is to provide a reliable local power source for the sensing unit that can be on standby for up to 50 years. A second challenge is to generate a signal, powered by the local power source, that can be transmitted to the surface and notify a leak to an external signal receiver. A water-activated battery combined with a radio-frequency identification (RFID) transmitter will be developed for this purpose. RFID technology is extensively used in a broad range of industries due to its low-cost and good\u00a0reliability\u00a0. This technology is, therefore, an excellent candidate for providing an affordable joint leak detection system."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in enabling additional energy savings in buildings by harvesting natural daylight and using it for illuminating the interior space with high efficiency and without glare, thus offsetting the need for electrical lighting. This will make building operations more sustainable and help improve the energy security of the U.S, create jobs, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, when commercially available, this new technology will bring all of the well-known benefits of enhanced natural lighting for occupants of millions of residential and commercial buildings across the U.S., such as connection to outdoors and improved comfort, productivity and well-being, thus benefiting many groups of consumers. The proposed project will demonstrate the feasibility of a novel, non-prismatic optical film material and its use for enhanced daylighting harvesting in buildings. This material employs thousands of microscopic reflective surfaces embedded into the bulk of the material and operates by capturing the incident sunlight and projecting it deep into the building interior. Commercial buildings alone consume about 20 percent of all energy used in the United States at an estimated cost of nearly $180 billion. Building interior lighting accounts for around 30% of that cost. By applying the daylight-harvesting optical material to windows of building facades, a significant fraction of that energy consumption can be offset using the natural light captured throughout the day. The project will provide the critical design, testing, and experimental validation needed to transition the technology into the commercial sector. The primary objective of the project is to develop the core light-redirecting material and associated micro-optical fabrication technology that can be subsequently scaled for low-cost mass production. A second objective is to develop, test and demonstrate a prototype daylight-harvesting window film product based on this material."

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase 1 project aims to develop a novel continuous rotational spiral solidification technology platform called Heliolithography (HL) to enable economical mass production of functional end-use 3D printed parts. The potential outcome of this feasibility study would be improving speed and performance of the prototypes to demonstrate key advantages of the process. This highly beneficial platform aims to advance 3D printing technology into production of functional parts. Its success would contribute to widespread job creation in the U.S. Manufacturing sector. Heliolithography utilizes continuous rotation to overcome the inefficiencies of a serial layer to layer process typical of stereolithography machines (SLA) that must reset, re-position, re-supply material so the next layer can be made. The rotating method serves as a continuous method to cure material, removes the adhesion force issue that impedes many SLA processes from scaling up, and resupplies new material to be cured in one motion. If successful, this will serve as a significant leap forward in the field that will provide greater throughput for mass producing and mass customizing 3D prints while allowing for the use of a broader range of advanced materials with higher viscosities. The research project will also focus on the development of an advanced non-stick coating and a tiled, high power, high resolution light engine. A tethered liquid interface nano-coating will be evaluated by bond line release and wear rate\/durability tests. The performance of the light engine will be validated through direct power output measurements and also through extended functional testing for dimensional accuracy, repeatability, and tensile &amp; impact strengths of the printed parts."

Lack of access to community resources such as housing, food and transportation (also known as social determinants of health) has been associated with negative health outcomes such as unplanned hospital readmissions and emergency room visits. This leads to high healthcare costs. Therefore, healthcare teams (i.e. social workers, case managers and discharge planners) spend a significant amount of time to locate appropriate community resources for their patients. Our innovation will leverage a community of healthcare professionals and the resource providers to ultimately find community resources for patients in a faster and less costly manner. The machine learning technology supported by this award will connect healthcare professionals with relevant community resources that ultimately reduces the cost and time associated with this process. A successful implementation of this technology will lead to improved post-treatment care outcomes for the patients and reduced cost of care. The proposed project will develop and test the feasibility of a web-based software platform to empower healthcare professionals to share community resources. Novel machine learning technology will be developed to facilitate appropriate and efficient exchange of community resources. Healthcare professionals using the platform will be able to get onto the platform as well as search and share resources. The machine learning algorithm leverages the relationships of healthcare professionals and resource providers to coordinate community resource sharing. A successful implementation of this algorithm will provide substantial improvements on the ability to acquire timely community resources as compared current methods. The goal of this research is to validate whether the machine learning technology is able to help healthcare professionals identify appropriate community resources."

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase I project will advance understanding of how game-based methods can be effectively used to help schools bring social emotional learning (SEL) instruction to all students. The end goal of this SBIR project is to create and test a game-based intelligent social tutoring system (ISTS) that both assesses and improves the behavioral readiness and social emotional (SE) skills of Kindergarten and 1st grade (K1) students. SEL is a critically important component of early education for all students, and efforts to bring SEL to the nation?s vulnerable early learners would be particularly impactful, especially in helping to foster equity in academic achievement. The proposed system will guide early learners to learn, and then practice SEL skills in controlled, engaging social simulations. This will provide schools with an easily administered, scalable tool to fill a niche for which there is considerable market pull. In addition to addressing significant societal and market needs, research findings from this SBIR will be used to more broadly inform the efforts of the game development community. As a first step in this R&amp;D effort, this SBIR Phase I project will (a) develop a game prototype consisting of six game-based scenes designed to assess essential SE skills linked in the literature to school readiness and positive behavioral functioning for young students (e.g., Emotion Regulation, Empathy, Impulse Control); (b) conduct game prototype test groups with K1 students to assess the usability and acceptability of the game as well as gather independent parent ratings and behavioral observations of children&apos;s SE skills; (c) develop prototype educator dashboard materials for administration of the SEL game with students, including resources to reinforce and extend SEL beyond the game; and (d) conduct a test of the game and dashboard prototypes with teachers and other educators who represent likely purchasers and\/or users of the product with students to assess the feasibility and potential value of the proposed product."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project achieves a widespread earthquake sensor network in the earthquake-prone regions. With this wide prevalence of the sensor network, this smart, real-time earthquake detection system can detect an earthquake within a second near an epicenter and notify the other users away from the epicenter before the shakings arrive, effectively creating an earthquake early warning system for society. This same infrastructure of the smart earthquake monitoring system can be transformed to detect other natural hazards such as landslides, volcano eruptions, mine explosions, generating larger social and economic benefits. With this technology, instead of some sparse seismic recordings that we have currently, we can collect dense earthquake data from tens of thousands of locations in cities, providing a block-by-block risk-assessment of earthquake hazards in cities. This dense data promises several orders of magnitude improvement in the current earthquake hazard maps and helps the first responders, catastrophic modelers, primary insurance and reinsurance companies, city planners, and building owners to better assess the earthquake hazard risks. The granular level of the risk maps has the potential to increase the awareness of earthquake hazard risk in society. The proposed project achieves a dense and hybrid seismic network using smartphones, tablets, and stationary IoT devices. A potential outcome of this project is a next-generation Earthquake Early Warning System with a sub-second response that repurposes smartphones, tablets, and other sensors of a large IoT ecosystem for the earthquake sensor network. To achieve the performance under a second, a new earthquake early warning system that scales the massive data streaming from multiple sources, enables sensor and server communication in the fraction of a second, finally builds a new push notification framework to alert hundreds of thousands in less than a second."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to enhance the capabilities of a research tool for companies, legal experts and researchers undertaking nationwide comparative policy analysis in the public health domain. The tool will assist experts in identifying relevant policy documents by determining and scoring the significance of statutory provisions in context of specific legal questions. The quantitative approach can enable novel policy tracking. Rather than experts setting up alerts for updates to a specific set of documents, this tool learns from the legal text used to answer legal questions to allow for real time tracking and discovery of updates and other relevant documents. This approach to policy tracking can present experts with timely information on updates, along with revealing new documents as they are introduced. Timely analysis can inform policy-makers, facilitating the crafting of optimized evidence-based public health legislation. Reducing the cost and effort of the most time-consuming aspects of legal research can make precise scientific policy analysis affordable and accessible commercially and in real time. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will decrease the time required to produce timely analysis of public health policy across 50 states. This research will apply machine learning, natural language processing and graph theory techniques to extract logical legal ontologies by computing similarities of public health provisions in statutory text. In domain specific problems, large sets of examples of annotated text are required. In the legal domain there is little available expert-labeled legal corpora and purposefully curating this kind of dataset is prohibitively expensive. To address this challenge, the proposed solution integrates transparently into legal experts&apos; workflow while generating ontology that mirrors the approach of a domain expert. The second challenge is that searching for patterns in the relations of a very large network of documents can be very expensive computationally. The proposed solution addresses this by extracting clues from the expert workflow to identify shortcuts that simplify and constrain the larger problem. These clues, combined with sparse expert labeled data can produce a more accurate baseline for optimization of scoring and similarity comparison of larger sets. By being integrated into more workflows, the transparent annotation process and algorithm could be applied to other policy domains."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will be to develop protein purification nanotechnology and materials for biopharmaceutical applications. Over 150 different protein or small peptide-based drugs have received FDA approval to treat an array of diseases (e.g., biologics, monoclonal antibodies, and blood clotting factors). Protein purification remains a challenge as the number of synthetic peptides entering clinical trials continues to grow. The global protein and peptide drug market is projected to exceed $140 billion in 2017 with an annual growth rate of ~5%. Demonstration of the feasibility of the proposed new protein purification resins is expected to provide a transformational tool for drug research and development, enhance research in protein\/peptide structure and function, and enable the discovery of new proteins\/peptides. This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop and commercialize new protein purification resins based on nanomaterials that will afford capacity independent of protein size, minimal metal leaching, and better stability with respect to existing immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) resins for protein purification. The new resins will ensure greater purity and activity of isolated proteins with control of epitope-tag specificity, and minimize non-specific interactions. The new resins will be compatible with current manufacturing processes and applicable in batch, microplate, sensor chip, and column formats. The goal is to demonstrate that the proposed technology is superior to existing commercial resins, as suggested by theoretical predictions and preliminary results. The new IMAC resins will be synthesized and characterized in terms of metal content and leaching, protein loading capacity, purity and activity of proteins isolated, and stability. These resins will be optimized for each mode of operation. The goal is to establish a new platform technology for analytic and preparative drug protein isolation."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this project is that it will enable the automated harvesting of fragile produce such as strawberries to help offset a shrinking workforce and increased labor costs. The world population is expected to grow from 7.3 billion to 11.2 billion by 2100, this population growth and a rising middle class will place more demand on the agricultural industry. Presently, the agricultural industry relies solely on manual labor to harvest its fragile produce. There is no mechanized option that can reliably and cost effectively harvest these crops. Consequently, the industry is struggling to harvest its crop, maintain quality and control its costs. High quality and lower costs can only be maintained if robotic harvesters are utilized that can pick fragile produce without damage. One of the key elements on the automated harvester is a gripper that can grab and pick the produce without damage. There is a market for a reliable and low cost robotic gripper that can gently pick and handle strawberries and other fragile produce. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project involves the development of a robotic end effector that can be used to harvest and handle fragile produce. Advances in machine vision and robotics has made it possible to commercially harvest fragile produce such as strawberries, however, the key component that still needs to be developed is an end effector that can pick the fruit without damage and be reliable and cost effective. Design and development of this end effector will use a new and novel method for grabbing the strawberry with advances in design, materials and actuation. The proposed R&amp;D plan will involve repeated testing of the interaction between the fruit and the end effector. Analytical studies using a series of thin film load sensors mounted on the end effector will provide real time load profiles that can be used to optimize the design and performance of the end effector. Shelf life testing of the fruit will be used to assess the success of the end effector in properly picking and handling the fruit without damage."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the need for non-invasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and hands-free control of technologies, including artificial and virtual reality (AR\/VR) and smart devices. The proposed multi-purposed BCI is expected to have immediate applications for several industries, including manufacturing and medicine. Currently, existing systems are either too expensive or limited for real-time control. The proposed BCI is specifically designed for 3 dimensional environments, and is intended to leverage multiple (&apos;hybrid&apos;) signals from the human body to allow increased performance using affordable hardware. It is also designed for and expected to allow AR\/VR control, which can enable productivity applications, as well as model BCI use in real-world scenarios. The long term goal is to enable users to scroll menus, select objects, and even type using their brain activity. The platform uses the existing form-factor of AR\/VR headsets to incorporate brain-sensing electrodes, and will be compatible with popular devices, independently or in parallel with their existing controllers. The electrodes are designed to be safe, non-invasive, and dry (requiring conductive gel or saline). The high-risk, high-reward research to be conducted under this project will significantly advance the applications of BCI systems in general, with an emphasis on AR\/VR technologies. The proposed project concerns a novel hybrid BCI by combining oculomotor and electroencephalography (EEG) signals via a custom machine learning platform. BCIs detect and interpret neural signals enabling control over a variety of technologies. However, current BCIs remain extremely limited in their applicability. They either require expensive equipment, invasive surgery, or have too low performance when using affordable noninvasive hardware. This BCI aims to provide real-time control in 3-dimensional scenarios, (e.g., AR\/VR\/real-world smart devices), while using affordable hardware. This SBIR Phase I project seeks to combine three distinct innovations: high-performance EEG signal analysis, high-speed eye movement classification, and custom multi-signal ensemble classification techniques. Specifically, the project seeks to use a custom machine learning and artificial intelligence approach informed by physiology to combine oculomotor and EEG signals to specifically enable3D AR\/VR control. The ultimate goal is to develop a high performance BCI system that affords flexible user control across hardware, software, and mobile applications."

The center piece of the innovation is the wide bandgap semiconductor betavoltaic power source, essentially an innovative nuclear-based micro-battery. The energy storage density of this power source is estimated to be three orders of magnitude greater than conventional NiMH battery technology. This power innovation will be combined with the very latest in ultra low power electronics and energy harvesting circuitry to realize sensors that are effectively self-powered for the useful life of device. The betavoltaic power source will enable the realization of the ?Internet-of-Things? vision by solving the power challenge, supporting the public good through enhanced safety and security, improved mobility and support for new and disruptive business ventures. The proposed project will attempt to solve a portion of the power challenge that today limits the implementation and scale of Internet of Things (IoT) solutions. Experts predict billions and possibly trillions of &quot;things&quot; connected by IoT technologies. This requires transformative advances in the science, technology, and engineering. The proposed betavoltaic power source will achieve advancements in all three areas, focused on the power challenge. Although research papers have been published on micro nuclear batteries, the power levels of the previous implementations are insufficient for broad market application. Through the use of novel fabrication techniques and optimal material selection and placement, the proposed power source will achieve at least an order of magnitude improvement in power efficiency over any previous result achieved, with target power efficiency level in excess of 30%. This surpasses the breakout power level required for mass adoption of the new power source. Work on this power source will result in new technology development for enhancing the efficiency of nuclear micro-battery. New semiconductor material processing and fabrication techniques related to the incorporation of radioactive materials will be developed as well as greater understanding of wide band gap semiconductor material behavior under irradiation as applied to radiation-hardened electronics."

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will result in the development of smart, self-healing nanocapsules as anticorrosive pigment additive for commercialization of sustainable, economical and metal free acrylic, epoxy or polyurethane based anticorrosive coatings. The nanocapsule additive based anticorrosive coating will meet and exceed the performance of solvent and heavy metals based coatings and disrupt the current technology paradigms by delivering a sustainable and efficient anticorrosive coating technology into the market. The cost to fix or replace corroded structures in the US alone is a staggering $500 Billions\/year that is compounded by the toxic environmental impact on account of the use of heavy metals such as, chromium, zinc and lead as anticorrosion pigments. This project will directly address these two important unmet industry needs. For example, the technology will replace heavy metals and deliver corrosion protection exactly when and where it is needed. This will increase the life-time of the coatings, decrease maintenance costs, and reduce the energy and labor costs. This novel technology is simple, scalable, and will find application across multiple industry sectors such as construction, oil &amp; gas, architecture, defense, aerospace etc. The intellectual merit of this project is the development of smart, self-healing, polymer based nanocapsules as pigment additives in anticorrosive coatings. Corrosion is an electrochemical process and is induced by corrosive ions in the environment. At the onset of corrosion, the electrochemical potential at the corroding site changes. Hence, in this project polymer based nanocapsules will be developed that will inhibit corrosion by multiple mechanisms. The nanocapsules themselves will prevent corrosion by acting as ionic barrier between metal and toxic ions as well as by anodic passivation. If the passivation or the barrier effect fails due to scratch or mechanical damage and the metal starts to corrode, the change in electrochemical potential on the corroding metal surface will activate the nanocapsules to release corrosion inhibitors encapsulated in the capsules at the corroding site. This phase I project will develop a method to synthesize smart, self-healing nanocapsules encapsulated with corrosion inhibitor. These nanocapsules will deliver a next-generation, water-based, acrylic, epoxy or polyurethane based anticorrosive coatings into the market."

High School STEM classrooms are centers of innovation for students. This product will provide the students a sand-box tool to develop their own control and data acquisition as well as train them in software that is widely used in the controls and data acquisition industry. The proposed project will develop a simulation and remote plant model intended to engage students in a new context and compliment STEM engineering curriculum in K-12 environments. The goals of the research are to understand the effect of simulation learning tools on STEM education, to develop a simulator for educational and workforce training purposes, and to develop a programming tool to enable student and maker applications of control and data acquisition systems that is currently lacking in that market. Simulation development technical hurdles include flow modeling in a wide-range of student defined configurations, equipment and filtration media. The simulation developed in this project will be further applied in the water and wastewater market to train plant operators for standard and emergency plant operation conditions. The web-accessible remote plant model component of the project requires connectivity of nationwide users to the remote plant and protection of the physical plant equipment. The development platform used for control of the plant will be available to the students for modification and use in their own projects.

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to produce polymer composites that enable commercialization of alkaline electrochemical devices, such fuel cells and electrolyzers. The use of fuel cell technologies will help preserve the environment, mitigate climate change, decreasing our carbon footprint and securing renewable energy supply. Electrolyzers are an increasingly attractive method of producing ultrapure hydrogen, an essential chemical feedstock and fuel. Currently, widespread adoption of these technologies is prevented by the high system costs, which are driven by the platinum catalysts. Operating under alkaline conditions with alkaline exchange membranes (AEMs) is necessary to relieve this pain point by allowing the use non-precious metal catalysts (e.g. stainless steel, nickel, cobalt, and their alloys). Moreover, AEMs will be less expensive to produce and recyclable at the end of lifetime, unlike the existing polymer electrolytes, further decreasing the cost of devices. Producing commercially viable AEMs enables the widespread deployment of fuel cell and electrolyzer systems by making the technology economically competitive with incumbent fossil fuel based energy sources. This SBIR Phase I project proposes to produce polymer electrolyte composites that meet the stringent performance criteria for a commercially viable AEM, including durability, hydroxide conductivity and mechanical strength under alkaline operating conditions. A proprietary polymer composition with unprecedented chemical stability will be incorporated into microporous polymer structural supports. Typically, cation percentage in AEMs must be kept low, otherwise the membranes swell excessively and deteriorate during operation. Incorporating polymers into structural supports permits increased cation concentration and ion exchange capacity (IEC), resulting in AEMs with high hydroxide conductivity. Furthermore, the mechanical strength of the composite is determined by the support and is not reduced by high IEC, like unsupported membranes. A polymerization method will be employed that allows fine control over cation concentration and the reaction can be conducted inside the support, simplifying composite fabrication. The combination of our unique polymer composition and a structural support that maximizes conductivity without losing mechanical strength, is a crucial milestone for the commercialization of our technology."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of an intuitive, easy-to-use, Smart Respiratory Health Management System for respiratory patients and their physicians. This system includes (1) lab-quality lung function data produced by the proposed mobile spirometer and paired smartphone application, (2) the interpretation and contextualization of this lung function data based on local environmental and physiological risk factors, and (3) the delivery of these insights to physicians and patients. By leveraging this software platform, this technology is expected to enable physicians to make timely interventions with their at-risk patients, thereby preventing acute respiratory exacerbations (e.g., asthma attacks) and any associated hospitalizations or visits to the emergency department. Currently, respiratory diseases are poorly managed, and the proposed predictive technology can help reduce the 1.6 million annual asthma-related visits to the emergency department. By enabling preventative patient interventions, the proposed technology is expected to reduce the high cost of asthma-related emergency department visits and hospitalizations. The proposed system-level solution will empower asthma patients to participate in their own health and treatment, while simultaneously improving health-related behaviors, patient-physician communication, and preventative care coordination. The proposed project focuses on the development of a software platform that connects chronic respiratory disease patients to physicians, to alert physicians of declining lung health. With this preemptive alert, physicians can intervene with patients before an acute respiratory exacerbation, thereby reducing hospitalizations and their associated costs. There are three steps required to implement this proposed system. The first is to facilitate the affordable collection of daily lab-quality lung function data. This step has already been completed via a mobile spirometer and pair smartphone application. The second step is to interpret and contextualize the collected data. This step requires the development of a predictive algorithm that incorporates risk factors from a physical activity and local environment. The third step is to deliver this data and their interpretation to the physician in a manner that is seamlessly incorporated into the existing electronic health records infrastructure and the physician&apos;s workflow. The second and third steps will be undertaken as part of this Phase I grant."

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase I project will develop a new technology for accurate, portable, and inexpensive measurement of multiple blood clotting tests. Such tests include prothrombin time \/ international normalized ratio (PT\/INR), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), activated clotting time (ACT), or thromboelastography (TEG) and are routinely performed on patients who suffer from conditions such as atrial fibrillation, deep vein thrombosis, or have had heart valve replacement. This affects millions of patients in the US alone for a market worth more than a billion dollars worldwide every year. However, many of the technologies currently used in the market cannot accurately or conveniently perform multiple blood clotting tests on the same system, causing clinically significant problems for patients and raising the cost and inconvenience of routinely performing these tests. The technology in this project fundamentally enables these various blood clotting tests to be performed in a single portable, test-strip system. This will potentially lead to less expensive, more accurate, and more convenient blood clot testing for medical professionals and millions of patients; improve medical care by bringing multiple blood clotting tests to a single portable device; bring much-needed innovation to a market which has relied on less accurate technologies; and foster small business and job growth in an emerging technology landscape that has the potential to address a billion dollar, worldwide market. The technology developed in this project will enable the first-of-its-kind implementation of a direct, mechanical test in a strip form, to more closely replicate the mechanical methods which fundamentally underlie all blood clotting time tests. As a mechanical measurement, the strip will measure physical properties of a finger-prick, whole blood sample to account for the confounding factors affecting point of care blood clotting tests, such as hematocrit for PT\/INR measurement. As a broad-spectrum hemostasis platform technology, other significant blood coagulation tests, which are based on measurement of fluid mechanical properties of the blood sample, can be brought to the portable point of care format including activated partial (aPTT) thromboplastin time (PT\/INR), activated clotting time (ACT), or thromboelastogram (TEG) testing. This Phase I project will demonstrate the feasibility of a second blood coagulation test (activated partial thromboplastin time), realizing a mechanical, strip-based, portable point-of-care (POC) blood coagulation platform system."

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is aimed at developing a nondestructive testing device based on Magnetic Pressure Sensor Technology. The innovation can detect steel mass and corrosion in bridges, tendons, infrastructures, and pipes. The technical level of this innovation is ?early stage?, where the scientific principles have been identified and feasibility will be established in this effort. Safety is an increasing concern for the nation?s bridges. According to a bridge report published by the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), over two hundred million trips are taken daily across deficient bridges in the United States? largest metropolitan regions. The innovation possesses favorable features that make it suitable for different non-destructive testing (NDT) applications. Those features include it being safe to operate, having real-time fast imaging speed, light-weight, battery operated, scalable to different sizes, flexible to address different shapes, and affordable to multiple field deployments. The overall market for non-destructive testing and inspection was valued at $6.46B in 2015 and is expected to increase to $11.39B by 2022 at a CAGR of 8.3% between 2016 and 2022. The intellectual merit of this project is the development of a Magnetic-Pressure-Sensors (MaPS) device, which already demonstrated significant promise for use in generating volumetric images of steel mass loss in exposed post-tension reinforcement tendons in bridges. Rotating the MaPS device around the circumference of the tendon or placing multiple devices around the circumference; can provide a 2D cross-section map of the total internal steel mass distribution. The device has also been tested on corroded steel rods and it was able to react only to the total steel mass as rust (mainly Fe2O3) loses the magnetic property of iron. The innovation here is the combination of a magnet, a pressure sensor between the magnet and the surface of the structure, and a communication device to report the force detected by the pressure sensor. This combination provides a force signal directly correlated to the mass and location of steel inside the inspected structure. The objective of this proposal is to develop a MaPS sensor technology to measure and image steel mass loss in bridge tendons and pipelines. This will be achieved by developing a magnet arrangement for better penetration depth, an activation pattern of distributed magnets, image reconstruction, and mechanical enclosure."

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will demonstrate feasibility of the first metrology system capable of quantifying surface roughness in three dimensions in situ in production environments. Current shop floor systems are almost entirely two-dimensional stylus-based systems that are fragile, incapable of measuring complex geometries and have high cost of ownership. A shop-floor, 3D roughness system will enable greater sampling, faster process feedback and improved time-to-results which will enhance competitiveness across a wide range of U.S. industries including medical devices, aerospace, transportation, and defense. All precision machined components call out surface roughness or texture, yet achieving consistent results with existing contact gauges is difficult and time consuming. It is believed that a shop floor, non-contact roughness measurement device could gain significant market share, with sales upwards of $50M\/year upon proving correlation with existing trusted laboratory techniques. Also, trusted, readily available roughness information on almost any machined surface will enable enhanced quality, lifetime, and aesthetics for precision manufacturers, improving competitiveness and reducing waste across a variety of industries. The intellectual merit of this project is due to its leveraging of recent advances in a variety of fields including additive manufacturing, precision optics, microprocessing, image sensors and interferometric algorithms to achieve nm-scale vertical resolution in a vibration-immune device deployable in manufacturing environments. The closest similar product has vertical resolution more than 100X worse than is proposed here and the proposed performance goals present significant challenges to achieve both high resolution and hand-held capability. A successful Phase 1 will prove that significant synergies between advances in various fields can be combined to significantly advance performance over prior generation products. Also, if successful, manufacturers will have access to a far greater range of process control parameters on more types of surfaces and will be able to improve quality and yield significantly via faster and more accurate feedback into their production cycle. The output of this Phase 1 program will be a first article device that can be brought to customers for demonstration in a shop floor environment. The device will correlate with existing techniques while solving many key issues, such as alignment difficulty, scratching surfaces via a contact measurement, and lack of three-dimensional surface information."

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase I project seeks to transform treatment regimens for individuals suffering from malaria infections. Malaria, particularly caused by Plasmodium vivax (P. vivax) and Plasmodium ovale (P. ovale) remain a potential cause of morbidity and mortality amongst the 2.85 billion people living at risk of infection. The only drug currently available for treatment therapy for P. vivax and P. ovale is primaquine, which can cause life-threatening anemia in individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. Clinicians often do not prescribe primaquine due to the high prevalence (8%) of individuals who are born with G6PD deficiency. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Program for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH) are urgently searching for a reliable assay for the diagnosis of G6PD deficiency to effectively treat patients and aid in the eradication of P. vivax and P. ovale malaria. This novel assay proposed will quantify G6PD and hemoglobin (Hgb) concentration simultaneously from a finger stick sample. This system comprises a single test strip coupled with a reflectance-based meter and cell phone application with Blue Tooth connectivity to incorporate a patient?s I.D., test results, global tracking, and history of treatment. It is projected that this point-of-care assay will be used to screen &gt;23 million people for G6PD within 5 years of launch and generate over $27.5 million in compounded revenue. In the long term, the novel assay will create a universal point-of-care platform that can be utilized for other diseases or conditions that affect patients in the Unites States for which point-of-care assays are not currently available. The proposed novel platform will quantify both Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) and hemoglobin (Hgb) concentrations simultaneously from a single finger stick sample using a point-of-care (POC) reflectance-based meter. There is currently no such device on the market, which is urgently needed to screen patients being treated for P. vivax and P. ovale malaria. A significant portion (8%) of the world population is G6PD deficient, which places these individuals at risk for life-threatening anemia after treatment with current therapeutics such as primaquine against malaria. The POC assay utilizes a novel lysis and reagent layer membrane platform to enable a reflectance-based meter to measure non-over lapping wavelengths to quantify G6PD and Hgb concentrations. In this proposal, a functional prototype reflectance-based meter and data collection software will be constructed and compared to readings obtained using the current ?gold standard? Konica Minolta spectrophotometer. Secondly, the POC assay will be validated through performance testing using a G6PD-deficient whole blood specimen bank provided by the Program for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH). Concordance of the data obtained from 20 samples for the proposed assay will be compared to the World Health Organization?s (WHO) approved spectrophotometric method for measuring G6PD and an FDA approved method for measuring Hgb. Success will be indicated by an R2 &gt; 0.95, which demonstrates linear equivalency, as well as a demonstration that 90% of the data points fall within 2 sigma of each value. A POC assay that can simultaneously screen patients for both G6PD deficiency and Hgb levels will allow clinicians to treat patients with P. vivax and P. ovale malaria infections effectively and aid in the eradication of malaria."

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase I project develops chemical tools and platforms to produce valuable chemical building blocks that can be used to produce synthetically challenging compounds on large scales. These compounds belong to the class of polypropionates which is known for its diverse and powerful biological activities across multiple indications within the pharmaceutical, agrochemical, and veterinary industries. The high impact of the polypropionate class is hampered by the inefficiencies of current chemical processes to fully tackle their complex structures. Importantly, the lack of scalability adds another severe complication to the development process. To fully unlock the potential of this class, improved chemistries with greater efficiencies are required to successfully identify high impact candidates for further development. Moreover, the new tools are excellent substrates for polyketide?{enhanced drug discovery. This project is a prelude to the development of a novel class of compounds against rare and unmet needs in cancer in collaboration with the NCI\/NIH. Such cancers pose a huge burden on the healthcare system and the economy in general. Inspired by the NSF mission, this project describes an innovative chemical process that can deliver highly valuable compounds. Such an approach will enable accelerated discoveries across multiple medicinal and agrochemical needs. This project aims to provide all sixteen possible stereotetrad building blocks (in the form of chiral lactones) for construction of polypropionates on practical scales. Those chiral building blocks can serve as common precursors for synthesis of polypropionates, as tools for rational design and structure activity relationship (SAR) studies, or as entries for more diverse and complex library of analogs. The chemistry platform used to produce those building blocks is referred to as the Chiral Carbon Catalog (CCC). The CCC platform is a synthetic tool box that allows stereoselective large scale economic synthesis of various complex polypropionate building blocks from simple starting materials. The unified process has been carefully designed to employ highly diastereoselective substrate directed transformations while avoiding expensive and impractical chiral auxiliary overheads or expensive catalysts. The high efficiencies of transformations allow the elimination of tedious and expensive purifications such as column chromatography. The crystalline natures of key intermediates enable facile production on scale and allow the synthetic routes used by the platform to be easily adopted by the industry for large scale production. This ensures adequate supply of those building blocks for development of complex chiral products within several industries (e.g. pharmaceutical and agrochemical fields)."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve the lives of over 500,000 patients with end stage renal disease receiving thrice-weekly hemodialysis treatments in the US each year. Hemodialysis requires the blood of a patient to be removed and passed through a filter for cleaning prior to returning it to the patient. Oftentimes patients receive insufficient dialysis treatments because the traditional blood pathways cannot be effectively sustained. This leads to increased infections, hospitalization rates and deaths. In addition to the unnecessary suffering of patients, the cost of maintaining these blood pathways is over $2B annually. This implantable device will improve our technical and scientific understanding of hemodialysis shortcomings and may lead to advancing the knowledge in medical fields related to arterial and venous access. This innovation will allow enhanced hemodialysis treatments for this vulnerable patient population by maintaining blood pathways and lowering infection rates. The proposed project is to create a vascular access device which ensures that end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients have reliable vascular access without the need for an arterialized venous system. AV fistulas and AV grafts often fail to mature and are associated with suboptimal long-term patency rates resulting in a loss of the patient?s life line to dialysis. The objective would be to create a completely subcutaneous device which can be anastomosed to an artery and a separate vein such that the arterial device can obtain a blood flow of at least 400ml\/min and the venous device can return the dialyzed blood at a rate of at least 400 ml\/min. The device must allow blood flow through its lumen only when needed and return the native vasculature to its normal flow state after each use. The technical difficulty is how to configure the mechanics of the device and its anastomosis to blood vessels in a manner which allows it to be opened and closed on demand without causing thromboses to form within the native vessels or device. We will be using computational fluid dynamic modeling and an iterative design process to achieve our prototype."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to enable early mass vision screening of preverbal children by primary care physicians as a result of the development of a reliable, rapid, mobile and affordable vision screening tool. That tool will allow the integration of early vision screening during the well baby care visits. Early childhood vision problems are a major public health issue, affecting 3-5% of infants in the US alone. The vision screening tools currently available for young children are only indirect measures of vision, have limited sensitivity, are not quantitative, too complex and, time-consuming to allow all children to benefit. Early detection and treatment of vision impairments improve vision treatment outcomes and prevents early learning development deficits. This SBIR project will increase access to vision screening at an earlier age, resulting in improved treatment and visual outcomes, allow screening in more situations and locations, and result in a commercially viable, clinically reliable measure of visual function in young children. The proposed project will enhance the vision screening digital platform for preverbal children and validate testing performance and reliability against the current clinical standard (Teller Acuity Card procedure). That digital platform functionality includes user interface, scalable testing patterns, and video output. That platform leverages the innate optokinetic response (OKN), the mobility of a tablet computer and the access and computational capability of the cloud. Cost and complexity of existing vision screening solutions and, lack of cooperation from those young patients have limited access and use of many current testing methods for young children. Two thirds of all preschool children in the US have never had an eye examination or vision screening before starting school. The proposed solution will increase the access of preverbal children to early mass vision screening in the primary care practices during the well baby care visits."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to significantly increase the efficiency and reduce operating costs for water produced by membrane-based desalination. Water scarcity is an increasingly important global-scale issue that has significant negative impacts on health, security and economies. Recent forecasts show a dramatic increase in the number of countries that will soon be affected by water scarcity given that global water consumption is expected to significantly increase due to population growth. Membrane-based water desalination, which at large scale requires a huge capital investment, is recognized as a primary technology that can significantly improve supply to meaningfully offset scarcity and its impacts. A critical factor in desalination plant operations is energy consumption, which increases due to membrane fouling, thus making fouling one of the most significant factors controlling the efficiency of these plants. The proposed in-situ, real-time sensing system can be the enabling technology to allow implementation of advanced plant control algorithms based upon accurate detection of fouling at its earliest stages. Such active detection capability will enable the most effective implementation of fouling mitigation strategies that can be optimized to save energy and reduce cost. This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a novel time-reversal waveguide sensor for detection of early-stage (ES) fouling in reverse osmosis (RO) membrane desalination, which is the dominant technology for desalinating brackish water and seawater. Fouling in RO systems has inorganic (scaling) and organic (biofouling) components and can be a highly variable process that depends on operational parameters as well as environmental conditions. Efficient implementation of real-time control of RO desalination for fouling mitigation requires real-time sensing. The overall objective of the proposed work is to develop sophisticated ultrasonic sensor technology that can reliably detect scaling and biofouling in the challenging multi-layer, spiral-wound (SW) geometry of commercial-scale RO systems. The proposed work will make use of time-reversal mirrors to produce a simple signal from a multi-mode waveguide independent of the geometry of the waveguide configuration, thus overcoming the exceedingly complex and difficult to interpret signals associated with the use of a standalone waveguide. The goals of the project are to demonstrate the capability to detect both early-stage inorganic and organic fouling under realistic operating conditions, the reliability and the robustness of the technology, and the ability to adapt the technology to the larger size modules that are increasingly important for commercial operation."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable the high sample testing throughput necessary for quantum magnetic bioassay technology to be used for medical diagnostics, precision health and point of care patient care. Ultrasensitive detection of low-concentration biomarkers, many of which are currently undetectable by existing technology, offers new diagnostic capability for improved clinical decisions and better patient health. Existing high-sensitivity diagnostic instruments are very complex to use, expensive and require lengthy sample processing steps - all of which increase health care costs. A new class of magnetic-based assays combining high sensitivity and low sample processing using NV diamond quantum sensors has been developed. Magnetic assay platforms can deliver equivalent results to current biomarker assays faster and at significantly lower cost. A dramatic reduction in sample processing, combined with direct detection of magnetic tags, will provide rapid test results, a critical component for point of care diagnostics. A remaining challenge for this approach is delivering bioassay samples to the sensor quickly and repeatedly - a challenge to be addressed in this project. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a rapid sample transfer mechanism to enhance the sample throughput of bioassays using a quantum magnetic sensor. Quantum sensing enables revolutionary magnetic sensitivity and spatial resolution in a modality compatible with biological samples. However, the sample must be delivered close to the diamond sensor for analysis, and transfer between samples must occur in seconds, all while maintaining sensing performance. Prototype sample transfer systems designed and fabricated in this project will implement an innovative new process to rapidly transition between assay samples. The hardware will be compact, require little power, and be manufacturable at low cost. Prototype sample transfer hardware developed in Phase I will form the basis for subsequent engineering of quantum sensor based bioassay devices, with initial applications to the research use only (RUO) sector, and later to clinical in vitro diagnostics. This advance will bridge the gap between the capabilities of quantum magnetic sensing and the sample throughput needs of clinical applications."

According to the National Institutes of Health, cancer cost the U.S. an estimated $219 billion in 2007, including $130 billion for lost productivity and $89 billion in direct medical costs. The proposed screening technology is expected to help gynecologists in hospitals or in private practice to provide a complete diagnosis in less time, reducing the number of visits and the endometrial cancer incidence through an early detection, especially in women over 50 years old. This would benefit the medical insurance by lowering the cost per patient with this type of cancer. If successful, the proposed non-label\/real-time cancer diagnostic device will contribute to new scientific findings and engineering aspects in bio-sensing technology. The resulting device will also provide a non-invasive, fast, and accurate method to detect cancer for preclinical diagnosis. In addition, the research based on this technology will improve a range of equivalent studies that use similar systems and biological indicators. The proposed project is aimed to develop a POC technology for the sensitive detection of telomerase as a cancer measurable indicator in real-time. Telomerase is a distinctive enzyme whose presence in cells or tissues is used for screening, early cancer detection, prognosis and\/or monitoring a residual cancer disease. The proposed technology is based on the detection of telomerase in cancer cells through the measuring of an in-situ elongation process of an immobilized label-free single strand DNA probe by means of sensitive electrochemical events occurring at the conductive gold microchip surface. For the development of this new sensing microchip device the team will use commercially available products. Silicon wafers have been used as substrate with gold as electrodes due to their reliability but these materials are expensive and the fabrication is labor intensive. Therefore, important diagnostic device parameters will be studied after incorporation of bare bio-sensing strips. Phase I of this project, is aimed at demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed technology as well as testing the reliability and robustness of the microchip biosensor using uterine cancer samples."

The proposed approach has the potential to open a new vertical in the analytics market in which chatbots aid humans in carrying out the task of creating, deploying and running complex data science pipelines. This project could lead to the creation of a sub-market in the existing analytic software market, and it could also help improve the productivity of the (non-technology) sectors of the economy that increasingly require high-quality and fast insights from both their archival and real-time datasets. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will take on a number of technical challenges including designing and developing a method to allow programming the underlying program that powers chatbots. Another technical challenge that will be tackled is making it easy to load external data that may not have well-defined schemas. A type inferencing mechanism, and associated set of methods to learn over historical data, will be developed to address this research aspect. Another technical challenge is building good machine learning models, for which a set of mechanisms is proposed that will allow automatic exploration and ranking of machine learning models, aiding the user in picking the right model for the specific task at hand.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is aimed at developing a superior platform for the preparation of samples for cryogenic Transmission Electron Microscopy (cryo-TEM). Cryo-TEM provides images of morphologies and structures of liquid-based samples with nanometer resolution, which provides crucial insight for the development of materials in the pharmaceutical, chemicals and consumer goods industries, amongst others. Cryo-TEM sample preparation requires a sample thinning step, which results in a ~10-100 nm thick film that is appropriate for both sample vitrification and imaging. Commercial platforms provide thin samples with a blotting process, which has many drawbacks. Blotting leads to a variety of significant sample artifacts due to shear induced on sample structures. Furthermore, time required for blotting limits temporal resolution for studies of dynamic processes. A proprietary blotless sample thinning strategy reduces shear induced on the sample, and improves temporal resolution of sample preparation, by orders of magnitude. The integration of an innovative process with these advantages into a commercial platform would capture a large portion of the cryo-TEM sample preparation market, and even expand the cryo-TEM market due to improved and expanded characterization capabilities crucial to many industries. The intellectual merit of this project involves the development of an innovative blotless sample preparation process that overcomes the aforesaid drawbacks of the commercial state of the art, while providing extensive areas of thin sample film for imaging. Experiments and simulations will build a rigorous understanding of the critical properties of these processes, namely fluid flow induced by the process, and corresponding shear in the sample, the time required for removal of excess sample volume and the resulting yield of sample film area for imaging. This research will provide control of a superior sample thinning process that will be integrated into a disruptive cryo-TEM sample preparation platform. This platform will provide unparalleled insight into materials and processes that will reduce risk and accelerate development timelines for many industries utilizing nanomaterials."

        "abstract": "The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to equip consumers with a scientific tool to measure and control their exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, thereby mitigating their risk of getting skin cancer while enjoying the benefits of sunlight such as Vitamin D and outdoors activities. In the United States, skin cancer has become a major public health issue with an estimated 3.5M people being treated each year for a cost of over $8B. The rate of Vitamin D deficiency in the US has been estimated to be over 40% leading to increased risk for depression, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Up until now, accurate measurement of ultraviolet exposure remains confined to research laboratories. This project aims at carrying a scientific breakthrough in UV dosimetry and bring a laboratory-grade technology to consumers. The proposed project aims to achieve a scientific breakthrough in UV dosimetry by combining several detectors, machine learning algorithms, and customized calibration. We anticipate that this breakthrough will lead to a drastic improvement in accuracy to closer match that of laboratory-grade equipment, while keeping the size and cost of our instrument in line with consumers? expectations. The scientific challenge is to have the UV sensor be accurate when it measures most solar spectra, and there is an infinity of these based on location, weather, and time of the year. Our strategy is to stay away from incremental improvements (e.g. filter optimization) or expensive developments (e.g. a full-blown spectrometer). Instead, we are testing the hypothesis that the combination of machine learning algorithms and a small set of carefully chosen detectors will enable us to build a small low-cost instrument able to identify the local solar spectrum and provide correctly calibrated real-time measurements. To achieve this, we propose to apply clustering techniques to find representative spectra of solar UV and train several detectors to recognize them and correct the measurement. The execution of this project requires top-level R&amp;D among diverse collaborators, whom we have gathered for this project."

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase I Project will evaluate the ability to directly use local materials, such as plastic recyclables as the consumable input for affordable, industrial 3D printing. This technology will be developed with intent to scale to multiple 3D printer platforms. Hardware will be sold commercially after project completion as a novel 3D printer platform as well as a modular attachment for other 3D printers and 3D motion systems. To broaden the impact of the research, all prototyping will be documented in a series of monthly videos intended for educators, STEM organizations and US makers to witness real-world application of the hardware design process. Additionally, workshops will be held once a quarter where progress to date will be showcased and students will be invited to share feedback. This technology has significant opportunity to expand US in-house manufacturing capability, foster new job creation through enhancing industry and educational ties, stimulate US driven innovation and reduced trade dependence on imports of manufactured products. While the Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) method of additive manufacturing offers tremendous potential for on-site fabrication, the technology is limited by access to extruded feedstock materials. Specifically, the ability to locally source raw material and introduce it directly into a 3D printer via direct drive pellet extrusion is necessary as the focus of industrial additive manufacturing shifts from producing prototypes to manufacturing end-use products. This need is amplified when 3D printing large-scale (defined as &gt; 6 inches cubed) functional objects. Producing larger outputs represents a larger investment of time and material costs with existing FFF systems, which currently constrains the additive manufacturing market. Secondly, a dependence on extruded thermoform plastics limits the available library of materials. This project includes development of novel extrusion feed mechanisms for processing pelletized and non-uniform reclaimed plastic feedstock. Phase I goals include optimization for virgin and recycled polyethylene terephthalate (PET\/RPET), Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS), and Polylactic Acid (PLA). This system will be developed for affordability and user experience to allow for easy switching between materials and print speeds 20X faster than FFF methods. Hardware will be sold commercially after project completion as a complete 3D printing system as well as an attachment for 3D printers and 3D motion platforms."

        "abstract": "The broad impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will benefit the members of the ALS community as this wearable technology and data collection enables greater independence for individual ALS patients allowing them to remotely communicate with caregivers and clinicians, and control environmental elements within their living spaces as well as being able to monitor their progression for self-care. Expanding the communication connection between and among the ALS patient, caregivers and clinical care team members creates a dynamic, multidisciplinary care environment, which can thoroughly address the changing needs of an ALS patient. The proposed technology could bring immediate and ongoing assistance to ALS patients and will remain functional as physical changes occur due to the progression of ALS, even when a patient has lost all movement ability. The immediate target market for this type of technology is individuals with severely impaired ability to move and speak. Neuromuscular conditions including multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy, spinal cord injuries and severe stroke affect 1.5M people in the US and 30M people globally. This population has very limited options for effective communication and control and are largely underserved by existing technologies. The proposed project aims to create a technological platform to address communication and accessibility issues within care environments for patients affected by Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Patients with ALS develop a progressively reduced ability to communicate and interact with interface technology such as mice and keyboards. Each patient has dynamic needs due to the differing progression rates of the disease. This creates an opportunity to provide a personalized human-computer interface with data collection capabilities. The objectives of the proposal involve testing the effects of skin-electrode impedance and electromagnetic interference (EMI) from medical equipment such as ventilators and powered wheelchairs on the quality of biopotential signals. Furthermore, it involves personalizing signal classification models based on an individual&apos;s physical impairment. Advanced signal processing techniques, including Morlet wavelet and Hilbert transform, will be used to filter the data collected from multimodal sensor inputs. This will ensure a robust system design for multiple care environments, regardless of life support and technological equipment within that space. In addition, a human research study will be conducted with ALS participants in order to acquire a relevant data set."

        "abstract": "The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the improved identification of young children who may be at risk for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Autism is a growing concern as rates continue to increase, however many experts in child development are hopeful that early intervention can help reduce many of the challenges of living with autism. As the brain undergoes important critical periods of development in the first year of life, it is important to try and identify opportunities for intervention as early as infancy. However, infants have limited means to express themselves and it can be difficult for parents and even pediatricians to track the subtle behavioral cues that can be indicative of autism at this early age. The goal of this proposal is to improve access to tools that help make infants developing thinking and social skills more observable to pediatricians and parents. By creating a consumer version of an old technique used by psychologists to understand infant development, this work will increase access to tools to track infants&apos; behaviors related to autism. The proposed project is novel in its repurposing of an established laboratory psychology tool, the nonnutritive sucking paradigm. Basically, psychologists long ago learned that infants will alter their rate of sucking on a pacifier when they are interested in something. Psychologists recorded from a pacifier to gauge what an infant was interested in as well as an infant&apos;s growing understanding of language, social interaction, math, and a wide variety of cognitive and social skills. They also allowed infants to control the presentation of sounds or images through their sucking patterns. This SBIR project is creating a more accessible version of this established smart pacifier technique to allow parents and pediatricians to also better track an infant?s interest, preferences, and social and cognitive development. This effort will develop a consumer friendly smart pacifier that can control sounds or images on software or mobile applications. By designing software that replicates the social and cognitive assessment paradigms in psychology laboratories, the smart pacifier system can increase access to objective behavioral assessment tools. Similar to growing evidence in eye-tracking behavior, this behavioral assessment tool can be used to better assess behaviors that have been linked to the future development of autism."

The societal impact includes (1) reducing the cost related to readmissions for Congestive Heart Failure, Acute Myocardial Infarction, and pneumonia, a total of $5.8 billion annually paid by U.S. taxpayers, (2) decreasing the cost of each hospital stay by $5-10K per Medicare beneficiary by using proven treatment and discharge planning models, (3) reducing the burden on post-acute providers (primary care physician, long-term care, home health, ambulatory care) by achieving optimized clinical stability prior to discharge, and (4) providing a method for a patient population (studies show who are eager to participate) to actively engage in their own treatment decisions. The proposed project will create a proprietary algorithm that produces a patient-specific hospital readmission-risk score. The score is based on the algorithm&apos;s dynamic adjustment of all known readmission risk factors determined by the patient&apos;s unique profile that includes clinical and other factors. The goal of the project is to accurately predict a patient&apos;s readmission-risk using the dynamic algorithm. The results of the algorithm will be verified via the facility&apos;s claims system. Technical challenges to be addressed by Phase I include the compilation of known risk factors, development of the algorithm, and creating multi-tract data input methods to obtain live data. The research and development plan will focus on identifying risks, development of the algorithm, and determining methods for capturing live data needed to execute the algorithm."

        "abstract": "This SBIR phase I project will develop new reagents to enable cell separation and analysis. Cell separation is a $3.9 billion\/yr market with applications in medicine, pharmaceutical, and biological research industries. However, many current schemes perform cell separation and analysis in separate steps. A single reagent that could perform both functions would save time and money, enhancing these industries. The nanoparticle reagent developed by this research possesses magnetic properties to enable cell separation, and fluorescent properties that allow properties of separated cells to be quantified. This research will optimize this product and demonstrate proof-of-concept against the current standard approaches. The proposed product is the result of basic research previously funded by the NSF into methods to combine magnetic and fluorescent reagents, and optimization of this reagent will yield basic knowledge in manufacture and scale-up of these nanomaterials. Successful completion of these goals will lead to a new product that will enable cell separation and analysis with a single reagent, enabling cell separation with high purity and increasing signal used for quantification. These benefits could translate into reduced laboratory healthcare costs with increased diagnostic efficiency, improved pharmaceutical purity, and high tech nanomanufacturing jobs in this burgeoning industry. This research will develop magnetic-fluorescent nanoparticle reagents to enable seamless cell separation and subsequent flow cytometry analysis. Cell separation is often performed with magnetic reagents that enable high throughput; however, analysis of the separated product is performed in a separate step, typically via flow cytometry. The use of large magnetic beads for separation prevents analysis, as the beads employed are much larger than the protein quantified. Even if small nanoparticles are used, a separate reagent is required for analysis, and signal is limited as the same receptors are targeted for both separation and analysis steps. Thus, a reagent that could perform both separation and analysis steps would improve performance. This research will optimize nanoparticle reagents that enable separation and analysis and compare their performance to the current approach using two separate reagents. Thus, this research will demonstrate crucial proof-of-concept of these reagents that are manufactured using a scalable process, enabling rapid transition to beta testing and follow-on commercialization."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is in the development of novel water treatment technologies that can improve access to clean water and reduce the cost of water treatment. The innovation is a drop-in-replacement nanofiltration membrane that is chlorine-resistant, highly permeable, and uniquely customizable. The chlorine resistance allows for the continuous chlorination of the membrane, which can reduce bio-fouling and thereby increase the lifespan of a membrane; this has been a chief innovation target for more than 30 years. The customizability aspect also facilitates capture of lead and other heavy-metals, broadening the reach of nanofiltration membranes to sectors that generate significant amounts of wastewater, such as semiconductor, mining, pulp-and-paper, and colorant industries. These improvements to nanofiltration technology have clear and direct societal and economic impact by facilitating water reuse and offering clean and affordable water solutions. SBIR project funding is enabling the transition of this promising membrane technology from the laboratory setting into the early commercialization stages of a valuable new product. This SBIR Phase I project proposes to improve the commercial viability of novel nanofiltration membranes through the development of more-scalable and tunable synthesis and manufacturing protocols. The technology is based on self-assembling block copolymers with customizable chemical functionalities. Previous methods for the synthesis and casting of the polymers are not ideal, so new protocols are being developed. The changes to polymer and membrane manufacturing methods will be conducted systematically to develop new structure-property-performance relationships that will contribute new knowledge for broader membrane optimization efforts. A more thorough understanding of how polymer chemistry dictates membrane performance will also be cultivated by investing in the customization aspects of the technology. Finally, the performance characteristics of resulting nanofiltration membranes will be rigorously tested with respect to permeability, chlorine-resistance, separations, and heavy metal capture. The overall results will help advance nanofiltration membrane technology into a platform that is highly modular and can address a wider range of separations challenges than is currently possible."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this project directly addresses the estimated $3.2 billion healthcare burden that develops from iatrogenic ureteral injuries that occur across the three million abdominal and pelvic surgeries being performed annually in the United States. Allotrope Medical creates innovative surgical solutions to improve patient outcomes and reduce procedure costs, directly addressing this situation. Allotrope?s devices improve anatomical structure location and tissue identification thereby reducing the potential for injury while enhancing a surgeon?s confidence for reduced procedure time. Using smooth muscle stimulation, Allotrope?s StimSite is a sterile single-use, battery powered device that safely and reliably identifies the ureter location to avoid injury during these abdominal and pelvic surgical procedures. The ureter naturally contracts while draining urine from the kidneys into the bladder. This smooth muscle structure is at risk of injury during dissection and pinching, the current standard surgical method, to mechanically elicit this contraction and thereby locating the ureter during surgery. Allotrope has demonstrated StimSite?s ability to elicit the same contraction without surgical dissection, thereby diminishing the injury risk while also significantly reducing the surgical procedure time. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR Phase I project will advance the smooth muscle electrical stimulation technology used in StimSite. The project will improve product development and clinical understanding of the design&apos;s operating limits while increasing the product&apos;s clinical utility through better integration with the laparoscope&apos;s imaging system to display a stable indication of the ureter position. This project encompasses three objectives: First, using an instrumented breadboard device, the proprietary electrical pulse waveform will be studied characterizing how varying the waveform parameters affect tissue contraction responses. Second, the performance of the preferred waveform will be evaluated in a porcine model to confirm in-vivo performance of a stand-alone configuration. Third, available image processing software will be evaluated to track and trace the ureter contraction and retain a road-map of the ureter position displayed on the monitor after the ureter has relaxed and is no longer directly visualized. These three objectives will substantially advance Allotrope&apos;s smooth muscle electrical stimulation technology platform for the current device use and targeted future applications in esophageal, stomach and bowel tissue identification, etc."

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is for the development of a wireless sensor for continuous and real-time measurement of the high temperature in gas turbines. The new sensor offers turbine manufacturers and owners\/operators the capability to place small-sized sensors in hard to reach areas in the turbine, and transmit sensed data wirelessly thereby enabling heat loads to be quantified. According to gas turbine engineers interviewed during National Science Foundation I-Corps program, increasing the firing temperature of a turbine by 100\u00b0C, due to accurate real-time temperature measurement, will result in 1% increase in efficiency. This translates to additional revenue of $48 million\/year for a fleet of 100 turbines. In addition, these sensors can extend useful life by 10,000 - 25,000 hours per turbine due to enhanced maintenance planning, translating to an additional revenue of $76.7 Million ? $192 Million per turbine. In 2009, the United States Environmental Protection Agency established that emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants, leads to negative effects on human health and the environment. The new wireless sensor will help to design more efficient gas turbines and improve operations of existing turbines thereby reducing harmful emissions from power turbines. The intellectual merits of this project include: development of high-temperature sensing technology beyond its current stage; usage of newly developed materials (polymer-derived ceramics -PDC) for sensor applications; advancement of fundamental knowledge of process-property relationship of PDCs; improved sensor design and modeling; better understanding of sensor integration challenges and techniques for advanced sensing in gas turbine environment. The new wireless sensor is made of PDC. Advantages of PDC include high-temperature survivability, excellent oxidation\/corrosion resistance, flexible manufacturing, and tunable electrical\/mechanical properties. The sensor consists of a novel microstrip patch antenna for reliable wireless transmission of sensor data while keeping the overall volume of the sensor small so as not to distort gas flow profile in the turbine. High gain patch antenna will enable sensor to be interrogated at longer distances outside the turbine. The project objectives are: develop a wireless PDC sensor that can measure over 800\u00b0C to demonstrate high-temperature wireless sensing capability; demonstrate high-temperature wireless sensing beyond 50 cm; study sensor system implementation strategy in ultra-high temperature environment of a turbine engine; conduct preliminary investigation into sensor integration into existing turbine prognostic systems."

Health Information Networking Tool (HINT) will be a unique combination of customized algorithms that will fill in critical gaps in knowledge, especially around health disparities, the social determinants of health and underserved conditions; boost opportunities for safety net providers to connect with peers to engage in collaborative problem-solving; reduce duplication and repetition of errors and failed interventions across safety net healthcare organizations; increase public recognition for safety net institutions that develop promising interventions; and enable technical advancements in machine learning to suggest models of care for high-need\/high-cost patients. The commercial impact for HINT includes: reducing the cost and improving the quality of care delivered to high-need\/high cost populations; and creating opportunities for safety net institutions and providers to market their expertise on caring for complex, underserved patients. The proposed project was conceived on the belief that ingenious solutions in caring for society&apos;s most vulnerable populations occur daily across the safety net health system; that HINT will accelerate innovation by bringing an unprecedented resource to disseminate voluminous and constantly changing healthcare information; that the proposed information network will reduce the fragmentation of information and duplication in errors and failed interventions that currently occur; and finally that unlocking and disseminating innovations and advice from peers - in similar institutions and caring for similar patients - will accelerate successful practices to improve the health of high-need\/high-cost patients. HINT proposes to develop unique crawling, clustering, text mining, collaborative filtering, bipartite matching, and ranking algorithms. The team will integrate the six algorithms into a customized social content management system, and address challenges around design and functionality."

This sensor technology is based on &quot;smart&quot; molecularly imprinted color-changing nanomaterials that eliminate the need to run tedious sample preparation and analysis procedures using conventional laboratory instrument. The use of a colorimetric sensor as a cost-effective consumer sensor has far broader applications than just date rape drug detection, including applications where on-the-spot detection could help protect consumers from other harmful chemicals, pathogens, drugs, explosives, nerve agents, allergens, etc. In addition, this project will advance colorimetric sensing technology using structural color into a robust and rapid sensing platform for drug monitoring with high sensitivity, response time, and accuracy. This STTR Phase I project proposes to develop a platform technology based on a highly accurate, color-changing sensor that will initially be used to continuously monitor a beverage for date rape drugs, and instantaneously detect these adulterants if they are present. Drug-facilitated sexual assault has become a significant issue, but there is currently no drug-sensing drinkware available on the market. This drug sensor will be implemented using highly selective molecular imprinted polymers as target drug receptors and non-toxic color-changing nanomaterials as signaling reporters. The scope of the research includes the rational design of the color-changing nanomaterial used as a signaling reporter for the target drug binding event, the development of a highly selective molecularly imprinted polymer and its integration with reporters, and the testing of the color-changing sensor under different matrices and conditions to verify its sensitivity and specificity."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to develop technology that will substantially reduce the cost and complexity of ribonucleic acid (RNA)-based medical testing. Isolation of RNA from biological samples is the first and often the most difficult step in RNA diagnostic testing. All living things from bacteria to humans are threatened by viral infection and have strong natural defenses; these protein defenses are beneficial to humans but interfere with RNA testing. DNA contamination also interferes with RNA testing. As a result, there is a $2.3B market for reagents to clean-up protein and DNA contamination in RNA samples. The proposed product selectively isolates RNA from samples with near perfect selectivity, eliminating the need for these expensive RNA clean-up reagents. Simplification of the RNA isolation step has the broader impact of allowing for smaller and easier to operate devices that can be deployed to local clinics, allowing for easier and faster testing in point-of-care and rural settings. This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a new carbon-based coating for magnetic beads that selectively isolates RNA from samples with better yield than current products and without DNA or protein contamination. The company has developed a preliminary technology that performs better than competing products when used to isolate RNA from cultured cells. During this Phase I project, the material properties and usage protocols will be optimized to maximize performance in real-world applications, such as isolation of RNA from blood. The material properties as they relate to performance in this application will be studied using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and optimized to maximize selectivity for RNA over contaminating molecules such as DNA and proteins. RNA will be isolated from diverse biological substances such as soft tissue, blood, and cell cultures, and each step in the process will be optimized to maximize yield and RNA integrity (RIN) while maintaining perfect purity as determined by northern blot, fluorescence spectroscopy, and qRT-PCR. The company also will begin to explore a manufacturing system for commercial production of the material."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will primarily benefit the 11.4 million people with hand amputations worldwide. By making and selling a prosthetic hand at a price lower than competing devices, the proposed prosthetic hand is expected to be more affordable for people with upper limb amputations. Increasing robustness by incorporating compliant materials should allow patients to use their hands longer without worry of damage. By incorporating pressure sensors, the team expects to enable patients to precisely manipulate many different types of objects. Two former war veterans with amputations have already been enabled with early versions of the proposed technology. Through the low cost of the device and the advanced features unique to the hand, the goal of this project is to help the millions of hand amputees worldwide to regain independence and confidence in their lives through innovative prosthetic devices. The proposed project involves development and evaluation of an affordable, robust myoelectric prosthetic hand that provides natural, compliant grasps with pressure feedback to users. Making the hand compliant will require the use of soft, compliant materials not used in currently available commercial prosthetic devices. The design and materials used in the hand must be robust enough to last at least two years of daily usage. Finally, sensorizing the hand will require placing pressure sensors and electronics in the fingers that also need to withstand impacts. Feasibility will be established through the performance of each design iteration in accelerated life tests (150,000 flex\/extend cycles) and human subject experiments (performance after activities of daily living and motor control tasks). The capabilities of the Phase I prototype will be extended in Phase II for delivery of a complete myoelectric prosthetic hand system that is ready for clinicians to use with patients."

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase I project will develop a novel imaging adapter to temporarily integrate imaging into any needle or probe, enabling clinicians to visualize and identify anatomical markers in-situ, via real-time visualization, to improve vascular access without major modification of existing needles and technique. Venipuncture is the most common invasive procedure in medicine. Despite this, failure rates are 20-30% in easy access patients and 45-70% in difficult populations. Initial failed access leads to complications, increased hospital cost and poor patient outcomes. The proposed adapter represents a distinctive shift away from the way image guidance is currently used and several elements make this integrated, forward imaging system a transformative improvement: 1. It does not fundamentally change the standard procedural technique; 2. it improves image comprehension by ensuring the clinicians will always know what they are imaging (i.e. directly in front of the needle) drastically reducing complications caused by the needle penetrating the anatomy surrounding the target vessel, and; 3. The adapter will provide 10x better resolution than current imaging aids such as ultrasound. The proposed adapter will improve care of patients and significantly reduce healthcare costs by improving first time access success rates, reducing procedure complications, failures and escalations. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), is a recognized transformative imaging aid. Data suggests that integrated tip-sourced imaging with OCT drastically improves both patient safety and outcomes by allowing the physician real-time decision-making capabilities for minimally invasive procedures. However, there has been no commercially successful market penetration of forward looking needle-based OCT imaging technology. There are a number of reason for this: 1) the challenge of acquiring clinically relevant images; 2) the cost and the challenge of developing a system that economically puts OCT at the tip of a needle; and 3) the challenge of clinical usability. The project will address these concerns with the development of a disposable OCT-based imaging adapter. Five significant technical challenges will be addressed: ensuring correct placement of the probe at the tip of the needle after connection and advancement; incorporating scanning at the fiber tip in order to acquire two dimensional clinically relevant, forward facing images; determining the optimal angle of light projection from the probe; determining the optimal universal lens tip design for cost and ease of advancement through tissue; and lastly, integrating key research finding into a final probe design that will become the basis of the commercialized adapter. Solving these technical challenges will pave the way for FDA approval and subsequent commercialization of the device."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this project is to enable drones to autonomously fly close to both outdoor and indoor infrastructure and assets, such as bridges, tunnels, buildings and warehouse goods, and to inspect them without relying on human pilots, external markers, and availability and reliability of data from a Global Positioning System (GPS). Many assets, such as bridges and warehouses, require drones to fly in GPS-denied environments making it impossible for existing systems to do localization and perform autonomous flights. The proposed technology will allow for faster, more frequent and thorough, less expensive and safer inspections, enhancing public confidence in the use of transportation assets. The proposed technology will also reduce the number of injuries caused by manual inspections, because of personnel having to access hard-to-reach or dangerous locations, lowering insurance and health care costs. Federal and state resources that would have been spent on inspection and maintenance could then be reallocated to other initiatives. In the case of bridge inspection, the proposed technology will eliminate the need for costly lane and bridge closures. The global opportunity to create savings, enhance safety and reduce externalities in infrastructure and warehouse inspection markets by using autonomous drone technology is substantial. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will involve developing an onboard, autonomous and reliable Advanced Perceptive Navigation system for drones to perform bridge, warehouse and other infrastructure and asset inspection by flying close to assets under challenging conditions including GPS-denied environments. Existing drone technology heavily relies on GPS data and drones can only be safely flown tens, if not hundreds, of meters away from the asset due to lack of precise control by human pilots and lack of positional accuracy of commercial autopilots. Such distances are inadequate for many situations, which require high-resolution imagery. The proposed solution will not rely on a global geographic frame of reference, but instead sense and perceive features of the asset that will allow the drone to navigate and optimally position itself with respect to the asset to collect images. Robust and computationally efficient algorithms will be developed, to be run onboard in real-time, for object detection, feature extraction and reliable tracking of points of interest from cameras and depth sensors mounted on drones. Developed algorithms will be integrated with the actual drone platform, and indoor test flights as well as field testing will be performed."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to revolutionize the healthcare industry by developing computing solutions for precision medicine. Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) now produces a large amount of genome data at an affordable cost. Analyzing large volumes of genome data from diverse populations will lead to a better understanding of the causes of various diseases ranging from cancer to rare genetic disorders, and develop better cures. By sequencing a patient&apos;s genome, it is possible to more specifically determine his\/her condition and devise an individualized treatment plan. And, if every newborn&apos;s genome was sequenced, it would allow for proactive identification of disease risks, and early intervention. Understanding viruses and bacteria will help us gain a better understanding of infectious diseases, and thereby enable us to develop better immunization and disease control methods. In addition to health-care, genomics also may help engineer better food crops and attain food security. This project will develop novel computing hardware solutions that are customized for genomics sequencing software. These computing solutions can help realize an exponential growth in the digital genomics market and bring affordable personalized medicine to all. This SBIR Phase I project proposes to accelerate Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) by building a customized processor for genomics automata. Over the last decade, the production cost of sequencing has plummeted from ten million dollars to a thousand dollars, and is soon expected to go below a hundred dollars per genome. Advancements in processor performance, however, have not kept pace. It can take several days on a computing cluster to sequence a genome. For genome sequencing to become as affordable as a routine medical test, computing solutions are required that can sequence a genome in minutes, and cost only a few dollars per genome. This project is developing a novel ASIC hardware accelerator for computing finite state automata, which supports approximate string matching, a computational kernel widely used in genomics applications such as sequencing. The design is based on a novel in-memory hardware technology for efficiently implementing state transitions. The goal is the improve efficiency of genomics automata by two orders of magnitude compared to modern processors."

To many, it&apos;s dirty, disgusting, and someone else&apos;s problem to solve. Unfortunately, we all suffer the consequences, as litter impacts our economy, degrades the environment, demoralizes community pride, kills wildlife, and poisons the food system. This project aims to develop a mobile technology that empowers anyone to identify, map, and collect the world?s litter, while simultaneously connecting to a broader community of associated brands, cities, schools. By crowdsourcing the data and cleanup, there is great potential in collecting massive amounts of information which can be used for everything from infrastructure improvement, to resource allocation, brand packaging redesign, and even individual responsibility and behavioral change. The intellectual merit of this project is derived from building a global database of litter. And one critical need to achieving such a monumental task is the ability to quickly (and accurately) identify any piece of litter, anytime, anywhere even if the litter is in a deep state of decay and decomposition. This project further aims to integrate that information with other data sets including location, time, proximity to schools, and the watershed. By leveraging technologies such as image recognition and machine learning, the project will further empower the people who are crowdsourcing the data and cleanup to collect a vast amount of identifiable information."

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a material which when added to commercial paint and coatings can improve indoor air quality by actively removing and degrading Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs). Indoor air quality is generally five times worse than outdoor air quality and VOCs are prevalent in indoor environments, being emitted from typical household items like electronics, cleaners, and flooring. People spend 90% of their lives in indoor environments, making poor indoor air quality a more acute health risk. VOCs are known to cause and worsen allergic diseases such as asthma and eczema, which combined, costs the United States approximately $56 billion in medical spending and lost work productivity every year. Alleviating the discomfort and financial burdens posed by allergic diseases can improve the standard of living of over 60 million affected Americans in the United States. Low- and zero-VOC paints ($9 billion market) are the fastest growing segment of architectural paints ($62 billion market). This technology has the potential to dramatically improve indoor air quality and make everyday living better for children, the elderly, and adults suffering from allergic diseases. The intellectual merit of this project will further the understanding of using diatoms in conjunction with a photocatalyst to harvest light as an energy source for the removal of pollutants from environments. Diatoms have been shown to increase the collection of ultraviolet, blue and red wavelengths of light. As a substrate for photocatalysts which utilize these wavelengths, diatoms may provide a superior light collection capability, increasing the effectiveness of photocatalysts. The proposed aim is to show an increase in the photocatalytic rate of VOC degradation which could help to make metal oxide photocatalysis a more viable option for air treatment. The proposed research makes the following contributions: 1) advancement of efficient visible light photocatalysis with a diatom-based additive; 2) understanding integration of photocatalytic paint additives into base paint and coatings mixtures, optimized for minimal paint substrate degradation and maximal photocatalytic degradation of indoor air-pollutants; and 3) long-term improvement of indoor air quality. Overall it is expected that this Phase I will show diatoms, as substrates, can increase the rate of photocatalysts up to two times under typical irradiation sources. This project targets cleaner indoor environments through pollutant removal activity without increased energy usage."

Radiotherapy is the most common approach for treating cancer. The radiotherapy treatment procedures happen for multiple days (5-35 days) during which the radiation treatment efficacy may be lowered because of changes in the patient anatomy. This project provides the clinician the ability to obtain information regarding the radiation dose to be delivered to both the tumor as well as the surrounding normal organs before the treatment is delivered. The successful outcome of this project will allow radiation oncologists to plan and deliver advanced treatments where the radiation dose delivered can be quickly modified to suit the current tumor location and motion, to only encompass the tumor and effectively spare normal tissues. The project outcome will also enable physicians at remote clinics to receive guidance from experts to perform online adaptive radiotherapy, enabling a new era of radiotherapy treatment world-wide. The cloud-based framework will work with most image-guided radiotherapy equipment. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will enable development of technology to effectively perform quality assurance tests to determine a more accurate radiation dose and reduce the number of fractions in the treatment of many cancerous tumors. The soft tissue surrounding the cancer varies in its physiological behavior, which alters the treatment efficacy when not accounted for. While a conventional hypothesis would dictate that better tumor targeting during radiotherapy would yield an improved treatment response, patient survival statistics dictate otherwise, indicating that accurate treatment guidance has not been facilitated to date. The research will focus on developing a cloud-based framework of computed tomography and magnetic resonance image processing for fast deformable image registration and radiation dose accumulation estimation, with an automated methodology for quantifying the deformable image registration performance. The technical results may facilitate an automated framework for accurately tracking a patient&apos;s anatomy, computing the accumulated dose delivered and reporting dosimetric endpoints for critical structures in near real-time, which will be vital for enabling online adaptive radiotherapy."

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase I project will study novel methods for extracting and recovering valuable metals from an abundant industrial waste source, namely coal combustion fly ash. If successful, the technology developed in this project has the potential to reduce the environmental and societal risks of both newly generated- and legacy coal combustion wastes, while strengthening the supply chain security of raw materials critical to advanced technology and green energy applications. Moreover, by establishing a secure long-term supply of affordable scandium, this project can catalyze long-lasting improvements in commercial and personal transportation. Demonstration of this highly-selective, solvent-free metal separations technology may also influence a paradigm shift in the metallurgical industry towards more sustainable practices. Validation of technologies for waste utilization and value creation is an attractive avenue for transitioning coal-dependent regions towards economies based on advanced manufacturing and high-tech jobs. Previous attempts to extract metals from industrial wastes have suffered from technical limitations that the technology developed in this project overcomes. Based on commercially-available engineered polymer supports, our suite of adsorbents exhibits REE-selective functionality across broad pH regimes, enabling flexible, complementary deployment and high rates of reagent recycle. The goals of this project are to translate the laboratory-scale synthesis schemes for our novel adsorbents to greener, industrially-scalable chemistries and to demonstrate a holistic system prototype that validates the key unit operations of our process together. The former will be accomplished by following well-established protocols of the chemical industry under the supervision of our commercial partner and the latter through extensive, dynamic subsystem testing and finally construction and operation of a lab-scale prototype. The project team expects the final deliverable of this development effort to constitute a high-fidelity demonstration of the process at a Technology Readiness Level of 5."

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase I project will address the need to retain more diverse students&apos; science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) interest and increase their scientific literacy and 21st century skills. These goals are critical for the United States to remain competitive in the global workforce and reinforce goals of individual prosperity that are enhanced by developing STEM skills. There is therefore a strong market need among educators and parents alike for STEM video games that support development of these skills. This project will create an expert-level group challenge in an online video game for multidisciplinary integrated science learning that will increase students&apos; scientific problem solving and collaboration skills. This innovation will empower teachers to do hands-on, integrated STEM cooperative group learning with highly engaging authentic experiences based on well-researched pedagogical best practices such as cooperative learning and inquiry-based science practices. Key innovations include novel instructional design for live simulated group challenges and generating a scalable architecture that will serve as a framework for creating authoring tools and additional challenges in the future. This work upholds the National Science Foundation&apos;s missions to strengthen the United States&apos; workforce competitiveness. This project will establish the technical and commercial feasibility of the collaborative live simulation challenges for groups of students. Key technical risks include creating effective group simulations with randomly seeded variables that run live within a 3D Gameworld, given the limitations of consumer and institutional technology, and developing a scalable architecture which will allow applications of this innovation in additional contexts. The innovation in these areas will lead to future applications of this technology to create content authoring tools which enable scalable group challenge content development to expand to additional STEM content areas across elementary to high school age groups, and can be extended to support teachers making custom challenges based on local interests on demand without technical skills. By the end of Phase I, the project will lead to (1) producing a playable challenge based on integrated disciplinary core ideas in middle school level life science, aligned with Next Generation Science Standards; (2) answering key technical questions around bandwidth and simulation technical limitations for the proposed solution with accessible technology in our target applications; (3) addressing key technical risks around the deployability of the project; (4) collecting initial data on the educational application benefits."

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to develop a delaminated zeolite-based catalyst to facilitate more economical and environmentally friendly propylene-oxide (PO) production. PO is a commodity chemical with a $5.6B\/year market. The two current pain points for PO producers are (i) that the currently used industrial catalyst lacks long-term stability under the harsh conditions at the tail-end of the PO synthesis reactor, and (ii) as a result of catalyst deficiency, that the process to manufacture PO consumes an extra $140M of raw materials per year, separate from the problem in (i) above. Berkeley Materials Solutions developed a catalyst for the tail-end of the PO synthesis reactor that nearly eliminates both of these problems. The catalyst allows for nearly 100% conversion of all raw material into PO, which leads to $145 M\/year of additional revenue for PO producers, corresponding to a revenue increase of 8.6%. This increased revenue comes at no additional cost since it is a drop-in replacement. In addition, there are significant energy efficiency improvements associated with recovering the currently lost raw material in the PO synthesis process, which amounts to a CO2 footprint of ~740 kilo tons of CO2 per year worldwide. The intellectual merit of this project will be represented by the development of a generalizable crystalline catalyst platform to replace existing amorphous catalysts. Technical hurdles that will be addressed in the proposal are (i) the successful delamination of a layered zeolite precursor using a swelling method and sonication, (ii) establishing a sonication-free scalable delamination method for layered zeolite precursors, and (iii) the insertion of catalytically active heteroatom sites into the delaminates frameworks. If successful, this will enable the economical production of these zeolite catalysts for application in the PO synthesis reactor under flow conditions. The targeted scales even during Phase I activities are large enough to enable testing in collaboration with industrial partners who manufacture propylene oxide at large scales. These test results will be used to optimize the prototype catalyst. The results from Phase I activities will help to uncover other possible opportunities to use delaminated zeolites as highly efficient catalysts for chemical manufacturing."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is a healthier honeybee population to increase food security. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization, annual production must increase by 60% from 2007 to produce enough food for an estimated 9.1 billion people by 2050, which will be impossible without honeybee pollination (Food and Agriculture Organization, 2012). Honeybee populations have declined precipitously for the past 60 years?a total loss of 3 million hives (National Agricultural Statistics Service, 2007). Annual hive losses cost the U.S. economy $2 billion (National Agricultural Statistics Service, 2016; The White House, 2014). This project aims to enhance scientific understanding of the problem by finding practical solutions to hive loss for beekeepers, advancing IoT applications in beekeeping, and automating data analysis for beekeepers. Researchers and experts suspect the declines are due to multiple factors, but research is limited by a lack of technology tracking the hives on a large scale. Researchers&apos; inability to perform analysis on a large, diverse dataset has obstructed their ability to draw conclusions on causes of hive loss and drive innovation on traditional beekeeping methods.\u00a0 This proposed project will advance Internet of Things applications in beekeeping by automating data analysis for beekeepers through algorithm building. Several studies built models to describe actions inside the hive. However, these are built on limited data or are theoretical. Henry et al., 2016 mentioned the need for predictive algorithms to be expanded to larger data sets to reduce hive loss. Data driven beekeeping is in its infancy as an industry, but based on the success in the AgTech space, data monitoring will be a necessary step in solving colony health problems. The project will take a database of over 4,000 hives to improve research models for practical monitoring. This database will be paired with sensor and monitoring data from project hives. Through the project hives the company will confirm the sensor quality for commercialization. The company will create a baseline model of a healthy hive to detect anomalies. These anomalies will be worked into a predictive model to detect problems related to pests and diseases in the hive. The company will look for broad detection of a threatened hive, then drill down into specific problems (like Varroa mites). These finds will be included in monitoring products offered to beekeepers."

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase I project will develop a hand-held, point-of-care, sensing strip and instrument for immediate identification of which bacterial species are causing a urinary tract infection (UTI) in a companion animal. This technology will allow veterinarians to judiciously prescribe antibiotics for an animal during the initial examination. In the United States alone, there are nearly 1.5 million veterinary visits annually for UTIs in dogs and cats. The average time to initial UTI test results is 48 hours, during which time the animal is generally consuming antibiotics. Less than half of urine cultures show any bacterial growth, indicating that the majority of antibiotic prescriptions were unnecessary. Further, it is important to identify which bacterial species are causing the UTI, so that the proper antibiotic can be administered. Prudent use of antibiotics will control the spread of infection and the emergence of antibiotic resistance, thus resulting in healthier animals and reducing the need for new antibiotic drug development. This project will help translate the initial research and discoveries that were funded previously by the National Science Foundation. The underlying principle for this technology is that each bacterial species produces and excretes its own unique set of chemicals that are used to coordinate intercellular activities, analogous to pheromones produced by animals. It is possible to identify what bacterial cells are present in a sample by detecting these chemicals. There are much greater quantities of the chemicals in the sample than bacterial cells, making this approach more sensitive and easier to implement than other technologies. The proposed research will result in the creation of a label-free, aptamer-based, electrochemical sensing platform for the detection and identification of the four most common Gram-negative bacterial pathogens causing UTIs in companion animals, within two minutes of sample collection. The novelty of the approach is to measure unique quorum sensing molecules (QSMs) that are secreted by the bacteria. These QSMs are produced by all bacterial cells continuously at a rate of approximately 10,000 molecules per hour, thereby improving the limit of detection by four orders of magnitude. An array of electrodes, modified with novel aptamers and functionalized with electro-active molecules, will be used to detect the QSMs, acting as biomarkers, produced by each bacterial species. Combining optimized aptamer molecules with electrochemical sensing and a proprietary signal processing algorithm allows for unprecedented limits of detection, sensitivity, and specificity. The technology will work directly in complex fluids without any reagent addition or separation steps."

Global expanding markets for DJ gear, a $1.587B dollar growth industry, over the past 3 years grew in sales by 21%. As technology and entertainment converge, DJs represent the new &quot;Superstar&quot; for today&apos;s youth. Thus, this research represents an incentivizing gateway for students to learn how math, engineering and science intellectual assets can contribute to musical and artistic innovation. Additionally, middle and\/or junior high school students&apos; analysis of the data derived from a performance and entertainment-related technology can be an incentivizing and engaging entrance into STEM academic subjects such as systems design, acoustics, and computer coding. Given the DJ tool&apos;s relation to these topics as well as music&apos;s inherent link with physics and math, its integration into the curriculum of after-school programming options are expected to foster more interdisciplinary STEM learning. Afterschool turntable academies as thematic contexts for STEM learning function as supportive and assistive educational venues. Collectively, the broader impact of this project should produce economic competitiveness in the music\/technology industry for the U.S. overall and, specifically for youth, enhanced engagement in STEM fields. The intellectual merit of this project stems from the necessity for individuals to seamlessly interface with the digital world without losing creativity, artistry or individuality. The technical innovation emerges from determining the coordinate location of an analog audio occurrence, tracking the change in occurrences, and matching it to a digital counterpart to follow the changes created. The sensor data points are utilized to metamorphose the turntable, the musical instrument of the DJ, into a complete analog\/digital educational tool. This technology can offer critical insights to STEM learning and educational opportunities to students who may feel that STEM concepts or careers are separate from their personal interests and cultural context. Anticipated outcomes include advancements in the arts, sciences and education by contributing to entertainment&apos;s most recent and broadly recognized musical instrument and making it more available in middle and high school STEM educational curricula and after school activities. The proposed research intends to investigate, identify and resolve current liabilities connected with the transient acoustic degradation, deleterious latency introduction, and physical performance loss by systems intended to mimic the analog turntable. The research objective will be to create novel interface models to analyze the elements captured from the DJ musician and translate these into a commercially and educationally viable platform."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve the safety of firefighters through the research and development of a real-time, wearable sensor system comprising a biometric heads-up display and accompanying analysis tools. This device collects each firefighter?s vital signs in real-time, displays the information via a heads-up display, and alerts them if they are in danger. Simultaneously, it will send the data to authorized officials for real-time strategic decision-making. By receiving access to life-critical information, the commander can make informed decisions on the allocation of key resources during the hectic scene of an emergency. Firefighting is chaotic; every year over one million firefighters risk their lives to protect others. Over 50% of the deaths in firefighting are caused by overexertion and stress, which can induce heart attacks as well as other serious medical issues. Furthermore, around 70,000 firefighting injuries occur each year. The proposed system aims to reduce the amount of firefighting injuries and subsequent costs, which totaled $7.8 billion in 2004, but the design is not limited to firefighting. The proposed system can be easily adapted to serve similar occupations such as military personnel and industrial workers. The proposed project may be the first to monitor the effects of the extreme nature of fire incidents with physiological stressors and provide this data in real-time. The proposed technology could significantly improve the occupational safety of firefighters and further enhance the scientific knowledge created by studying their physiological states. The proposed project includes three main technical objectives: 1) The research and development of a rugged wearable system that will monitor the physiology of firefighters in real-time. 2) The research and development of a machine learning algorithm to identify key markers that will indicate the exertion and stamina levels of first responders in chaotic environments. 3) The development of a long-range radio system capable of transmission within large urban structures comprising various possible interferences. All three objectives will consist of two pilot studies with an intermittent development phase in between, where feedback from the first pilot study will be incorporated into both the hardware and software. It is expected that the outcomes of this project will demonstrate a significant reduction in firefighter injuries, paving the way for a clear return on investment for the partnering fire departments."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project addresses the critical societal need to remediate widespread problems of toxic organic pollutants in soils, sediments and groundwater. The technology results in a significantly improved ability to destroy organic environmental contaminants by reducing treatment time and costs at commercial scales using novel bacterial strains. These strains have a demonstrated ability to rapidly degrade a variety of important, recalcitrant organic pollutants including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PaHs) and dioxins. This project will assess the costs and efficacy of the large-scale implementation of this technology that includes the incubation of the contaminated material at elevated temperatures (60\u00a2\u00aaC\/150\u00a2\u00aaF) to enhance degradation. This enables environmental goals to be met on many sites whose cleanup is currently limited by the high costs of remediation. The commercial impact is significant and makes possible the re-development of many billions of dollars of real estate in these categories to return these properties to productive and appropriate use. Additional aspects of the technology are applicable to emerging pollutants such as 1,4-dioxane in groundwater and greatly expand the options available to environmental engineers and landowners for cleaning up long-lived pollutants. This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop two novel modes of destroying organic contaminants of concern that reduce remediation costs and improve outcomes. The project improves on prior approaches to bioremediation by using heat-tolerant bacteria for faster rates of chemical destruction for a broad range of pollutants. Objectives include the evaluation of the efficacy and costs to treat large amounts (5-10 tons) of material with whole bacteria as basis to assess the commercial application of the technology. This involves several components, including the optimization of the large-scale cell production protocols to produce the bacteria. In conjunction with environmental engineering firms, the project also will develop cost-effective approaches to maintaining the appropriate temperature, moisture and oxygen conditions for optimal cell growth during large-scale treatments. Variations in incubation conditions and flocculent additions will be used to determine the lowest pollutant levels that can be attained. Finally, a new approach using cell extracts instead of live cells will be evaluated for both soils and sediments as well as for soluble pollutants like 1,4-dioxane. These approaches will provide critical data on remediation costs at commercial scale and also evaluate new approaches to emerging groundwater pollutants that are difficult to remediate with current technology."

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase I project will study the development of a digitally configurable shape around which a shoe can be created. The results of this project will enable the mass-customization of shoes so they can precisely fit the feet of the individuals who wear them. Properly fitting shoes are intended to improve the quality of life of customers through reduced pain and improved musculoskeletal health. This development in shoe-making technology is of broad interest to the population of the United States, but particularly important to women, who often suffer from physical deformities and injuries caused by ill-fitting shoes. The proposed innovation relies on mass-customization methods and flexible robotics technology. Its anticipated success will provide additional jobs in the shoe industry and related fields, and improve productivity nationwide through reduced healthcare costs. The strong technical innovation in this project will be the adaptation of granular jamming technology for use in programmable shape technology. The driving goal of the proposed project is to develop a last for use in the mass-customization of shoes that is capable of changing shape in response to a digital representation of the customer&apos;s foot shape. After changing shape, it will lock into a rigid but smooth form appropriate for use in traditional shoe manufacturing methods. The scope of the research will cover the development of the last in a manner appropriate for use in manufacturing conditions (in terms of both physical and temperature durability) and the creation and implementation of algorithms for transforming foot shape data into an appropriately fitting shoe shape and for transforming a standard shoe pattern onto an arbitrary foot shape. Iterative design practices and just-in-time manufacturing techniques will facilitate the development of this new technology and manufacturing methodology."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project includes advancement of the field of white biotechnology, which utilizes enzymes to create valuable industrial products. As biological molecules, enzymes are more difficult to work with than conventional chemicals and often need more extensive development before they can be adapted to industrial or pharmaceutical manufacturing. This SBIR project will demonstrate how enzymes performance can be improved using stabilization with synthetic polymers. Enzymes are characterized by precise, unique structure and function, which is in turn essential for their role in catalysis of complex chemical reactions. Synthetic polymers, on the other hand, despite being less precisely structured, can be rationally designed to withstand or respond to chemical, thermal or biological conditions. The synergistic fusion of enzymes and synthetic polymers results in advanced nano-armored enzyme with improved properties such as solvent and temperature resistance, and modulated activity. Creating such novel stabilized enzymes will result in more efficient commercial utilization of enzymatic catalysis which requires less energy, utilizes less hazardous reagents, and generates less waste while generating valuable products such as chemicals, biofuels, and pharmaceuticals. This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a combinatorial synthesis device that can feed high-throughput screening of enzyme-polymer conjugates with desired properties (for instance, temperature, pH- or organic solvent stability). To date, only low-throughput synthesis and characterization methods have been applied to the preparation of enzyme-polymer conjugates, limiting development to only few types of polymer modification per protein and depending on stochastic guesswork to select the variants tested. Thus, in order to fully benefit from the diverse set of polymers currently available on the market one has to consider methods of scaling the identification of optimally performing enzyme-polymer conjugates. This will be achieved through combination of high-throughput synthesis of enzyme-polymer conjugates and high-throughput screening of gained properties. The initial target application of the proposed research is focused on the industrial biocatalysis. Application of a high-throughput method will not only result in faster research and development cycles, but also will accelerate our development of fundamental knowledge of what kind of protein properties can be gained through polymer modification, thereby establishing this method for industrial applications."

The United States is becoming increasingly dependent on technology to remain competitive on the global stage and our education system must evolve to more effectively train our next generation of technology workers. There were only 59,581 computer science graduates in 2015 compared to 527,169 open computing jobs. This shortfall is magnified considering the majority of graduates must teach themselves critical skills to become productive workers in private industry. This tool not only impacts higher education institutions and their graduates, but also coding academies, high schools, workforce development agencies, private companies, recruiters, and government bodies. There are 2,650 institutions offering computer science degrees in the United States and all are potential users of this tool. The market size for this tool is estimated to be over $400 million. The intellectual merit of this project is the development of a tool that can 1) assess what higher educational institutions should be teaching within computer science as demanded by private industry, 2) determine how effectively institutions are currently teaching these skills, and 3) benchmark these institutions compared to their peers. The innovation inherent in this project is a real-time measurement of skills demanded in the private sector, rather than lagging years behind, and a real-time score of how well institutions are currently performing. The data provided by this tool will allow institutions to modify curricula at a significantly faster pace and dramatically increase the productivity of graduates. The tool proposed will be based upon an aggregation of millions of data points from disparate sources such as university catalogs, job postings, and resumes. Raw data is then cleansed and analyzed to produce actionable insights for end users in a visual presentation layer, tailored to individual institutions."

Successful cyberattacks, including mass privacy breaches and the discovery of device backdoors, have shaken trust in computing, put users at risk, hurt the economy, and even threatened our national security. The usual set of ad-hoc, incomplete, and costly approaches simply have not addressed the problem. This research effort will advance a viable, practical, and holistic solution that gives users much stronger guarantees of security while lowering the costs of keeping systems secure. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop TigerGuard, a computer system security architecture that contains the effects of cyberattacks on existing computer infrastructure. TrustGuard is based on a small, separately manufactured, and easy-to-verify hardware element, called the Sentry, that serves as the root of trust. The Sentry is a general-purpose hardware trust component that, when combined with an application-specific Dynamic Specification Check (DSC) software component, provides flexible containment capabilities. The containment guarantees of TigerGuard hold despite design and manufacturing flaws (known and not-yet-known, malicious and unintentional) in the operating system, firmware, hardware, and software, including those in the application software itself. Formal verification of both the Sentry and DSC, a practical effort given their total size of only a few thousand lines of code, becomes equivalent in security guarantees to proving hundreds of millions of existing lines of code correct (including the processor design, memory implementation, hard drive firmware, the operating system, shared libraries, and the application code)."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to prevent over $50 billion in wasted building utility costs annually across the US by increasing domestic shower efficiency. \u00a0Commercial adoption of this technology at scale will save 200 billion gallons of water and at least 1 trillion kWh of energy in the U.S. every year. \u00a0Reducing waste water and energy use decreases the strain on municipal water and energy infrastructure. \u00a0Lower energy use will also have a significant impact on carbon emissions associated with electric generation. The innovation will enhance scientific and technological understanding by developing a highly-accurate novel sensing technology that works in hot and humid conditions. Moreover, the occupancy detection technology can be used for other applications where difficult ambient conditions prevent the use of conventional sensors. The IoT device will generate valuable end-user utility use behavior data which public institutions and private industry will use to design better policies and best practices. In addition to the economic, technological and environmental benefits, this research also promotes jobs by providing enough utility savings to commercial buildings for them to increase their staff. The proposed project will eliminate behavioral water waste which occurs when a bather leaves a shower unoccupied even after the water has warmed-up. \u00a0Developing the technology requires: (1) a device that can accurately sense shower occupancy, (2) a compact enclosure resilient to a shower?s hot and humid environment and, (3) low energy circuitry and algorithms for long battery life. \u00a0Methods to achieve the project objectives include acoustic signal analysis for sensor accuracy, in-situ pilot testing, CAD design and prototyping to achieve device size constraints, and accelerated aging tests to ensure reliability and durability. \u00a0The overarching goal of this phase I feasibility effort is to validate the novel utility savings methodology, occupancy sensor accuracy and calibration over at least 5 years, and a device battery life of at least 2 years. \u00a0This project will be deemed successful if the following key technical objectives are met: (1) The sensor performs within at least a 1% error margin after relevant nondestructive, accelerated aging tests, (2) The amount of water and energy saved is at least 20% when compared to baseline during live hotel pilot tests, and (3) The device?s battery life is at least 2 years."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be a revolutionary, high-speed, high-resolution and extremely high-sensitivity camera. This Quanta Image Sensor (QIS) camera will be the only compact complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) camera in the market with photon counting capability at room temperature. This camera can be used in scientific and medical imaging applications where high sensitivity is extremely important and the current state-of-the-art camera technologies cannot satisfy the needs of the consumers, and customers are desperately seeking a better camera solution. The QIS is a platform imaging technology and can be used in a broad range of imaging applications, such as automotive, augmented-reality &amp; virtual-reality, security &amp; surveillance, etc., where high-sensitivity, high-resolution and high-speed are required. Moreover, since the QIS technology is compatible with the mainstream CMOS fabrication lines, it has the potential to dominate the image sensor and camera market by high-volume production. The image sensor market is expected to expand at an annual growth rate of 10.4% from 2015 to 2021, reaching $18.8 billion market value by 2021. The proposed project addresses the major drawbacks of the state-of-the-art scientific EMCCD cameras, such as high noise (around 1 electron with external cooling), nonlinear response and unpredictable readout gain, low-resolution, low-speed, massive size and extremely high power consumption. In this project, a manufactured QIS test chip will be implemented into a 1 megapixel prototype QIS camera which can function at 1000 frames\/s and the whole camera power consumption will be less than a Watt. The average noise will be around 0.21 electrons that unlocks the true photon-number-resolving at room temperature with about 99% accuracy. The modular compact QIS camera will contain some peripheral digital IC chips, power supplies, FPGA, USB 3 interface, etc. A QIS image processing algorithm will be implemented in the camera module to form and output images from the binary bits received from the imager. Advanced industrial and commercial standard tests and characterizations will be performed to comprehensively measure the performance of the prototype QIS camera. Also, the camera will be tested by alpha-customers and their feedbacks will be received. In order to improve the development, the results will be applied in future QIS cameras in the Phase II of the SBIR program."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this project is that the project addresses one of the most critical and challenging problems in stroke rehabilitation - shoulder and arm rehabilitation. More than 800,000 people suffer from a stroke per year in the US and most of them are left with arm and shoulder impairments. This robotic invention has the potential to deliver revolutionary benefits to these stroke survivors, including better recovery outcomes and shorter length of hospital stay. Indirectly, the innovation will improve vocational skills and prevent consequential safety accidents after a stroke. The major outcomes of this work has the potential to improve the rehabilitation outcomes of not only stroke patients but also those with upper extremity neurological and musculoskeletal impairments. The project will create a unique opportunity for exposing the PI and researchers to the process of translating basic research into deployed technology. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will validate the capability of the proposed rehabilitation robot technology for correcting abnormal coordination of the shoulder complex after stroke. Although rehabilitation hospitals have long sought a technological innovation that will lead to a higher clinical efficacy than conventional care, there is no robotic intervention commercially available that fully addresses the shoulder rehabilitation problem. The PI and collaborators will validate the proposed design and controller with experiments with human subjects. The planned experiments will confirm the proposed robot technology that addresses the abnormal shoulder coordination problem, which is critical for the shoulder rehabilitation after stroke. In addition, PI and collaborators will define and develop a minimum viable product (MVP) of the proposed innovation which will confirm the product-market fit."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this project is to bring to the market a high-resolution digital fingertip: an easy-to-use, compact, and compliant sensor that will provide human-like tactile sensing. Such a sensor can be used to automate assembly tasks in next-generation factories, enable smart objects to understand their tactile environment, and equip scientists with a finger-like sensor for studying human touch. Industries have been transformed by the digitization of our auditory and visual worlds. A high-resolution digital fingertip will provide the mechanism for digitizing the tactile world leading to applications and technological developments that will touch many industries. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a compact, compliant, and high-resolution tactile sensor based on GelSight elastomeric imaging technology. This project proposes a modular optical and illumination architecture for GelSight imaging that will create the appropriate conditions for 3D measurement in a compact package. The modular system can be tiled to cover a large field of view without increasing the device thickness. This effort will lead to new insight into illumination design for shading-based 3D measurement as well as optimizations to allow for real-time tactile information. The system will be coupled with a software development kit (SDK) that provides real-time tactile information, including contact locations, contact force and contact shape. The SDK will make the system accessible to researchers and engineers from other disciplines, which is essential for the successful commercialization of the technology. The high-resolution digital fingertip, together with the SDK, will provide a foundation for further exploration into digital touch as well as applications that benefit from tactile information."

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will build children&apos;s motivation to read and help them access books best suited to their individual interests, purposes, and abilities. Even though robust research demonstrates both intrinsic motivation to read and print book ownership strongly shape reading achievement, few existing educational software products address them. The project will develop a voice chatbot app elementary students will use in class to receive personalized book recommendations and coaching on choosing well. An associated book subscription service will allow kids to own books they choose, including in very low income schools through partnerships with non-profits. Together, these offerings will tap a combined U.S. children&apos;s book and literacy educational software market for grades 2-5 that tops $1.4 billion dollars annually. Unlike most other &quot;personalized&quot; or &quot;adaptive&quot; learning systems, the app will use machine learning and artificial intelligence to increase the agency of students and teachers. It will focus on helping students improve their ability to make their own choices rather than making those choices for them. The intellectual merit of this project lies in its innovative combination of a recommender system and a pedagogical agent to simultaneously assist students in completing an authentic task (choosing books to read independently) quickly and well while also teaching them to complete the task increasingly effectively and independently over multiple performances. The voice conversational interface will provide this combined task support and coaching through an emotionally engaging narrative experience accessible to struggling readers. The research will yield a field-tested prototype of the system, constructing a domain model, authoring conversational content, developing machine learning technology, and iteratively improving the system through usability and pilot testing in elementary school classrooms. Technical challenges include tuning automated voice recognition in naturalistic classroom environments, overcoming the cold start problem to generate high quality initial recommendations, and supporting acquisition of both cognitive and metacognitive skills within an ill-structured domain where measurement of successful performance has complex dependencies with student identity and social context."

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project uses a new class of chemosensor films to continuously measure the concentration of heavy metals in a flowing stream of industrial wastewater. This will make it possible to know the concentration of several heavy metals at any given time so that treatment chemicals used to remove those metals can be metered precisely. Current treatment methods typically rely on infrequent sampling of wastewater streams and time-delayed, labor-intensive laboratory measurements. Without the ability to measure continuously, wastewater treatment is adjusted based on periodic averages and estimated peak discharges. To reduce the risk of regulatory violation, most wastewater treatment systems use twice the volume of treatment chemicals than might otherwise be needed. With the ability to measure metal concentrations continuously and automatically, wastewater treatment can be controlled in real time, cutting treatment chemical costs, solid waste costs and measurement labor costs by more than 50%. Continuous measurement also reduces the risk of regulatory violations by &gt; 90%, in turn reducing the potential costs of remediation and compliance as well as improving environmental conditions for the general public. The key outcome of Phase I research was the successful development of 15 new chemosensors permanently bound to a substrate, each with a unique response to zinc, cadmium, cobalt, chromium, lead, copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, mercury, nickel and tin. In Phase II, responses from an array of chemosensors will be fully characterized with a prototype instrument developed for commercial use in different industrial environments. With that instrument, a mathematical model will be constructed to accurately convert sensor responses into scientific units of measure for multiple dissolved metals. The lower limit of detection for existing sensors ranges from 5 ppb to 50 ppb. In parallel with analytical modeling work, chemosensor synthesis work continues to lower the limit of detection to 1 ppb, extend sensor life beyond 6 months, and broaden the portfolio of sensors to improve metal selectivity. In the future, this new class of bonded chemosensors may be extended to determine the concentration of phosphates and many other species that are currently sampled occasionally and measured with lab instruments. For applications where continuous measurement is important, this unique family of chemosensors offers great potential for real-time process control in a variety of industrial applications."

Competing educational tools are not designed to help those who are natively fluent in Spanish transfer their skills to a new language. Consequently, more than 40% of non-native speakers drop out. If successful, this project will bring to a wider market an existing educational product (created by a small, minority-owned business and already in use nationwide), and improve the educational opportunities for hundreds of thousands of non-native English-speaking students in both language arts and the scientific disciplines core to the National Science Foundation?s mission. Moreover, because schools face significant financial pressure to improve student achievement and because the product is competitively priced, it will be shown to be commercially viable, and a plan will be developed to expand the market for the tool outside of the state of California where it was initially studied. An expanding body of research has shown that language learners perform better on standardized tests when they can transfer their ability in another language (Spanish) to the acquisition of English. However, existing tools have not yet met this market need and focus instead on English-only instruction optimized for students who already speak natively. This project proposes to fully develop and market an existing language-acquisition platform found to be effective during pilot research in a large California school. SBIR Phase II research will address outstanding hypotheses suggested by Phase I results, and determine whether the tool can be easily adopted by stakeholders. Specifically, the impact of assignments chosen by teachers will be disambiguated from the use of the tool more generally, and the impact of English-only versus bilingual scaffolding will be studied in more detail to tailor the product to individual use cases. During Phase II, the product will also be integrated with existing academic systems and analytical software, and competitive per-seat pricing will be developed such that it can be marketed first within California and then nationwide by a network of resellers. A successful product will be measured by its effectiveness in closing the gap between native and non-native English speakers, at scale. This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to search and understand documents across domains. It is a powerful tool for consumers and businesses to route, categorize and ensure key points of a document are seen. This makes it easy for overwhelmed users to search, link topic information to knowledge bases and extract customized data, even if they can&apos;t think of the right keywords. Online search can infer the popularity or relevance of a page based on data from millions of users, including a user&apos;s location and what they&apos;ve shown interest in; however, business users don&apos;t benefit from these features. Users view concepts in a summary linked to a knowledge base, allowing them to see summaries, triage documents on mobile devices, write rules to sort or filter them automatically, and see key data before ever opening the document. This Phase II project improves information extraction systems by generating answerboxes from complex documents. Consumers will be able to quickly get the gist of formal documents such as consumer credit contracts, insurance policies, industry solicitations, engineering and other difficult-to-read documents. This innovation advances knowledge discovery, information retrieval methods, information extraction, slot-filling, and knowledge-base population. This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II Project discovers unsupervised and unrestricted slots and fillers (attributes and values) to construct structured summaries based on keywords and underlying patterns in document collections. It extends the state of the art by not requiring a manually crafted catalogue of slots and complements supervised approaches by discovering new slots. While conventional Natural Language Processing (NLP) approaches are effective on well-formed sentences, the techniques described here are effective for semi-structured content such as section headers, lists and tables. Additionally, NLP based approaches for fact extraction and text summarization are primarily lexical, requiring further processing for disambiguating and linking to unique entities and concepts in a knowledge base. This approach further advances the state of the art by eliminating these steps as it identifies keywords and links to knowledge base concepts as a first step in the discovery process. This concept-linking enables terms to explicitly map to semantic concepts in other ontologies such that they are available to enable reasoning and understanding. This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will pilot field test controlled release polymers (CRPs) as an in situ chemical oxidation (ISCO) remediation material. With a controlled time release of the oxidant payload, the CRPs technology treats contaminated water over longer periods eliminating the occurrence of contaminant rebound resulting in overall shorter cleanup time and total cost. ISCO is the fastest growing field among sub surface contaminant remediation technologies. Current commercial ISCO deployment methods utilize liquid oxidants as reagents which possess short term reactivity (days). To address contaminant rebounding, these injectable formulations require costly re-injections. This project would result in a novel product that is environmentally benign and achieves sustained release of oxidative agents over extended treatment periods (months to years) with a single application. CRPs are a novel technology, offering a highly tunable remediation amendment for the $1.4B Chemical Treatment Remediation Market. Ultimately, CRPs based treatments will decrease exposure to groundwater contaminants known to cause many human health disorders. The technical objectives in this Phase II research project will be to field test CRPs patented, controlled release polymer technology for in situ chemical oxidation of contaminated groundwater. To support field testing, a pilot scale manufacturing process for the initial minimum viable product established in Phase I will be developed. Manufacturability will be tested in terms of product quality and stability, throughput, and cost. CRPs formulations based on multiple oxidants, will be manufactured to address a broad range of environmental contaminants including chlorinated solvents, BTEX (benzene\/toluene\/ethylbenzene\/xylene), PAH (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons), MTBE (methyl tert-butyl ether), and petroleum hydrocarbons. CRPs will be pilot tested at two field sites with impacted soil and groundwater. The rate and duration of oxidant delivery and contaminant degradation will be measured. In particular, pilot field testing will assess the ability of CRPs to eliminate rebounding. Field data and computation modeling will be used to create a remediation design tool to prescribe future CRP dosing deployment strategies. Collectively, this Phase II program will result in a clear understanding of in-field performance of the CRPs technology to guide future full scale deployment and market uptake.

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this project is its capability to create a positive impact on current and future wireless systems. Multifunctional reconfigurable antenna (MRA) technology targeted in this project enables a single antenna element to dynamically change its frequency band, radiation pattern and polarization properties, which directly impact the radio-frequency (RF) coverage, capacity, and quality of service achieved by any wireless network. Machine-to-machine communications, Internet of Things applications, satellite communications, radar-based sensing, and tactical military communications are just a few of the areas that will benefit from the results of this work. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop and commercialize MRA arrays for use in 802.11ac\/ax WLAN systems and 5G mm-wave systems based on new radio specifications. 5G systems require exploitation of massive multiple input multiple output (MIMO) technology with a large number of antennas to attain significantly improved spectral efficiency, thereby achieving required network capacities and enhanced connectivity. Massive MIMO is also needed to overcome severe propagation losses in mm-wave bands, where large swaths of spectrum is available. If a MIMO system uses legacy dumb antennas with fixed properties, the resulting complexity and cost figures, and the power consumption associated with a large number of RF front ends render them commercially prohibitive. The MRA array technology delivers 3-10 dB higher array gain compared to legacy arrays. Such gains can be used to improve RF coverage, increase user throughput, and reduce network costs by lowering the number of RF nodes or reduce the cost, size and power consumption of access point equipment by lowering the number of antenna elements. This project will deliver the beta prototypes of two MRA array modules containing the hardware and control algorithm that can be seamlessly integrated with WLAN and 5G small-cell modems.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is aimed to develop and commercialize an extendable\/retractable telescopic structural wall for flood protection. This technology will enable more resilient infrastructure in flood-prone areas. Coastal cities and riverine communities are vulnerable to flooding hazards. These population centers tend to be located near bodies of water, and finding the space to accommodate increasing populations, as well as hazard-resilient infrastructure, represents a challenge for city officials and the engineering community in general. The commercial opportunity of the technology lies on the increasing worldwide need for flood protection. In fact, the World Bank estimates that 50 billion dollars a year will be spent worldwide in measures to mitigate this hazard. In U.S. only, floods are considered one of the costliest and deadliest natural hazards with an estimated 7.9 billion dollars in damages and 82 fatalities per year. This technology, when developed, will provide a paradigm shift for the prefabricated concrete industry. It will also develop and validate new methods for telescopic interconnection of structural elements. The intellectual merit of this project lies in a unique concept where structural boxes, made out of fiber reinforced concrete, can be deployed telescopically to withstand forces imposed from external sources, and then return to a retracted position. In Phase I, the feasibility of the concept was demonstrated by the ability of specimens to withstand the forces from three flooding scenarios representative of the targeted market sector: riverine, storm-surges and tsunamis. The Phase II project will focus on assessing the technical features of the walls based on lead-off customer sites. These will include the height of the walls, type of soil, and the hazard assessment, among others technical factors. Studies will be conducted on the local and overall structural response of the walls and the functionality of their mechanical components. Analytical and numerical models will be built and validated with tests on specific components and on full-scale models. The full-scale specimens will be subjected to storm-surges, hurricane, tsunami, slow-rising waters, and impacting debris forces. Robust theoretical framework along with analytical and numerical models and design guidelines will be built to reliably scale and replicate the technology for virtually any site where flood protection is needed."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this project centers on bringing enhanced independence, productivity, and quality of life for hundreds of thousands of individuals in the US who live with severe physical disability due to spinal cord injury or other debilitating neurodegenerative disorders, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Due to improvements in emergency medicine and increasing average age, these individuals represent a growing population that is underserved by current assistive technologies (ATs). The ATs being relied upon to carry out basic tasks are still primitive, offer limited versatility, and fail to meet end-user needs. Meanwhile, computers and internet play ever-growing roles in everyday life and are regarded as equalizers that allow individuals to have similar vocational, recreational, and educational opportunities. The Tongue Drive System (TDS) offers individuals with severe physical disabilities an intuitive and superior mechanism for accessing computer-based resources, wheelchairs, smartphones, smart homes, etc. TDS harnesses the power of the human tongue, which often retains full capability in these individuals despite losses of other functions, to drive human-computer interactions. TDS has the potential to revolutionize the current AT market in the US and around the world with an anticipated market size of $1B within its primary market segment. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase-II project aims to bring this transformative and game-changing AT to market by continuing the design, development, evaluation, and expansion of a robust, reliable, and real-time TDS ecosystem. In Phase-I, the TDS hardware was redesigned and consolidated so that all signal processing functions were self-contained into a new standalone TDS (sTDS) headset system with a dual-band wireless link that can directly interface with a target peripheral by transmitting formatted user-defined commands. In Phase-II the designs for a solid and intuitive user interface, a smartphone app, and a robust and rugged powered wheelchair interface module to effectively control key target devices will be fine-tuned in the final stages of development in preparation for launch. The sTDS hardware\/software\/enclosure will also be tested and ready for manufacturing and meet the FDA regulatory requirements towards submission of a 510(k) premarket notification.

This will involve automating the most technically intensive tasks required to accurately, reliably, and efficiently design and prototype photonic and optoelectronic devices. Current simulation tools require everything to be set up by hand which, even for trained experts, is time consuming and error prone. Also, the computational design and prototyping of photonic devices involves too much trial and error. Our turn-key, on-demand, cloud platform will: (1) reduce design time by 50%, (2) lower the unit cost of simulations by an order of magnitude, and (3) enable first-time users with no prior training in electromagnetic simulations to get up and running with manufacturing-ready designs in a matter of weeks not months. Our advanced simulation tools will facilitate enterprises and entrepreneurs with bringing products to market in a variety of industries critical to national security, health, and education. Easy-to-use and affordable design tools will also reduce the need to fabricate and test as many iterations thereby conserving environmental resources. This is the next generation of computer-aided design (CAD) tools to accelerate photonics innovation and discovery. The proposed project involves the development of a turn-key, electromagnetic, simulation platform which automates complex, multi-step tasks involved in the design and prototyping of photonic and optoelectronic devices. Photonics, the science of light, underlies critical technologies in telecommunications, networking, photovoltaics, biomedicine, photolithography, imaging, displays, and solid-state lighting. Phase II involves automating the deployment of finite difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations in four key areas: (1)large-scale shape optimization for devices involving tens to hundreds of degrees of freedom, (2) sensitivity analysis to assess the impact on device performance of manufacturing errors and predicting manufacturing yields, (3) launching simulation jobs using on-demand, scalable, high-performance computing (HPC) in the public cloud, and (4) seamlessly importing and exporting planar device geometries based on the standard Graphic Database System (GDSII) file format widely supported by electronic design automation (EDA) tools and semiconductor foundries. This will be made possible by combining advances in machine learning, nonlinear optimization, and computational electromagnetics."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project lies in its potential to develop a new mechanism for painlessly terminating atrial fibrillation. Cardiac arrhythmia is one of the leading causes of death and debilitation. A common means of terminating harmful rhythms is delivering a shock via an external or implantable defibrillator. The pain from the shock is the number one concern for patients with implantable defibrillators, and because of the pain, an implantable option is not practical for atrial fibrillation. The high-risk, high-reward research to be conducted under this project will significantly advance the field of defibrillation therapy and aims to lead to the introduction of a new class of implantable medical device technology. The proposed project seeks to develop and evaluate an implantable device that achieves non-destructive temporary conduction delay in cardiac tissues for the painless termination, and potentially prevention, of life threatening arrhythmias. Cardiac arrhythmias are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the developed world. More than 1,000 Americans die each day from sudden cardiac arrest. The team intends to initially target the development of a device to achieve rapid and painless termination of life threatening arrhythmias to treat atrial fibrillation. The successful development of the proposed device has the potential to benefit millions of patients. Additionally, by virtue of its painless modulation of arrhythmogenesis, the proposed device may well also terminate incipient arrhythmias. The phase II project will develop and evaluate a prototype system. It is anticipated that the project will result in a new implantable medical device that painlessly terminates atrial fibrillation. This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the creation of a new tool that could prevent the loss of sensitive data stored in big data management systems due to cyber-attacks. Furthermore, the proposed cybersecurity tool can allow organizations to audit their big data usage to prevent data misuse and comply with various privacy regulations. Recent attacks have shown that the leakage\/stealing of stored data may result in enormous monetary loss and damage to organizational reputation, and increased identity theft risks for individuals. Furthermore, in the age of big data, protecting the security and privacy of stored data is paramount for maintaining public trust, and getting the full value from the collected data. The company&apos;s proposed tool will potentially have significant impact by addressing these important societal needs with respect to big data security and privacy. Based on customer discovery findings, this tool will also address an important customer need found in many different industries and has the potential to have significant commercial impact as more and more companies are adopting big data technologies. This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will commercialize a novel big data privacy, security and governance management tool that provides efficient data sanitization, attribute-based access control, accountability and governance policy enforcement capabilities for protecting sensitive data stored in big data management systems. In addition, the proposed product will provide novel data sensitivity aware intrusion detection capabilities. The Phase II research objectives are: 1) to develop an efficient attribute-based access control framework to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data; 2) to develop data sanitization capabilities for complying with various regulations; 3) to develop a scalable audit log capture, storage and querying framework for increasing accountability for big data usage; and 4) to develop a data sensitivity aware intrusion detection framework to quickly detect potential attacks against sensitive data. These objectives pose significant research challenges with respect to scaling to big data without impacting the existing workflow of the companies. The company proposes to address these challenges by using novel code injection techniques combined with risk aware audit log generation and data sensitivity aware machine learning based intrusion detection techniques. This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project has the potential to help enhance disease resistance in poultry and increase yields due to the delivery of only healthy, fully vaccinated chicks to farms. These healthier chicks will reduce the need for antibiotics in poultry, aiding to combat antimicrobial resistance. This technology has immediate applications in other food animal industries and fisheries, and allows for data capture on numbers of animals and types of treatments given. Broader applications would include any image capture and analysis that relies on analytics to identify target areas for delivery of substances to live animals or humans. This SBIR Phase II project will allow for the advancement and commercialization of imaging technologies for the use of screening and targeting live animals. This proposal brings innovation in the care of food animals allowing for producers to move away from flock health and focus on the care of individual animals. This will be a dramatic change for the poultry industry, but is necessary in the face of antibiotic removal to be able to improve the current vaccination efficiencies and screen chicks for health status. Individualized care is currently not possible due to the high throughput needed to keep pace with large scale commercial hatchery operation. The technical challenges this proposal will overcome include 1) the safe and effective handling of chicks in an automated system that can process 100,000 chicks per hour, 2) the development of imaging systems for health checks and target recognition, 3) the delivery of the appropriate dose of vaccine with the correct amount of agents (virus, bacteria, parasite, and other agents) while not damaging the agents during delivery, and 4) development of a system that is rugged and robust enough to survive in a hatchery environment."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is an improvement in how artificial limbs (prostheses) are fitted to the individual user. This promises better rehabilitation outcomes for people with limb loss, which lowers the risk of long-term health issues, such as accidental falls, back pain, or conditions that are associated with a sedentary lifestyle. All those risks can carry substantial direct and indirect costs for the individual and the society at large. There are approximately 2 million Americans who are living with limb loss, and who will potentially benefit from better prosthesis fit. Beyond the expected long-term benefits, these individuals will experience immediate benefits that include a more inconspicuous gait pattern, a reduction in skin and muscle soreness, and an increase in activity radius. The commercial impact of this research will extend to the industry of prosthetic componentry manufacturing. Currently, the structural elements of prostheses are mass-produced, strictly mechanical components. The proposed work will entail the integration of miniature sensors into those components, which will make them more valuable, and - along with the economical long-term benefits - justify higher unit prices and thereby a substantial growth potential for this $400M market. The proposed project is focused on optimizing the static alignment of limb prostheses. This alignment needs to be carefully fine-tuned to each individual user of a prosthesis. The associated work is the domain of the prosthetist, who depends on experience, patient feedback, and intuition to achieve acceptable results. There are currently no easy ways to measure and track alignment changes throughout this process and therefore no data-based approaches to improving it. In the proposed project, small scale sensors will be integrated into the conventional alignable prosthesis components. These will provide continuous, accurate real-time measurements of alignment changes. It is planned to make those measurements available to the prosthetist via smartphone or tablet PC, so that they can help streamline the alignment optimization process. In the future, if it is possible to analyze the so collected data from thousands of alignment procedures, scientific methods can be applied to solve the problem of imperfect prosthesis alignments. The proposed work will be focused on customizing the sensors and associated hardware to existing standard components without making them much heavier or more expensive. Preliminary tests of the device with a sample of prosthetists are part of the planned Phase 1 project as well."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to develop a new class of cancer therapeutics that involves the re-directing of the body&apos;s pre-existing immune response obtained through previous childhood vaccination to target tumor cells for cancer eradication. Globally, cancer continues to be a top 5 leading cause of death resulting in a high unmet need for novel therapies and treatments. Immune checkpoint inhibitor drugs have emerged as a potent solution with demonstrated clinical benefits. However, such treatments are expensive and toxic, and up to 70% of cancer patients do not respond to such drugs due to the absence of an anti-tumor response. In contrast, the proposed strategy tailors the patient&apos;s tumor to become susceptible towards their own pre-existing childhood vaccine immunity. This approach will change treatment outcomes for many cancer patients previously un-targetable by current immuno-therapeutic drugs. This also circumvents the risky and costly R&amp;D challenges in identifying and\/or producing potent immune responses against cancer. This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a platform technology to mobilize immunity generated from childhood vaccines and re-direct this activity towards tumors to eradicate cancer. This will be done via two development aims. The first aim will demonstrate the ability of the proposed technology to mobilize existing childhood vaccine responses from mice (with relevant human genetics) vaccinated with childhood vaccines (MMR, HepB, Chickpox vaccines). The second aim will be to test whether cancers with known metastasis challenges, such as ovarian and breast cancer, may be eradicated. Specifically, mice will be vaccinated with an appropriate childhood vaccine, then injected with relevant syngeneic tumors. Once the tumor is established, the proposed therapeutic will be injected to see if it can induce pre-existing immunity developed from the childhood vaccine and redirected towards the tumor. Therapeutic effect will be assessed based on the number of metastases and tumor weight\/volume. If successful, this platform will provide both tumor specificity and broad applicability to a wide variety of cancers."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to help identify people that have paroxysmal or asymptomatic cardiac arrhythmias before they become dangerous. Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia, and the prevalence of AF increases with age. AF has a profound impact on longevity and quality of life. Patients typically develop paroxysmal, short-lived episodes of the arrhythmia and are frequently asymptomatic. This often leads to delays in diagnosis of AF until later stages when the arrhythmia is more persistent. Even short episodes of paroxysmal AF are associated with increased risk for stroke, heart failure, hospitalization, and death. The population with undiagnosed AF is substantial and studies have shown that continuous ECG monitoring for more than 3 years is required to achieve close to 100% AF detection. Current 30-day monitors detect 5% of paroxysmal and asymptomatic cases, since events must occur while the monitor is being worn. An armband-based approach offers a way to overcome the current restrictions in chest based monitors and bridges the gap between short-duration 30-day monitors and long-term implanted monitors. The proposed project uses an armband-based device to capture electrocardiogram (ECG) and electromyogram (EMG) signals on the upper arm using a waterproof and wireless device. The sensors are made from a composite material that can operate both wet and dry and does not require adhesives or hydrogels to capture all aspects of the waveforms. The challenge with the upper arm is that the ECG signals have less magnitude then over-the-heart and it is necessary to remove motion \/ noise artifacts as well as EMG signals to create a clean ECG signal. The research is focused on embedding algorithms into the device and testing and refining them for removing motion and noise artifacts that are captured by an accelerometer and to remove EMG signals. After a clean signal is established, proven algorithms for classification of the arrhythmias can be run embedded in the device."

The ML tools employed estimate the degree of reliability for each of the data elements as they are collected and integrates these signals to provide an accurate, individualized risk estimate of patient health over time in order to best guide patient treatment and allocation of hospital resources. Our initial target condition is sepsis, one of the most costly and most deadly diseases in hospitals. This grant develops an end-to-end system to provide risk assessment and implementation of timely treatment. For commercial potential, the underlying core technology can be extended to other clinical scenarios. The proposed project enables scaling of high-precision state-of-the-art Bayesian machine learning techniques that forecast the chance of acute deterioration. This includes tackling the challenges in scaling this machine learning system to function across many care providers, patients, and hospitals. To achieve these goals, this project will develop new methods for running machine learning algorithms in a distributed fashion in cloud computing settings, especially in distinguishing where multiple machines need to coordinate, and arguably more importantly, where they can avoid coordinating in training on data. Further, the project develops software to provide information back to providers so as to enable interventions that can alter patient trajectory. Here the software will encompass how to best use the resulting inferences in guiding care."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to develop specialized cell culture plates that can provide dynamic optical stimulation of cells during kinetic ion channel drug screening assays. The proposed cell stimulation technology is expected to improve the efficiency of drug discovery, and lead to more promising drug candidates with a wide range of mechanisms of actions. Since effects of drugs often depend on functional states of drug targets, in vitro high-throughput assays must be able to re-create different functional states during drug screening. Currently, screening assays acquire the data either from one functional state or an ensemble average of heterogeneous states, which is not representative of in vivo settings. The proposed microplate-based cell stimulation technology will help drug discovery companies to introduce more efficient drugs faster while reducing the development costs, because the proposed technology can dynamically &quot;cycle&quot; ion channel drug targets through different functional states while evaluating drug effects in kinetic assays. These minimally-invasive all-optical assays will have increased information content and enhanced predictive values. This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop nanotechnology-based optoelectronic microplates that can serve as a light-controlled actuator enabling dynamic optical stimulation of cells for all-optical drug screening assays. Current cell stimulation technologies require either genetic modifications of cells (which can affect the drug screening results) or electric-field stimulation (which requires specialized instrumentation and can damage cells). The proposed technology is a non-invasive optical stimulation plate-based platform that can work on genetically and structurally intact cells, and will be compatible with existing screening instruments. The research plan in the material science area covers the development of protocols for deposition of graphene materials and comprehensive characterization of graphene-coated microplates in cell-free and cell-based modes. The biological research plan includes the development of all-optical screening assays that incorporate graphene-coated microplates for enabling optical stimulation. Specifically, the goal is to focus on calcium imaging assays for L-type voltage-gated calcium ion channels that will be &quot;cycled&quot; through different functional states by light illumination using optoelectronic plates. The validation process will include the evaluation of pharmacological effects of known state-dependent calcium channel blockers. It is anticipated that optoelectronic microplates will be compatible with existing cell culture protocols and imaging instrumentation."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to ultimately increase the number of women in STEM careers, thus allowing women to secure higher paying jobs and to expand global innovation by increasing the number of women who are inventing future technologies. Research demonstrates a direct connection between play and academic pursuits, yet few STEM products appeal to the 10MM+ pre-adolescent U.S. girls. Our hypothesis is that by designing an Internet of Things (IoT) platform of interactive decor building kits with motion and lighting features, we can engage girls in hands-on STEM learning during a formative time in their emotional and intellectual development. The kits will offer educational and exploratory opportunities including spatial and sequential thinking, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and programming. The user guides and on-line learning modules will be authored and designed to create and build a STEM identity in girls. Our theory is that this hands-on experience will create attitudinal and identity shifts in girls to motivate them to pursue additional STEM academic opportunities and further their exploration with other STEM activities. The proposed project is a method to provide an entrance to STEM experiences for a population typically not recognizing their strengths and abilities in the STEM areas. This is accomplished by leading them through an IoT modular product platform to build personalizable decor accessories as they pursue their interest in decorating and the arts. The proposed project?s objectives are: (1) design and build a hardware prototype; (2) design and build an app prototype; (3) design and conduct research to determine that interaction with the proposed IoT modular platform results in an attitudinal shift toward STEM. The project will employ research methods including a large scale learning styles survey (400 users); moderated and recorded user feedback sessions, and in-person studies (15 users) using questionnaires adapted from published research and academic assessments. Our success parameters are: (1) 50% of users can build and program the IoT product; (2) 20% of girls experience an increase in STEM areas; (3) 15% improvement in short-term recall of STEM skills and vocabulary; (4) 25% of users report an interest in trying another STEM experience; (5) 50% of users report they would display completed product in their room."

For the first time, hypertensive individuals will have access to a comfortable, non-contact, continuous blood pressure monitoring device that allows for seamless blood pressure measurement without disturbing the user in any way. With 1 out of every 3 adults in the United States living with hypertension, The proposed innovation will meet an important need to monitor blood pressure continuously and noninvasively, thereby providing new insight into how one&apos;s blood pressure responds to medication, exercise, diet, and their actions. Longer term, the data collected by the team will yield unprecedented insight into short and long-term blood pressure rhythms and has the potential to revolutionize personalized medicine for hypertension. This technology is expected to empower people with the feedback that they need to understand what works for them as an individual to maintain their health. The proposed project will lay the ground work for the development of a continuous-wear blood pressure monitoring device suitable for everyday use. Through an RF sensor that can detect arterial movement, the proposed technology can measure cardiovascular parameters for every heartbeat. To date, a prototype sensor has shown significant promise at providing accurate blood pressure measurements in a small sample. Beyond blood pressure information, the fundamental capability of the proposed technology is to measure arterial stiffness, a critical indicator of cardiovascular health. With the support of this NSF grant, the team is expected to develop its technology and ready it for commercialization. The goal for this project is to: (1) eliminate first-surface reflections and micro-motion artifacts related to RF sensing; (2) refine blood pressure algorithms and compare measurements against gold standard BP measurements in healthy, hypotensive, and hypertensive populations. The proposed technology could become an important scientific tool to aid the advancement of cardiovascular research, enabling researchers and clinicians alike to gain further understanding of cardiovascular-related health parameter."

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase I project serves a national need for stronger career readiness by connecting youth to project- and work-based learning experiences that will help them to apply and extend classroom learning. These experiences will increase their career self-efficacy and skills, and help them to develop a critical understanding of careers and the work environment, at an age when it matters the most?before they become disengaged and potentially disconnected from school and work. This investment in career readiness also reduces the societal costs associated with millions of youth that are currently disengaged and marginalized. The cost of this disconnection in the United States is staggeringly high; one study estimates the annual cost to taxpayers for addressing its direct negative effects to be $26.8 billion. Successful and widespread adoption of this project will increase the pool of qualified applicants for employers in industries across the U.S., especially in STEM fields for which there are two to three million unfilled positions due to a shortfall in qualified candidates. By helping youth to engage in meaningful career-related learning experiences this project will have the broader economic impact of increasing their likelihood to stay in school, find good employment, and contribute to the country&apos;s vitality over the long-term. The project combines compelling youth-centered visual and interactive design with analysis of open labor data, personal user data from individual and aggregate usage, and empirically-tested career development inventories. Users explore a range of career pathways and career readiness competencies, as well as recommendations for both proprietary and third party career education content and programs. The project consists of a cross-platform app that allows users to build a profile, explore STEM and other industries of interest, and gain understanding of the relevancy of key career readiness practices. Through data generated by usage, simple assessments and self-reflections, the user profile is strengthened and more specific careers can be explored through leveled online and real-world activities. The project also includes a web-based reporting dashboard that tracks usage and performance data. The project will address the technical hurdles for both the young user to identify meaningful project and work-based activities, and for public and private providers of such activities to reach more youth and improve the impact of their programs. The research team will design surveys, conduct usability tests and analyze usage data to gather evidence against impact criteria. These data will inform an iterative design process for improved user-experience, algorithm adjustments and feature improvements."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this project is improved navigation outcomes for blind and visually impaired (BVI) persons, approximately 285 million people worldwide according to World Health Organization (WHO) estimates. Orientation and Mobility (O&amp;M) is very challenging for the BVI persons, and is rated as one of their two most significant stressors. The company aims to commercialize a promising new assistive technology that utilizes advanced haptics (communication via touch) to enable new powers of navigation for BVI persons. The technology will be a noninvasive and wearable device that combines high-definition haptics with GPS and embedded, Bluetooth-enabled orientation hardware to aid BVI users to navigate to both familiar and new destinations. The technology strategy overcomes the deficiencies of other BVI waypoint assistive technologies by more fully exploiting the skin?s sensory capacity and by utilizing embedded orientation hardware to provide continuous navigation feedback between GPS signals. The company?s goal is to provide a robust, haptic navigation solution with a form factor and price point that makes the technology accessible to the widest possible number of BVI persons, including congenitally and late blind users, the visually impaired and legally blind. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will research the feasibility of leveraging new insights into haptics to improve Orientation and Mobility (O&amp;M) outcomes for the millions of people who suffer from blindness and visual impairment. The company?s proprietary technology is a novel and innovative strategy that combines intuitive, high-definition haptics, customized GPS, and embedded orientation hardware to deliver a superior and practicable solution for BVI navigation. In contrast to other, currently available haptic navigation technologies, which utilize unintuitive and\/or unsophisticated haptic feedback, this new technology incorporates refined and varied feedback that provides the user with intuitive and accurate navigation information. By coupling GPS with Bluetooth-enabled, embedded orientation hardware, the strategy delivers a continuous stream of navigation feedback without any gaps in coverage. The project?s key technical challenges are increasing navigation accuracy, optimizing haptic language algorithms, and reducing the technology form-factor\/scale. The project team plans to mitigate or eliminate GPS false-reads by investigating the use of sensor fusion and dew point collection to improve the fidelity of BVI user location. Haptic algorithms will need to be reworked and optimized for use in a cost-effective, multi-actuator device with a form\/factor that presses firmly yet comfortably on the wrist."

Although the first focus is on utilization for efficient delivery of antimicrobial and antifungal crop protection chemicals, this platform can be applied for actives and biologicals with other functionalities. The broader significance of this research and development effort entails the following aspects: First, in addition to agricultural crop protection products, the delivery system developed here is expected to find commercial applications in many products targeted to the consumer, construction markets, and healthcare. Second, the formulation of benign small structures that have the potential to replace a wide range of persistent and harmful nanoparticles in various industrial settings will enhance scientific and technological understanding of scalable processes on the nanoscale. Third, the sustainable solutions developed in this project could strengthen existing natural resources, enhance biosecurity of the U.S. food supply, and improve public health. This SBIR Phase I project proposes to engineer an innovative system for efficient delivery of agricultural actives. To increase productivity, current agricultural practices utilize large amounts of crop protection chemicals. However, the intensive use of agrochemicals creates environmental threats damaging natural resources and potentially causing climate change. To address these challenges we are developing innovative, breakthrough platform technology with potential to increase efficiency of farming with the same or fewer inputs, while protecting the environment. The goal of this work is to create a new class of scalable, functionally active, sustainable and eco-friendly materials based on the widely available, biodegradable and bio-renewable resource lignin. The first objective of the project is to build a continuous flow process for preparation of lignin particles functionalized with small amounts of active biocides. This research will establish feasibility for continuous formulation of these preparations. The second objective of the study includes characterization of the new formulations using a series of antimicrobial and antifungal assays. As a result of the Phase 1 effort, technical risk will be reduced by identifying the most promising formulations for field studies to be conducted in Phase 2."

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase I project aims to develop a novel blood diagnostic to detect unruptured intracranial aneurysms (IA) in asymptomatic patients. About 2-5% of the U.S. population (about 6-17 million Americans) have an unruptured IA, and these individuals are largely asymptomatic and thus unaware of the potential danger they are in. Currently, no good screening tools to identify patients with unruptured IAs exist. As a result, about 30,000 Americans suffer IA rupture each year without warning, 10-15% of whom die on the way to the hospital and another 30-40% of whom die within a month. The diagnostic screening technology developed in this project will identify people who have unruptured IAs, thus enabling patients to be monitored and receive preventative treatment, which can drastically reduce the rate of rupture. In addition to the health benefits of this non-invasive test, it will also result in massive savings for the healthcare system. The estimated lifetime healthcare costs for annual cases of patients with ruptured IA is about $3 billion, and more than $885 million for patients with unruptured IAs. Plus, the annual lost wages of surviving ruptured IA patients and their caretakers combined is an estimated $138 million. This project aims to develop a molecular diagnostic to detect biomarkers of unruptured aneurysms using the transcriptomes of circulating neutrophils. Preliminary results have shown that circulating neutrophils isolated from blood samples could be used to predict unruptured IA presence with 80% accuracy. This Phase I project will increase the sample size of the previous discovery and validation cohorts to give more confidence in the discovered biomarkers as well as increase the accuracy of the proposed diagnostic. Transcriptomes of neutrophil RNA from patients with and without aneurysms will be obtained through next-generation sequencing. The transcriptome data will be used to further develop biomarker models by employing a machine learning pipeline that uses supervised learning combined with 10-fold cross-validation to prevent over-fitting. The created biomarker models will be validated using neutrophil RNA expression from an independent cohort of patients. Predictive accuracy of 90% with an AUC greater than 0.80 will be used to measure success. Furthermore, to established feasibility of assessing the biomarkers via an inexpensive test, differential expression of biomarker genes will be tested using RT-qPCR, a cheaper, more facile technique than RNA sequencing."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will be the development of high-performance all-carbon reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) column packing material. Customers of the $1.3 Billion\/year HPLC column market include life science, biochemical, industrial, nutritional safety, environmental, agricultural, process engineering, academic and governmental organizations. Reversed-phase columns account for the majority of HPLC column market. Upon market entry, our technology will attract customers whose analysis requirements fall outside the capabilities of current silica- (Hydrophobic alkyl chains typically comprising of 18 carbon atoms (C18) bonded to silica support) or graphitic carbon-based columns as well as those who are seeking faster more efficient analysis at a lower cost. It will also attract customers seeking next-generation performance capabilities for separation of structurally similar compounds, biologics, biobetters or biosimilars. Molecules would include geometric isomers and diastereoisomers (e.g., chiral drugs such as thalidomide), biogenic (e.g., catecholamines or other hormones that are modulated in many neurologic disorders such as Alzheimer Disease). Macromolecules include structurally similar compounds (e.g., hemoglobin variants in sickle cell anemia) and many drug metabolites (e.g., glucuronide in opioid metabolites) and drugs of abuse (e.g., cannabis). This SBIR Phase I project proposes to establish the technical feasibility of a chemically-crosslinked all carbon column material for reverse phase HPLC. Chromatography technology plays a key role in the development of life-saving pharmaceutical products and medical therapies, ensuring the safety of our food and water, protection of our environment and guarding public health. Reversed-phase HPLC columns employ a hydrophobic stationary phase. Typical silica-based reverse phase HPLC columns are not durable, are challenged by elevated pH and temperature and lack sufficient retention for highly polar and closely related structures. The newer graphitic carbon HPLC columns are prohibitively expensive and neither scalable nor functionalizable for improved selectivity. Our technology&apos;s key differentiator is at the molecular surface level, where our novel proprietary fabrication technology directly connect carbon nanomaterials with covalent bonds, producing scalable all-carbon column materials. Our overall objective during Phase I is to identify the optimal column packing conditions and characterize the chromatographic performance of the columns as a function of pH and temperature and ability to separate structurally similar small compounds and biologics. Successful completion of the proposed research and development plan will allow us to finalize highly differentiated all-carbon nanomaterial column prototypes that will offer unparalleled chemical and thermal stability, best-in-class recovery, excellent separation efficiency and increased column longevity at a significantly lower cost."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to provide spoof-free biometric fingerprint sensors. Consumer confidence in adopting many technologies such as IoT devices, and reach a cash-less society is limited by our confidence in transactions being fraud-free. Around the world, there are varying degrees of fraud and it is well known that poorer countries have higher levels of fraud then more advanced countries. By providing a trustable biometric device, the proposed commercialization plan will allow lower levels of fraud and allow greater degree of economic activity bringing up standards of living. The technology of GHz ultrasonics for sensing also has the potential for to be used for applications in being able to image baby fingerprints, enable fingerprint readers in fire-arms for authenticated use at very fast speeds, and allow integration with credit and debit cards. The success of the commercial activities will create a new paradigm for trusting the electronic economy. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop revolutionary new biometric sensors. Biometric technologies range from sensing the unique patterns of the eyes, to voice, and fingerprints amongst other markers. Capacitive fingerprint sensors, and optical fingerprint sensors are very commonly found in smartphones and desktop applications. These technologies produce images that are often limited in resolution and are not spoof-proof. For example, optical fingerprint readers can be spoofed by fingerprint images and capacitive fingerprint sensors can be spoofed by skin-like dielectric polymer fingerprint molds. Ultrasonic images offer the potential for detecting tissue material properties that can help identify fake fingerprints. Although many low-frequency technologies for ultrasonic fingerprint sensing are available, very few have made it into the market in large quantities owing to cost, packaging, and insufficient SNR and resolution. In this project the company will extend the frequency of operation to the GHz range to achieve four to eight times the standard industry standard of 500 dpi resolution. Coupled with integrated circuits operating at low voltages, the company aims for integration of the sensors in very thin platforms such as credit cards."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to spark more cybersecurity innovations, by reducing the R&amp;D expenditures via providing fundamental security analytics tools as a service. Global cybersecurity spending is increasing significantly year over year. Enormous R&amp;D resources have been invested in the development of a range of security products to meet this market. However, different security product providers repeatedly build the fundamental security analytics tools and use them to further develop different innovative security solutions. That is a huge waste of R&amp;D resources. The proposed solution reduces the R&amp;D expenditure of customers and lowers the entry bar for the growing cybersecurity market. With the lowered entry bar, the company anticipates that more innovations will be put into practice. As a result, with the increased competition and reduced R&amp;D expenditure, the company expects a reduction in cybersecurity spending by companies and the government. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on malware intelligence, which has been a long-standing as well as increasingly complex cybersecurity problem. Traditional signature based detection and manual reverse engineering approaches can no longer keep up with the pace of increasingly sophisticated obfuscation and attack techniques. The objective of this project is to develop a security analysis tool for malware intelligence by combining the following two unique techniques: &quot;whole-system emulation based dynamic binary analysis&quot; and &quot;deep-learning based binary code similarity detection&quot;. The first technique provides a fine-grained monitor capability to observe the behaviors of malware. The second technique provides the capability of learning and characterizing complex features. By combining these two techniques, the proposed technology will be able to better understand malware and generate actionable intelligence."

Importantly, the development of new PCMs for the passive thermal regulation of electric vehicle (EV) batteries has the potential to increase EV safety, range, and affordability, representing an addressable market currently valued at $87m and that is growing at 20% per year. Validation of these advantages should significantly benefit society by increasing electric vehicle performance and reducing the frequency of expensive battery replacement, thus increasing the adoption of energy efficient vehicles and reducing green-house gas emissions. This project can also result in an increase in the penetration of energy efficient PCM technology in additional markets worth a combined $370m, including building materials, textiles, electronics, and packaging, which can have a large positive economic impact on society. Finally, successful realization of the goals of this SBIR Phase I program will further enable scientific \/ technological understanding of PCMs that are based on organic materials. The intellectual merit of this project is the validation of a new paradigm for a bottoms-up approach to the design, production, and optimization of structurally-well-characterized reactive polyolefins of tunable molecular weight and narrow polydispersity that possess superior performance and stability characteristics as organic phase change materials (PCMs) for waste heat management as compared to conventional paraffin-based PCMs that have remained virtually unchanged for the past half century. To achieve this goal, reactive polyolefins that are the best candidates for commercialization will be identified through optimization of molecular structure, stereochemical tacticity, and the temperature and kinetics of main-chain and side-chain phase transitions. Reaction variables will also be optimized to provide the highest yields of reactive polyolefins under industrially-relevant and scalable process conditions. The development of PCM-modified thermoset resins based on reactive polyolefins will provide access to commercial waste heat management applications that employ physical constructs obtained from casting or injection molding and should benefit from lower production costs, a wider range of applications, and greater long-term stability."

The technology utilizes a circuit-free, atom-based field sensing element that affords absolute measurements of strong fields with high-speed all-optical readout that is free of electromagnetic interference, directly addressing capability gaps in existing technologies relevant to a variety of industries. A broad commercial potential is in fault-detection in condition-monitoring systems for motors and generators, where faults due to occurrences such as over-fluxing or magnetization can lead to major damage, costly repairs and production downtime. The atomic probe addresses an unmet need for reliable, localized measurements up to several Tesla of magnetic field within and surrounding conductive components in rotating machines for early fault detection. The technology also promises to expand capabilities of laboratory measurement instrumentation and contribute to experimental high magnetic field science requiring advanced instrumentation for measurement in the 1 to 100 Tesla range. The extraordinary opportunities for scientific research and technological development represented by investment in high magnetic field laboratories were set out in influential reports of the National Academies of Science (2004 and 2013). The field probe is expected to contribute to this on-going, multi-disciplinary effort. The intellectual merit of this project includes the research and demonstration of key components and capabilities of an atomic high magnetic field probe. The innovation lies in a fundamentally new measurement approach that provides robust, absolute-standard (atomic) measurement and sensing of magnetic fields up to tens of Tesla at high speed and precision with a compact, circuit-free, all-optical sensing element. The probe operates based on atomic physics principles that describe the spectroscopic response of atoms in strong magnetic fields, and quantum-optics phenomena that serve as a practical means to achieve all-optical readout of the atomic spectra, from which information on the magnetic field is obtained. During this project, theoretical atomic spectra in strong magnetic fields will be developed, tested and refined. A vapor-cell probe suitable for sensing strong magnetic fields will be designed, fabricated, and tested. Laboratory experiments will be performed to measure the atomic response to magnetic fields in the range of 1 Tesla at ppm sensitivity levels. The method will also be tested in time-varying and switching magnetic fields, on timescales of "

To unlock the full innovative potential of this phenomenon, self-assembly must be taught to the upcoming generation of scientists and engineers in an engaging and insightful manner. This SBIR Phase I project aims to integrate self-assembly into the teaching curriculum of undergraduate science courses. By educating students about the intricacies and applications of self-assembly, this project will inspire future breakthroughs and accrue compounding societal and commercial benefits. The proposed project aims to prototype a consumer-focused minimum viable product (MVP) that assists undergraduate instructors in teaching the emerging phenomenon of selfassembly. The absence of such a product to date is likely attributable to the technical hurdles that challenge the ability to demonstrate self-assembly in a cross-disciplinary yet straightforward manner. The research objectives incorporate proof-of-concept experimentation and reiterative product builds to design a prototype that efficiently caters to undergraduate instructors and their teaching practices. More specifically, the objectives are to: 1. Design components that demonstrate self-assembly across multiple scales and disciplines. 2. Create educational content that effectively disseminates knowledge of self-assembly and its applications. 3. Field-test and optimize the prototype in response to end user experiences. The resulting MVP will provide materials and instructions to conduct various self-assembly demonstrations in a cost-effective and readily deployable manner. The product would be the first educational tool to address self-assembly in this manner."

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project objective is to overcome weaknesses of current composite materials due to delamination and develop composites with more than 100% improvement in interlaminar toughness. The project aims to accelerate the innovation of epoxy\/resin nanoadditives for composite materials in order to solve this problem. Composites are expected to be the fastest growing application segment in the global epoxy resin market, with an estimated compounded annual growth rate of ~6% and an expected market value of $14.5 billion by 2024. The key drivers in the market are the end-use industries which include aerospace, automotive, transportation, and coatings. There is a critical need to make these materials safer and more reliable by increasing their low velocity impact resistance, and to increase the adhesion between laminar layers. The product could have an obtainable market volume of $36 million in the US alone by 2021. The intellectual merit of this project is in the development of new hybrid nanofillers based on Graphene Oxide (GO) and Polyhedral Oligomeric Silsesquioxane (POSS). These nanofillers can be added to epoxy\/vinyl ester\/polyester matrices through a &quot;Master Batch&quot; process to enhance the interlaminar fracture toughness of commercial composites. This increase in fracture toughness can be more than 100% at extremely low addition levels (~0.2% by weight of the composite) without any changes in current manufacturing processes. Nanofillers such as carbon nanotubes and nanoclays are difficult to add to composite matrices because of their tendency to agglomerate and result in poor dispersion, apart from major changes in current manufacturing practices. Preliminary experiments have demonstrated that it is possible to develop these hybrid nanofillers based on GO and POSS that can be added to composite matrices with excellent dispersion in composite industry standard solvents. The challenges of dispersion are overcome through hybridization and Master Batching. Characterization of the cured Master Batches as well as measurement of physical properties of sample composites will be carried out to optimize the nanofiller content and the processing parameters."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this project is that it will serve as a one-stop power conversion solution across the power conversion industries. The proposed Power Converter can convert power directly from AC-DC, DC-DC, DC-AC and AC-AC in a single stage without an interim AC or DC link. The said power converter can take fixed frequency, variable frequency or DC voltage as input and can deliver another fixed frequency, variable frequency or DC voltage at the output. The voltage can be stepped up or down and the power can flow back and forth in the said power converter. Having all the power conversion features in one hardware can serve almost all power conversion applications such as aircraft\/spacecraft\/ship, hybrid\/electrical vehicle, renewable energy, automation industry and almost all other power conversion needs by a mere change of software. Such technology has a potential to become a mass-produced commodity and in effect the cost of the power converter can be dramatically reduced across all industries, Market research organization has estimated that by 2020, the power converter market will be valued at $65 billion. Therefore, the commercial impact of this one stop power converter solution will be significant. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will introduce a multifunctional power converter with single stage power conversion. By employing bi-directional 4-quadrant wide band gap switch, intelligent filters at input and output, advanced pulse width modulation and commutation scheme a more efficient, robust, smaller foot print, low-weight power converter will be realized which will convert power from input to output much faster with reduced loss and at the same time it will not need any bulky DC or AC link in between. By operating less number of semiconductor switches at a given time the loss and size of the power converter will be reduced. By having intelligent filter, high power quality at the input and output will be achieved. The multifunctional use of this power converter will cut down the number of on board power converters in aircraft\/spacecraft\/ship in a system level which will provide multi-fold benefit in terms of fuel economy. By having less loss, the power consumption will be reduced and by having smaller size and weight the payload will be less, which will improve the fuel economy. By reducing number of on board power converters the on-board weight will be reduced further. Therefore, overall fuel economy will be significantly improved."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to significantly reduce Calculus failure rates. Success in Calculus is a prediction of persistence in STEM degree programs; but many students do not successfully complete Calculus courses. This reduces graduation rates and restricts hiring into STEM careers. Ultimately, this barrier impacts the Presidents call for one million more STEM graduates. When playing Variant, a 3D educational game, students are drawn into an interactive world and gameplay. The game allows students to develop a conceptual understanding of Calculus without reliance on definitions, terminology, formulas, and calculations, via a heuristic, experiential learning environment. Variant assists learners in grasping core concepts in Calculus, which ultimately leads to higher persistence, retention, and graduation rates in STEM degrees. The proposed project is focused on developing the Variant games series for higher education and secondary (grades 9-12) Calculus. Unlike current games and homework platforms that rely on repetitive drills or address lower level mathematical concepts, Variant presents complex experiential explorations. Variant differentiates itself from other games in terms of educational rigor and its 3D environment, that allows students to be more engaged and immersed when learning Calculus content. A stealth assessment will be integrated within the game system to provide real-time feedback and inform development of the instructor portal. Without interrupting the game experience, the stealth assessment measures a players knowledge gain and validates gameplay as a measure of achievement of the student learning objectives."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is the development a scalable, automated, genetic transformation platform that is 10,000X faster than the current state-of-the-art. The fields of synthetic biology and genetic engineering are currently limited by the ability to re-program microorganisms with foreign DNA. There have been significant advances in the synthesis of DNA, screening of genetically engineered microorganisms, and bioinformatics. However, the technology used to deliver DNA and perform genetic transformation has not advanced in a similar way. Phase I of this SBIR will result in a prototype high-throughput genetic transformation platform to demonstrate the utility of the system. This system will allow genetic engineers to more rapidly develop microorganisms for the production of bioengineered chemicals and materials. This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a high-throughput, automated platform for genetic transformation of bacteria using a proprietary flow-through electroporation technology that is fast, reliable, and scalable. A key step in genetic engineering of cells is to introduce the foreign DNA that re-programs the cell. Electroporation, cell permeabilization using pulsed electric fields, is the most efficient and widespread method to deliver DNA into microorganisms for this application. State-of-the-art electroporation involves cuvettes that expose the cells and DNA to uniform electric fields. However, this process is currently slow, labor-intensive, and expensive. The proposed technology can be automated by augmenting existing liquid handling robots, and, when operated in parallel, may improve the genetic transformation rate by up to 10,000X compared to current methods. This will represent a paradigm shift in areas dependent upon genetic transformation where DNA delivery using electroporation is currently a major bottleneck. Ultimately, the goal is to address the need for a high-throughput genetic transformation platform to accelerate innovation in synthetic biology."

This project will employ a craft-oriented approach to STEM education, which breaks down gender barriers and engages students from diverse backgrounds. It is estimated that 65% of primary school children will grow up to work in jobs that do not yet exist. This new workforce will be the result of what is being referred to as the &quot;fourth industrial revolution&quot;, brought on by a fusion of technologies in the physical, digital, and biological spheres. The goal of this project is to develop an ecosystem of IoT technologies that prepare students for these industries. The platform to be developed will disrupt the current commercial landscape by providing an affordable and student-friendly alternative to devices which are either expensive or overly challenging for beginners to adopt. The resulting product platform will serve the global smart education and learning market, which is expected to grow to $586 billion by 2021. The intellectual merit of this project is to develop a &quot;smart&quot; education tool that will enable educators and learners to control the ways in which technology shapes their lives. This innovation will eliminate the major hurdles that create conceptual, practical, and economic barriers for students to gain literacy of information networks and human-centered design. To achieve this goal, the team will research and develop a platform and an easy-to-use device that overcomes the technical challenges of providing IoT experiences in the classroom, where wireless internet is often unreliable, and the security and privacy of students must be safeguarded. The key objectives for this project are 1) to develop a classroom-ready framework for IoT including curriculum that adheres to educational mandates; 2) to design and build low-cost and low-power hardware, firmware, and protocols for the platform; and 3) to design and implement a mobile application to facilitate communications and programming. The anticipated result of this research is a platform that provides K-12 classroom access to IoT tools and skills. The design and manufacture of this project opens up a new market as Bluebird users craft their own IoT ideas, products, and services."

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase I project will fund development and release of a new way of using big data to maximize educational outcomes and the potential of each individual child. The project will create individualized learning paths for every student that dynamically adjusts based on their abilities across thousands of educational topics. The engine adjusts up to find their maximum potential regardless of age or grade, and adjusts down when they are struggling. The simple, yet engaging, games combined with gamification elements will keep the child wanting to play over and over, constantly learning as they go. The project will provide a tool to parents looking to enhance their child?s education as well as to those that prefer to homeschool. It will also be a powerful teacher&apos;s assistant, able to monitor the progress of each child in the classroom so the teacher can better monitor and manage progress of their student base. The Parent and Teacher Portals will connect the classroom and home learning experience and allow both parents and teachers to see how each child is performing and where they need to intervene to help. Over time, the project will test and deploy new ways to learn. The potential commercial market for this product includes parents, homeschoolers, and teachers. The initial target market is kindergarten to 8th grade. The project will improve education outcomes at these crucial ages. The project uses patent-pending technology that combines a set of probabilistic engines to determine the right content for each student based on their individual ability. It does not determine content based on their age or grade and makes no assumptions about what the student can or can?t do. Instead, it allows the student to set their own limits and use Big Data to predict and test optimal learning paths. The learning engine can work with any category of educational content and deliver that content dynamically to any type of game. The project can measure the learning impact by making changes to the traditional learning paths within clusters of students. It will uncover if, for example, fractions should be introduced earlier to all children, or subsets of children. As opposed to the option of skipping a grade or being held back, a student doing well (or poorly) could be in the same class with their peers and still have unique content that challenges them and maximizes their natural abilities. The learning engine will use business intelligence techniques to identify problem areas for each child and recommend what to practice and practice techniques. The project team has previously received patents on technology in the gaming industry, and is confident in the ability to receive a utility patent for this technology for intellectual property protection."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this project is to hasten the deployment of autonomous transportation systems, which stand to reduce driving accidents and fatalities, enable new paradigms in urban design, reduce vehicle traffic, increase automobile efficiency, and improve air quality, benefiting the immediate health of drivers and non-drivers alike. Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are simpler implantations of semi-autonomous controls systems, but are already saving lives by providing intelligent cruise control, lane departure warnings, steering assistance, and preemptive emergency braking. As ADAS improves through advanced sensor hardware developed in this work and becomes more widely deployed, more accident will be avoided and lives saved. Autonomous vehicles are expected to accelerate current trends from private ownership of multiple vehicles to transportation services, such as Uber and Lyft, and autonomous vehicle services, a trend evident in New York city and San Francisco, where parking lot capacity is dropping. As carpool lanes have promoted wiser commuting and reduced congestion, future autonomous lanes can enable platooning, where vehicles travel at reduced distances between each other at high speed, reducing drag, increasing fuel economy, and better utilizing public infrastructure. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will result in a vision system that delivers three dimensional data of objects in view, allowing for the widespread adoption of delivery robots, drones, advanced driver safety systems in vehicles, and autonomous vehicles. To deliver performance and reliability at a cost that enabled wide adoption, the company will address the challenges facing incumbent technologies with two key technological innovations: A high speed, wide angle laser beam steering technology based on magneto-hydro-dynamics, and the use of neutrally buoyant optomechanics. These two innovations allow for light beams to be swept across a wide field of view, delivering 3D point cloud data at high frame rate with operational immunity to vibrations from road hazards such as pot holes and speed bumps. The end objective of the research is to demonstrate a fully functionally imaging system operating with components developed in this work. It is anticipated that the developed components will implement precise spatial control of laser sources by a low cost electromagnetic drive motor, demonstrating performance metrics consistent with deployment on production vehicles."

        "abstract": "The\u00a0broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the innovation of diamond technologies that will enhance the efficiency and reliability of electric vehicles, thus supporting the development of green technology and reduction of CO2 emissions. Specifically, diamond diodes will reduce powertrain losses by about a third and thus directly translate into a 10% increase in electric power vehicle (EPV) range. While the impact of diamond diodes is significant, the development of this technology is also intended to advance diamond power devices. Additional diamond components - such as insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) - will increase the efficiency and reliability of electric vehicles even further. Moreover, the successful commercialization of diamond will ultimately affect many power markets in addition to EPVs: including converters and inverters in geothermal drilling, aerospace, and power grids; high-frequency applications such as radar and communication systems; and extreme environment electronics relevant to the nuclear industry and space exploration, such as the exploration of Venus. The proposed project expects the fabrication of diamond freewheeling Schottky-PIN diodes for EPVs. These devices will utilize lab-grown diamond to produce and test PIN diodes. While growth techniques have recently been developed to enable to the fabrication of such structures, much innovation is still needed to facilitate scalability and commercialization of diamond devices. Therefore, in Phase I, the scope of research will consist of the following activities to make diamond diodes for powertrain converters and inverters in EPVs: (a) demonstrate the expected performance of diamond freewheeling diodes using simulations, (b) control the doping concentrations and thickness of single-crystal diamond layers, (c) develop scalable fabrication and patterning processes for diamond devices, (e) determine electrical characteristics of diamond PIN diodes, and (f) investigate the reliability and possible failure mechanisms of packaged diamond PIN diodes. A significant challenge for diamond devices for power applications will be the achievement of cost parity. Considering the relatively high cost of diamond substrates, an innovative commercialization strategy will be adapted to keep initial costs low, allowing diamond devices to achieve cost parity faster."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this project will occur in the consumer electronics industry. Recent developments in mobile computing and wireless internet have led to an increasing demand for portable computers and smart phones equipped with wireless local area networks (WLAN) operating with multi-standard capabilities. The market for wireless communications systems exceeds 6 billion units per year, and full complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) transmitters promise a common technology platform to enable multi-standard, flexible, robust, integrated, and cheaper solutions. Improving the power efficiency and yield of high-performance power amplifiers (PAs) will have significant impact on the efficiency, reliability, and production cost of radio frequency (RF) transmitters, ensuring sustainable growth of the consumer electronics industry. The PA is responsible for approximately 22% of the overall power consumption of cellular base-stations while cooling represents 13%. For handheld devices, the PA is responsible for around 40% of battery power while transmitting information; hence, more efficient PAs will contribute to the development of greener technologies. Societal benefits will include power savings, more flexible and cheaper wireless communication devices. This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will focus on the design of highly-efficient linear RF transmitters suitable for broadband transceivers implemented in deep submicron CMOS technologies. Its specialized leverage is based on the digital control of PA sections such that the power consumption is fully correlated with the power delivered to the antenna, while the power gain and signal bandwidth are accurately controlled with a simple yet efficient digital algorithm. The research team proposes to develop a digitally-assisted linear PA architecture coupled to the antenna through a 1:3 turns ratio transformer and an optimized impedance matching network to achieve unique power savings of over 60% at moderate and deep back-off power levels. The current management based PA is strategically segmented and automatically optimized for best possible current efficiency. The architecture is flexible and well suited for the emerging IoT markets. For cases where the form factor is not an issue, the architecture can be equipped with a dynamic power supply system to further optimize for power. By incorporating these techniques, average power efficiency levels in the range of 25% at 9 dB back-off power are expected; these PAE levels surpass existing solutions by more than 60%."

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase I project aims to prove the technical feasibility and the economic viability of natural fiber welded and dyed yarns and fabrics. Natural fiber welding is process that swells and mobilizes polymers within natural fibers to create higher performance yarns and fabrics. At sufficiently fast rates, individual fibers are fused and bonded together without glues or resins while retaining a majority of the natural structure and order of natural polymers. This leads to improved mechanical properties while maintaining the benefits of a natural product. Moreover, during the welding process, functional materials and chemistries including dyes, antimicrobials, and flame retardants can be simultaneously locked within yarns and fabrics in new eco-friendly ways. This new ability has potential to displace, for example, present day resource intensive processes such as indigo dyeing for denim which is a water and chemical intensive process that requires significant equipment investment. Inclusion of indigo dye via natural fiber welding processes has tremendous potential to reduce the environmental impact of denim manufacture while saving costs and simultaneously improving the performance of resultant fabrics and with innovative new design effects. This type of disruptive innovation would bring in sustainable US-based manufacturing throughout the value chain of the massive multitrillion dollar per year textile industry. An extremely promising and tunable class of solvents for natural fiber welding processes are called ionic liquids. This project explores several new types of ionic liquid-based solvent systems co-optimized with new automated hardware designs to cost effectively enact natural fiber welding processes with cotton and other natural fiber-containing yarn substrates. In so doing, ionic liquid-based process solvents are recovered in a closed-loop recycling process thereby enabling economic viability as well as creating an eco-friendly manufacturing platform. This project will focus on proving proof of concept with new combinations of ionic liquid(s) and co-solvent(s) to enable concurrent welding with indigo dyeing while developing high efficiency recycling methodologies. There are known methodologies to separate ionic liquids in dilute aqueous solutions but these have not yet been developed for situations where additional miscible co-solvents are present. The objective of this project is to demonstrate natural fiber welding processes that deliver indigo dye into cotton-based yarn substrates while achieving high rates of recycling with process solvents that contain co-solvent(s) and to enable scalable processes for potentially billions of pounds of denim products produced annually."

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase I project is focused on modeling, designing, analyzing, building and testing a prototype commercial superinsulation called High Performance Multi-Layer Insulation (HPMLI). HPMLI is based on a new technology that significantly reduces heat leak, and allows a multilayer insulation to be used in commercial applications. HPMLI could provide R-235 thermal insulation, compared to current state of the art R-6 foam insulation, offering 40-fold lower heat leak into fridges and freezers and reducing energy use. Heating and cooling account for 74% of U.S. residential energy use, with water heaters and refrigerators consuming 26% and $60B in annual costs. This superinsulation, originally developed for NASA and used for spaceflight, could save 90% of energy used for refrigeration and heating appliances, reducing energy costs and protecting our environment. This opportunity is to develop and manufacture a novel ultra-high-performance insulation for use by appliance manufacturers and consumers for improved energy efficiency, and will enable the small business to grow to 17 employees, with $20M in revenue by 2022. This insulation has many potential applications, including home refrigerators, commercial freezers, water heaters, refrigerated trucks and shipping containers, industrial hot\/cold processes, food coolers and buildings. HPMLI is based on novel discrete spacers and radiation barrier layers, forming a new very high- performance insulation. A novel system is proposed in which the spacers self- support the layers against external atmospheric pressure, allowing use in air. Technical challenges must be solved that carefully balance structural support, heat flux, cost and ease of integration into appliances. This insulation is only possible due to the unique properties of the discrete spacers, which must be designed, developed and tested for this application. The goals are to successfully build and test a prototype demonstrating greater than R-200 thermal performance, and able to be vacuum sealed into vacuum panels or appliance case walls. The system will be thermally modeled for several concepts, a spacer design iterated, prototype demonstration units built for a fridge and\/or food cooler, and the heat flux through the insulation measured. HPMLI will be compared to current state of the art foam, and factors required for commercialization considered in this Phase I design."

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase I project will explore the potential benefits of a sine wave shaped wheel compared to a traditional circular wheel for the central pivot irrigation industry. The central pivot irrigation industry is an essential segment of the agriculture industry and this project aims to deliver a superior wheel that solves the persistent issue of trench-digging that leads to equipment breakdown, down time, lost profits, and crop-loss. The broader significance of eliminating trench-digging would be significant savings for farmers, distributors and consumers. Agriculture is the largest industry in the world, and developing a wheel that eliminates an issue that plagues the industry is the central goal of this project. The development of a sine wave wheel also potentially impact other fields as the technology can be used in over one-hundred different industries. The technical innovation of this project is creating a wheel that is non-circular. The wheel will exhibit the blending of multiple shapes in one design including a sine wave, cube, circle and hexagon. It will be approximately 4.5 feet tall, and weighing approximately 400lbs for use in the farming industry. The concept is to create two wheels in tandem where the sine waves are out-of-phase from one another. The front wheel would create a left-right-left path into the soil, much like the path a snake would leave behind traversing soil. The rear wheel would move in an opposite right-left-right configuration leaving a double helix footprint in its wake. The opposing wheels would push the soil back toward center, eliminating the largest issue plaguing the industry: trench digging. The sine wave wheel technology has already been scientifically proven on a smaller scale in the skateboarding industry to reduce friction, increase longevity, increase off-road ability, and increase speed. Multiple wheel iterations will be manufactured and subsequently tested in this project using off-the-shelf hubs within the industry and rubber tires. The wheel will not be pneumatic and will never go flat."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/ commercial potential of this project is to commercialize previous research in tensegrity robots for new markets in disaster rescue, surveillance, scientific monitoring, and STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) education. Future deaths by both victims and first responders in disaster rescue in unchartered risky environments could be prevented by utilizing semi-autonomous technology to explore the regions of disasters, provide surveillance to inform first responders, and assist in the rescue of victims until human first responders can arrive. Current autonomous vehicles can be ineffective in navigating surface obstacles and climbing steep slopes to reach areas of interest. Aerial operations may be limited to dropping supplies, which may not be beneficial if victims are immobile or unconscious. The goal is to drop the proposed shape-shifting robots from aerial vehicles, so that these mobile robots can reach previously difficult areas for effective emergency response. This proposed technology will have broader impact in use for scientific monitoring and surveillance as well. A secondary market will be for K-12 students, teachers, parents and roboticists with the potential to have large impact in STEM education. Robot kits will be developed for educational applications that will meet new Next Generation Science Standards. The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will focus on de-risking prior research in the development of spherical tensegrity structures as a robotic platform for the proposed target applications. To meet market needs, the specifications need to include impact testing from a drop from an aerial vehicle along with ground travel requirements of slope, rubble and speed. New hardware and software will be designed to meet these specifications. The following three control algorithms and actuation schemes will be developed and evaluated for target specifications and tested in simulation and in hardware for locomotion (1) Multi-cable rolling motion on inclined surfaces, (2) Dynamic rolling using Model Predictive Control (MPC), and (3) Deep reinforcement learning. For applications where the terrain has been mapped, a (4) Generative path-planning algorithm will be developed. (5) Control mechanisms for the internal sphere of the robot will be developed so that the tensegrity robot will be able to manipulate and orient a payload of sensing equipment (e.g., camera, ultrasound, infrared, laser, spectrometer) while traveling on rough terrain. (6) Associated sensor validation, fusion and estimation techniques will be developed to meet the specifications. The results will be a proof-of-concept prototype that meets the target specifications."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable students and trainees to take state-of-the-art robotics laboratory classes from anywhere in the world. The proposed learning system is aimed to be incorporated as online courses, with the potential of being attended by more than a million students. The addressable market represents hundreds of millions of dollars considering online courses, secondary schools and industrial training. Laboratory courses in colleges and high schools require students to be physically present next to the equipment. With the proposed remote robotics laboratory, students and trainees can take laboratory classes just turning on their mobile devices or computers. Most importantly, the students can conduct the laboratory tutorials anywhere across the globe and at any time. This technology can be transformative for accessing expensive laboratory equipment not present in many institutions or companies. The system we provide consists of a robotic device currently being used inside NASA robots. Therefore, students using the remote laboratory will learn the use of real-world, state-of-the-art equipment that can be highly valuable for their job careers in STEM fields. The proposed project will solve two key problems in online learning. First, no known commercially available laboratory online course exists that provides students remote hands-on experimentation. The second is that the same content is delivered to all students regardless of their current understanding level. Distributed communications, robotic software and web framework technologies will be integrated to provide access to state-of-the-art laboratory equipment. The second key innovation is the delivery of content adaptively tailored to individual needs. The innovation, consists of three key components. A web framework that connects equipment to servers and personal mobile devices, an intelligent content tutoring system, scheduling usage times and student evaluation regarding skill acquisition and assessments. The team anticipates that being remotely located will be slightly less effective than being next to the equipment but superior than learning theory only."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is the development of potentially the first FDA-approved phage therapeutic, non-antibiotic remedy specifically designed for honeybees. This treatment has the potential to become the global gold standard for treating American Foulbrood, a devastating honey bee disease caused by the bacteria Paenibacillus larvae, which threatens 2.7 million beehives in the United States and 92.5 million beehives worldwide. The American foulbrood treatment market opportunity is $500 M, and this technology promises a significant reduction of current unprecedented mortality rates of honeybees, curtailment of antibiotics being used in beehives, which perpetuates antibiotic resistance in the environment, and support for organic agricultural production. This SBIR Phase I project proposes to expand the collection of Paenibacillus larvae bacterial strains for novel phage therapy development, enlarge the library of P. larvae bacteriophages from which an optimized treatment can be created, and test against each other to determine the optimal therapeutic phage combination. The expansion of the P. larvae strain and phages collection is critical because of the high specificity phages have for their hosts. Samples of P. larvae and phage will be collected from the entire United States. These greatly expanded phage and bacteria collections will help to ensure that treatments will be developed to effectively treat any American foulbrood infection."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the ability to address secure communications with virtually no overhead at reasonable cost. The asynchronous engine developed in this program will enable robust encryption and decryption while offering improvements in power efficiency, data throughput and security. According to SDM, the market for encryption and decryption technology could be as high as $38.5 billion by 2020. Additionally, there is a recognized need for encryption and authentication of power and chemical\/process plants in the U.S., currently dangerously underserved. The initial market is estimated to be $270M and the serviceable addressable market is $2.7B. This program&apos;s primary focus will be on the asynchronous engine for the industrial and data center industries with a total market of $27B. In addition, the proposed technology will be flexible enough to be incorporated into encryption-decryption products in many other industries. These include consumer goods and services, such as mobile communications devices, entertainment and transportation (vehicles, airplanes). This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will address the need for cyber security for Internet-of-Things (loT) systems using an innovative approach: an asynchronous engine using chaotic functions to generate an infinite length key for encryption and decryption. During the past few decades, information has emerged as the most valuable asset for both individuals and corporations. Cyber-attacks no longer exclusively target military or large enterprises; everyone from private citizens to businesses to governments requires secure communications. The methods of encryption rely on digital schemes to encrypt and decrypt messages using general-purpose CPUs and software; which means that loT devices impend hacking of information, system function, corporate profits, and national security. Our unique approach will include a discrete-logic program with reconfigurable chaotic oscillators loaded into a field programmable gate array (FPGA). This hybrid system will be tested with different loT devices and network configurations. The long-term goal of the hybrid encryption-decryption engine is to build a hardware encryption device to secure peer-to-peer communication. The innovative solution will allow the attached device to execute much faster than current solutions of similar complexity while reducing or eliminating overhead, and allowing one-time pad encryption."

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase I project will examine a new ultra-rapid 3D printing technology designed to break down important barriers to the future of Additive Manufacturing. The subject is a machine and materials set that can provide exponentially faster object generation at high resolution. This system leverages several familiar technologies in a new way to provide a path for 3D printing, generally considered reserved for the high-tech sectors, to become accessible to everyone. Because the new method is so rapid, detailed, and the materials are so diverse, it is poised to enhance plastics manufacturing profit margins by eliminating mold costs in many cases. In this way, many American business forced to outsource overseas will be able to maintain domestic production and increase the return of manufacturing jobs to the US. In addition, the manufacturing of the consumables will also enhance job creation. When this new method is fully adopted, its use in the medical field will make lifesaving and life enhancing prosthetic, implantable, and pharmaceutical testing applications much more cost effective, fundable by Medicare, benefiting all our citizens. By servicing a higher percentage of the general plastics manufacturing $600B industry, as well as professional designers, engineers, technical professionals, and the medical and scientific community, the new system in its many forms will eventually be of benefit to nearly every industry in the US, increasing the growth and practical value of the 3D market sector. The subject invention is unique in its use of multiple disciplines simultaneously. As a solid-state system, pressure-biased build material presses up against a glass screen, which is micro-porous, and is laced with the same kind of electronics as are found in flat screen displays. The discrete addressing normally reserved for video images, known as row-and-column refresh rates, is instead used to activate resistive material generating micro-heat spots in this open weave configuration. The heat stimulates the build material to transit the glass and solidify topside, at 1000 dpi resolution, or 1 million droplets per square inch. These high-resolution droplets conjoin and cool, as an entire layer is created at once at 30-120 times a second with no mechanical heads tracking back and forth. The objects should seem to simply appear on the glass at about one to seven vertical inches per minute, depending on the refresh rate, at virtually any planar size, and can be used right away, since no post-curing treatment is needed. Integrating an activated video matrix to build entire cross sections at once, increases speed exponentially. The pores in the glass rely on the known science of Microfluidics, a highly refined means of moving an entire 2D matrix of liquid, to eliminate costly and slow mechanization, and will be studied in this application. Robust and diverse materials have been developed for many embodiments and will be tested. Optimizing first in Multiphysics simulation, and then fabricating a simplified Proof of Concept in Phase I, should provide compelling evidence for continued work on this novel method in Phase II."

Poor code quality leads to bugs which often translate into financial loses and can even endanger human life. A study by NIST estimated software bugs cost $59 billion annually. The key aspect of this project is a programmer-friendly language for describing software fixes. Successful adoption of the language by the programmer community can have a far-reaching positive impact upon the software community: programmers will have a common, formal, language to discuss ways to fix bugs, and the result of their collaboration could be used to automatically fix software systems. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will address the research and technical challenges in providing programmers with a language to express their knowledge of error patterns and their fixes, and a tool that uses this information to check and fix software systems. The research objective is to refine the language such that it is easy to use by programmers, and to provide a scalable infrastructure. This will be achieved by iteratively improving both the language and the supporting infrastructure with feedback from early users. The anticipated result is that the technology will be applicable to a wide variety of bugs and to large code bases."

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase I Project will enable rural areas of the United States and developing nations to leapfrog the need to build natural gas distribution infrastructure. High temperature heat is required to manufacture and process many day-to-day items, including food, clothing, and more. In regions of the world that do not have natural gas infrastructure, factories produce heat by burning petroleum-based fuel - fuel that must be trucked on-site. It gets expensive. This project will develop technology to capture high temperature heat directly from the sun at significantly lower costs than customers are already paying for fuel. It has the potential to spur economic development in rural areas in the US and other under-developed regions around the world by improving access and reducing the cost of high-temperature heat. This project will develop plug-and-play interfaces and techniques to connect advanced new fuel-less boiler technologies to existing \/ legacy thermal systems in commercial and industrial facilities. Current techniques require costly engineering and are prone to failure, forming a key barrier to the adoption of new fuel-less heat sources. This project will develop modular, scalable, and robust techniques to combine fuel-less boilers powered by the sun with traditional boilers powered by fossil fuels. It will include development and testing of both control systems and thermal balance-of-systems. The goal of the project will be to demonstrate integration of an advanced renewable heat source on a live industrial facility. This work is expected to reduce the cost of deploying such technology by 50% or more."

Autoimmune diseases are the number one cause of morbidity for women in the U.S., and one of the top 10 causes of death for women under 65 years old. The annual healthcare burden of these diseases is estimated at more than $100 billion in the U.S. alone. Current treatments for autoimmune diseases are effective for some patients, but a majority either do not respond or become refractory. Furthermore, standard drugs result in systemic immune suppression, which can cause severe and chronic side effects. Hence, there is substantial market need for anti-inflammatory drugs that can act locally at the site of inflammation, and deliver the &quot;right dose at the right time&quot; depending on the severity of the flare. If successful, the adaptive cell therapy platform being developed in this proposal will serve as the basis for a next-generation therapy to existing biologics. This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a cell-based technology that localizes to a site of inflammation, senses inflammatory signals, and triggers the release of anti-inflammatory agents. The substantial technical and clinical progress made in recent years in synthetic biology and cell therapies is enabling development of this type of product. The goal is to design and optimize synthetic gene circuits to program cells to locally sense inflammatory signals such as TNFalpha and release anti-TNF drugs. The plan is to introduce these circuits into adult stem cells that have been used safely in numerous clinical trials against autoimmune diseases and have a well-established commercial development path. The engineered cells will be tested in culture to show input\/output response to different levels of TNFalpha, and then tested in mouse models of disease. If successful, lead candidates will be further developed in a Phase II application."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this project includes a new, low-cost approach to 3D millimeter wave image sensors enabling non-destructive evaluation in construction, as well as other fields such as robotics, security, and quality control. Millimeter wave imaging uses human-safe, radio frequency signals to make high resolution images of objects that cannot be seen with conventional optical sensors. Because of their long wavelength, millimeter waves pass through many materials that are opaque to visible light, including common construction materials such as drywall, brick, tile, cement, and wood. For example, in the construction market, dramatic cost savings and faster, safer, and more accurate construction work could be achieved using millimeter wave imaging for structural evaluation as well as observing hidden utilities such as wiring and plumbing that should be avoided while drilling, and detecting hazards such as water leaks behind wall surfaces. This project will also provide entrepreneurial opportunity to a new generation of scholars\/innovators as the technology matures toward commercial practice. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to advance the state of the art in millimeter wave imaging and enable low-cost, standalone 3D millimeter wave imagers. Prior work in a laboratory environment has demonstrated the promise of millimeter wave imaging for applications such as structural analysis in construction, however commercialization requires an image sensor that is fast, portable, low power, and low cost. This project will enable low cost hardware\/software platforms for millimeter wave imaging using commercial chipsets with novel general purpose graphics processing unit (GPGPU)-accelerated image reconstruction algorithms."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will be the development of a fermentation-based technology that enables the renewable and sustainable production of medium-chain fatty acids - an important class of widely used industrial chemicals - using glycerol-rich waste streams as feedstocks. These chemical products constitute a growing multi-billion dollar market with applications in the flavoring, fragrances, personal care, plastics, textile, and pharmaceutical industries. This technology also will create new high-value uses for existing glycerol-rich waste streams generated within the bio-diesel industry, which can greatly improve the economic competitiveness of bio-diesel with fossil diesel, especially in an era of low oil prices. Thus, commercialization of this fermentation-based technology will serve as a foundation for developing additional eco-friendly technologies for the production of other industrial chemicals that contribute to the ~$800 billion\/year petrochemical industry, in turn creating new jobs for helping the environment, benefiting society, and building a sustainable future. In addition, this SBIR project will establish a carbon conservation technology as the basis for developing the next-generation of fermentation-based chemical production technologies. This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a unique carbon conserving (C2) platform technology to enable the cost-competitive and sustainable production of a variety of fatty chemicals from renewable feedstocks such as crude glycerol. The C2 platform technology comprises a series of non-natural biosynthetic pathways that minimize\/eliminate carbon loss as CO2 during production, thereby improving theoretical yields over the state of the art by as much as 50%. The improved achievable yields along with the anaerobic production processes enabled by the C2 technology are two crucial features for establishing bioprocesses with cost-competitive economics relative to incumbent technologies, which is critical for commercial success. One goal of this Phase I project will be to demonstrate the production of a high-value fatty acid, hexanoic acid, from crude glycerol and using the C2 technology. For the second goal, enzyme screening, strain development, and metabolic engineering approaches will be implemented for improving hexanoic acid production metrics (i.e., higher titers, rates, and yields) from crude glycerol. Accomplishing these goals will substantially de-risk the C2 technology and establish its commercial potential for the cost-advantaged production of hexanoic acid at the commercial level."

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase I project aims to develop degradable zwitterionic hydrogels (DZH) as injectable soft tissue fillers. Fillers are used to replenish volumes left by surgical procedures, medical disorders, trauma, or aging. There is great need for a filler featuring superior longevity to the market-leading hyaluronic acid (HA) products, while also exhibiting better safety and reversibility than existing synthetic products. Zwitterionic hydrogels are uniquely biocompatible, physiologically stable, and can be processed into tunable injectable formulations. The key milestone targeted in this Phase I project is the achievement of proof-of-concept DZH materials that can be selectively and safely degraded with enzymes while maintaining their differentiating strengths: biocompatibility, longevity, and cost-effective production. Successful commercialization of DZH fillers will provide patients with a safe, long-lasting, cost-effective, and reversible treatment, positioning these fillers as a universal replacement for all currently available product lines. A disruptive product in the multibillion-dollar aesthetic filler market would form a solid basis for a sustainable business and ultimately enable the development and commercialization of many next-generation biomedical products. This project intends to show that DZH formulations based on zwitterionic polymers can meet key requirements of a next-generation injectable tissue filler. If technical targets are met, DZH products will be transformative as the first universal, long-term, and reversible tissue fillers for therapeutic and aesthetic applications. Specifically, their biocompatibility, rheological properties, selective degradability and aesthetic outcomes must meet or exceed the benchmark HA fillers, while their longevity must show key improvement over benchmark products. The main R&amp;D activities are: (I) synthesizing and identifying strong DZH candidates based on particular gel network architectures; (II) demonstrating selective DZH degradability with minimal breakdown by tissue-specific endogenous enzymes; and (III) evaluating proof-of-concept DZH fillers to ensure they meet or exceed the biocompatibility and viscoelasticity benchmarks of HA products. DZH biocompatibility and selective degradation will be studied in vitro to prepare for preclinical in vivo studies in Phase II."

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will automate an experiential simulation learning lab by funding the technical conversion from what is essentially a hardwired product requiring a dedicated lab available to schools within a limited geographic area to a nationally available online product. Additionally, the funding will drive the technological innovation necessary to maintain the immersive, experiential nature of the existing prototype. The project will also allow for research on the underlying assumption of the product: will students be more engaged during content instruction if they are aware that they will be asked to apply their learning in an upcoming simulation? And, if so, will the improved engagement carry over to improved performance on summative assessments? Since the unique nature of the product places it in the middle of the educational technology continuum between digital content and assessment, using current market trends to estimate its sales potential is difficult. However, offering the product online will dramatically decrease its current price point, making the product economically attractive to thousands of teachers and schools across the United States seeking curriculum that engages students who learn best in a team-oriented environment and fosters skill in collaborative, multi-disciplinary problem solving. The intellectual merit of this project lies in the technological innovation that will convert the labor intensive, hardware dependent prototype into an automated online product while maintaining its immersive, engaging qualities. The main objective of the innovation is to create a powerful tool for the classroom teacher that can be implemented in a large lab or on a single computer. A corresponding objective is to determine how effectively the tool engages students in the subject matter and develops real life skills that are in high demand in the 21st century workplace. Teachers will be able to choose from three distinct platforms: Mission Control, a space exploration simulation; Leadership Summit, a global policy making simulation; and Ecosphere, a simulation of areas hidden to the human eye. While being technologically sophisticated, the product also needs to be simple to install and to require minimal training to operate. The product will incorporate multiple controls so that teachers can monitor their students? interactions and manage their progress for optimum effect. Finally, the innovation will also make use of the latest developments in commercially available sound and lighting enhancement products giving teachers control of the timing and level of external sounds and lights."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this project addresses a great demand for in-situ chemical sensor technology with ability to (1) Measure with high resolution the environmental footprint of agricultural and urban development, and (2) Identify potential safety issues related to drinking water quality. High concentrations of nutrients (e.g. nitrate, nitrite, orthophosphate) in surface waters are the source of environmental, public health, and economic issues. Active monitoring of nutrient concentrations in surface waters such as estuaries, lakes and rivers is critical in assessing their health and implementing timely action to minimize ecosystem degradation. This SBIR project aims at developing a disruptive new type of highly miniaturized autonomous water quality chemical sensor, that can be operated remotely and autonomously, has minimal installation and maintenance requirements, is capable of performing thousands of measurements directly in-situ, in both reagent-based and reagent-less configuration, on a single battery charge. Applications that will greatly benefit from such sensors range from scientific research, to estimating nutrient loads, establishing discharge limits, predicting eutrophication conditions and demonstrating compliance with regulatory reporting requirements. Independently, the drinking water industry has its own requirements for autonomous chemical sensors for monitoring reservoirs and distribution networks, optimizing treatment processes and identifying tank nitrification issues early-on. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to achieve the highest level of miniaturization and functionality attempted in a commercial water quality sensor. The core innovation of this proposed e-CHEM system is in the microfluidic chemical analysis module, combining a novel highly-efficient mixing mechanism to homogenize minute volumes of reagent with the fluid sample with a microfluidic implementation of dual reagent-based and reagent-less chemical measurement capability, the possibility of controlling relevant chemical reactions in-situ via precise on-chip temperature management, and finally the potential of overcoming the important hurdle of bio-fouling via novel surface nano-engineering. The parameters measured will include a selection from: ortho-phosphates, nitrites, nitrates, dissolved organic carbon, total and\/or free chlorine, free ammonia, and pH. The system will include bidirectional wireless telemetry to enable automatic alert generation and data transmission to remote servers for visualization, analysis and interpretation. Target accuracy and response times are superior to traditional measurement techniques due to full process automation, elimination of sample degradation and transit times, reduction of human error, and automatic data centralization."

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase I project creates an online integrated training program that combines problem solving and app development. Trainees will be able to create mobile apps to address challenges facing their own communities. Mobile apps have become key to addressing many pain points. Currently, skilled developers work with customers to understand problems and create applications to solve problems. Unfortunately, this restricts app creation to those that have access to development resources and understand problem solving techniques. The platform created in this project will democratize access to app development by giving problem solving and app development skills to high school students. Thus, it presents an opportunity to every citizen to create apps that can address their own or their community&apos;s challenges. This opportunity can have a transformational impact particularly on underprivileged communities where people have very little access to resources. Mobile app development is also a skill that has the potential for significant income generation opportunity. At the end of the training, students will be certified for their problem solving and app generation skill ability. High school students who have certification to prove their problem solving and App Development skills become highly valued employees in the work force of the future. This project creates a drag-and-drop tool that allows anyone to be able to create smartphone applications, as well as an online portal that explains how to use the platform. The app creation tool will allow users to (1) develop a smartphone app for multiple operating systems; (2) live test their apps on their mobile devices; (3) download their completed apps onto their personal devices; and (4) publish their apps to the app store of their choosing. The online learning platform will deliver multimedia content to teach and enable users across the country to be able to build mobile applications on this platform. The world&apos;s mobile population is expected to reach 5.7 billion people by 2020, yet only a very small number of these users are expected to be able program these devices. Thus, this project looks to build a tool that lowers the barrier to building mobile smartphone apps via a drag-and-drop interface, as well as educate users on how to use this tool."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the enabling the expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) through new functions and applications requiring greater wires-free power than available by battery. IoT is an ever-widening array of everyday objects interconnected via the Internet and transforming the way we live and work. &quot;Smart devices&quot; inter-networking in homes, businesses, vehicles, public spaces and elsewhere are an essential driver of the big data revolution, enabling innumerable societal benefits such as improved efficiencies, assure safety, and increase productivity. The growth of IoT devices has been enabled by the miniaturization, modularization, and cost reduction of common chipsets as well as increased intelligence in low-power consumption. IoT products that utilize existing wired power - e.g. smart lights, TVs, speakers, thermostats, security cameras, personal digital assistants, etc. - have dominated the market. Increasingly, however, stand-alone battery-powered IoT devices are gaining traction; but while battery technology is improving, the cost, complexity and downtime of battery replacement and\/or recharging are major constraints. This project aims to develop a new type of indoor light harvesting technology capable of efficiently converting ambient indoor light into the electrical energy needed to power wire-free IoT products.\u00a0 The proposed project aims to demonstrate and develop perovskite PV technology with the efficiency, uniformity, and durability needed for high-impact indoor IoT applications. Visible light is the most ubiquitous ambient power source available in places where humans live, work and gather, but existing light harvesting methods - e.g. crystalline and amorphous silicon PV cells - do not efficiently convert typical indoor light to electricity. For example, state-of-the-art amorphous silicon cells give only 3.6-7% efficiency under typical indoor lighting conditions. In order to enable new IoT products, a photovoltaic material that operates above 30% efficiency under a range of indoor lighting conditions is needed to unlock new levels of power available for sensors and communications that batteries may not easily supply. This project will demonstrate cell designs, film deposition and processing techniques needed to fabricate high-efficiency perovskite PV and to scale perovskite PV from university laboratory sizes to commercial IoT product sizes."

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop new low cost, high performance tooling materials for composite manufacturing. The use of advanced fiber reinforced composites in aircraft has become a necessity to achieve higher performance and greater fuel efficiencies. Boeing?s 787 and Airbus?s A350 are two such aircraft that exemplify the push to increase composite content above 50% by weight. There is a similar push in other transportation vehicles as well. A large opportunity exists for RTM process technology to reduce costs and streamline composite manufacturing operations. Phase I results will have a large impact on the composites industry through cost reduction and manufacturing efficiency gains. It will allow a broader manufacturing base to produce composite parts. Society will see benefits through the broader use of fuel efficient composites in air and land based vehicles. The technology developed can generate $10-$20M in annual revenue within 5 years of the program end. This effort will also foster collaboration between Advanced Ceramics Manufacturing and large aerospace manufacturers. Undergraduates at the University of Arizona and local high school students will have an opportunity to work on the project. Results of this research will be disseminated in multidisciplinary conferences and journals. The intellectual merit of this project is developing low cost materials and manufacturing processes that enable composite materials to be produced in high rate resin transfer molding (RTM). Compared to autoclave based processes, RTM offers several key advantages. This includes: high internal and external geometric complexity, less waste, lower volatile emissions, higher production rates, and excellent surface finish. However, the injection of high pressure ? high temperature resin presents a tooling challenge. Tooling can be a limiting factor for utilizing RTM as the preferred manufacturing route. A large opportunity exists for new tooling technology that can withstand RTM conditions and be easily extracted from the composite after the cure cycle. A soluble RTM capable material will allow RTM applications to grow and reduce the cost of composite manufacturing. The project will develop a new soluble binder-aggregate system that can withstand all RTM process conditions. The results of the Phase I will demonstrate a low cost RTM compatible tooling system that can be formed at high rate and used in high rate composite RTM cycles."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve the care of men with suspected prostate cancer, by providing the benefits of tumor localization within the prostate by state of the art endorectal multiparametric MRI combined with the benefits of precision biopsy using MRI-targeted needle sampling as a single patient-convenient procedure. The current standard approach to prostate cancer, transrectal ultrasound guided systematic biopsy, requires 12 needle samples from standard locations in the prostate with the hope of hitting any cancer that might be present. This option is essentially playing a game of battleships with the prostate, and is, unsurprisingly, inaccurate with high rates of underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis. Many patients require repeated biopsy because of these inaccuracies. By way of contrast, it is inconceivable that breast cancer would be diagnosed by placing twelve needles at standard locations in the breast, yet this has been the longstanding &apos;state-of-the-art&apos; for prostate cancer. With approximately one million prostate biopsies are performed annually in the U.S., the market and clinical need is large and of major socioeconomic importance. The proposed project will preliminarily determine the technical and commercial feasibility of combining an endorectal MRI coil with a transrectal multichannel array of biopsy needle guides into a single device that would provide the ability to perform MRI for diagnosis and targeted needle placement as a single integrated procedure. Such a device could transform the current paradigm for prostate cancer diagnosis, providing greater precision, personalization, and patient convenience. To determine technical feasibility, the project plan is to fabricate and 3D print a proof-of-concept device for initial simulation experiments and selection of the final coil configuration, evaluate imaging performance of the device coil by measuring signal to noise ratio on standard MR images in a human male pelvic phantom and evaluate the fidelity of needle deployment by measurement of linear deviation between actual and intended needle positioning in a phantom in transverse and longitudinal directions. At all stages, continuous design and engineering modifications will be made to ensure satisfactory technical performance."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to use current research in the learning sciences to develop games that make middle school math engaging and relevant. Middle school is a crucial time in a student&apos;s educational journey as it is the period at which their self-concept of ability becomes stable. Studies show that it is also the period at which students start getting disengaged with math and there is a marked increase in negativity towards math from sixth to eighth grade. According to the National Report Card, only about a third of 8th graders in US public schools, of over 3.6 million students, score at the proficient or above level in Math every year. The goal of this proposal is to implement and test the effectiveness of a scaffolded learning and teaching environment, called the &apos;Teachpad&apos;, that helps middle school students learn difficult math concepts. Multiple studies have indicated that students put more effort into learning when they have to teach someone else. This project will extend these studies and evaluate whether the teachpad increases student engagement and improves learning and long term retention of difficult math concepts. The proposed project uses a &quot;teach to learn&quot; framework in which students teach characters in a computer game how to solve specific problems and use the feedback that they receive from the characters to evaluate how well they have understood the concepts themselves. The teachpad uses natural language input, meaning that the students can enter their instruction in plain English and can explain the solution to the problem as they would to a friend or sibling. A semantic parser extracts the useful information from this input and feeds it to a machine learning algorithm to teach a game character how to solve the problem. A model of what the character has learned is also visible to the student who can see how their instruction is working when the character is trying to solve a test problem. This project will implement the teachpad for the order of operations, and will determine how it compares to traditional classroom practices. Data will be collected in authentic educational environments, through observations and interviews to study student engagement and usability, and pretests and posttests (once after the treatment and once when students return from summer break) to evaluate learning outcomes and long term retention."

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase I project will establish the feasibility of a new protein analysis system for rapid and precise quality characterization for biologics - protein-based drugs such as antibodies and recombinant proteins. Biologics have achieved remarkable efficacy for many diseases, e.g. cancer, psoriasis, and are the fastest growing drug development segment. However, biologics are highly complex molecules manufactured in living cells, and as a result, frequent quality testing is required for development, regulatory approval, and commercial manufacturing of biologics. Current testing approaches are cumbersome and too slow to provide the required throughput, taking weeks to complete an analysis. This project will utilize microfluidic technology?s ability to seamlessly integrate multiple analytical functions to complete a protein characterization analysis in only minutes. The innovative approaches and research resulting from this project will advance the fields of protein separation science and expand the microfluidic technology field. This project will also transform biologic drug development and manufacturing by making the critical testing less cumbersome and faster, and will enable more frequent, comprehensive testing. This will result in profound productivity gains that will translate into a greater number of higher quality drugs developed in less time and with less cost. This project will demonstrate proof-of-concept for a novel quantitative protein analysis platform for biologics that combines optically-monitored, capillary isoelectric focusing (cIEF) and mass spectrometry (MS). This project proposes to develop an innovative microfluidic device that incorporates a novel light guide, which is capable of measuring protein levels while simultaneously performing electrophoretic separation and electrospray ionization. Adding this light guide to this device enables a powerful integration of imaged cIEF and MS techniques, enabling simultaneous quantitation and determination of mass and charge heterogeneity profiling of unlabeled protein samples. This microfluidic device will be the first demonstrated integration of these analytical functions in a robust and rapid system suitable for the bioproduction environment. The goals of this project will be to: 1) design and test chips to identify the most optimal design, 2) identify wall coatings required to modify chip surfaces to enable microfluidic electrophoresis, and 3) develop reagents and assay conditions to enable electrophorectic separation by isoelectric focusing that are compatible with ionization for electrospray delivery to mass spec. Success in Phase I will lead to a Phase II program in which we will develop a commercial microfluidic chip and reagent kit, develop the commercial instrument system, and validate the system performance for GMP compliant use."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to drive the next generation of advanced computing power and performance, by manufacturing integrated circuits, the fundamental units of electronic systems, at length scales of 7 nm and smaller. Today?s central processing units (CPUs) each contain 7.2 Bn chips and over 1.2 sextillion chips are manufactured per year to meet computing demands. Next generation technology is expected to enable artificial intelligence and machine learning through both conventional computing and potentially neuromorphic paradigms, bringing to reality transformative applications such as self-driving cars and smart buildings. As Moore?s law continues to set the pace of technological advancement, chipmakers will deploy new EUV (Extreme Ultraviolet) lithography tools, using light of 13.5 nm to pattern integrated circuits or chip architecture into silicon wafers, for the next three generations of technology. Chipmakers strive to bring about the readiness of EUV technology in 2019. The global demand for next generation electronics is forever increasing as the population grows above 7 Bn. However, the global supply of electronics constantly faces challenges to reduce costs and deliver technology beyond Moore?s Law. The proposed project addresses the challenges related to high volume manufacturing at the 7 nm node for lithography tools and its components. For example, an EUV photomask, a high commodity component, patterns and replicates integrated circuit design into silicon wafers. Current EUV photomasks have a sub-optimal manufacturing yield of ~60% and suffer from defectivity which arises during fabrication of its architecture. During operational use the photomask sustains damage from the debris generated by the EUV plasma light source that implants in the mask and inevitably replicates in the wafer, destroying the integrated chip pattern. In high volume manufacturing, these issues manifest in the wafer yield, the reusability of a mask, and drive the need for high cost real-time inspection and metrology. A new EUV photomask which promises greater robustness to defects, a higher manufacturing yield, more reusability of masks in operations and a longer lifetime is presented. The goals of the project are to evaluate new integrated architecture for the EUV mask design, develop a higher yield fabrication process and characterize the EUV performance. More robust photomasks reduce the capital outlay required for in-situ metrology and inspection and ultimately bring down the cost of next generation electronics."

However, many chemical sunscreen ingredients on the market today have been shown to be harmful to the environment and\/or to have adverse health effects. The goal is to produce a previously identified marine sunscreen compound, gadusol, in an economical and sustainable yeast biomanufacturing system, and replace problematic sunscreen ingredients in current use. This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a sustainable means of producing a natural, marine-based sunscreen ingredient for skincare applications. This project focuses on increasing yields and recovery of gadusol, a fish-derived UV-B-absorbing sunscreen, by using the tools of microbial fermentation and synthetic biology. The gadusol biosynthetic pathway was recently introduced into yeast. The key technical objectives of his project are to improve gadusol yields, evaluate yeast-produced gadusol use in skin care products, and develop methods for purification that will be applicable to large-scale production. The anticipated outcome of this project is a new and underutilized sunscreen compound derived from natural sources that has the potential to provide UV protection without the health and environmental risks associated with current commercial ingredients."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve health and save lives while addressing a market opportunity of over a billion dollars per year. Worldwide particulate matter air pollution is responsible for nearly as many deaths as cancer, and more than malaria and AIDS combined. The goal of the project is an inexpensive, consumer market air pollution sensor that offers performance comparable to laboratory instruments that cost hundreds to thousands of dollars. The proposed technology has important societal benefit as it will help mitigate the negative health effects of air pollution in the environment, home, and workplace. The proposed project contributes to scientific knowledge and understanding by investigating novel particulate matter analysis techniques and enabling a highly-sensitive, portable, and low-cost monitor for studies of air pollution. With the form-factor of a AA-battery, it is the only particulate matter air pollution sensor that can fit in devices like the Amazon Echo or Google Nest. Markets for the sensor include smart homes, smart cities, green buildings, automobile cabin monitoring, air purifiers, industrial hygiene, and others.\u00a0 The proposed project will investigate a novel sensor for monitoring particulate matter air pollution. Existing air pollution monitors are expensive, large, and power hungry. The monitors on the consumer market use optical techniques that provide only a proxy estimate of pollution levels and are unable to detect ultrafine particulates which have diameters smaller than 100 nanometers. These ultrafine particulates pose serious health risks. The sensor of this work employs thermophoretic deposition of airborne particulates from a sample stream onto an acoustic wave resonator, and determines the mass deposited by measuring the frequency shift of a sustaining electronic oscillator circuit. The monitor of this work detects particulates from a few microns in diameter to ultrafine, and provides a true mass concentration measurement of the pollution, which is acknowledged as the industry gold-standard. Key activities of the proposal include the development of innovative techniques to collect and analyze particulates and to improve the sensor stability and lifetime. Anticipated technical results include enhanced monitor longevity, improved level of detection, improved manufacturability, and a significant reduction in power consumption. Coupling the sensor to a cell-phone or other wireless device would enable dense temporal and spatial wireless air quality measurements."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will consist in defining the way toward an ultra-fast and energy efficient accelerator for Machine Learning applications deployed on cloud computing. The merging of cloud computing and Machine Learning is shaping our everyday life experience. Examples of applications running on the cloud and exploiting Machine Learning algorithms include data mining, natural language processing and pattern recognition. These three together represent cognitive computing and, due to a vast and growing number of APIs for developers, it is becoming easier to access the computational power of the cloud and develop new applications. This new computation potential is used by businesses to connect data and find patterns valuable for commerce or to improve cybersecurity. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will define a new kind of hardware accelerator, able to speed up cognitive computation by orders of magnitude while reducing energy consumption compared with state-of-the-art processors. The proposed technology is fast and energy efficient, but can be prone to low precision and temperature variation sensitivity. During Phase I, the company will define the hardware accelerator at the system level, optimizing the design for ultra-high speed and sufficient precision to carry out the cognitive computation required. At the same time, the effect of temperature variation and noise will be minimized through improved design. Finally, the energy consumption of the new designs will be estimated and compared with the overall performance of state-of-the-art competitive architectures."

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase I project will show feasibility of a method for instant and accurate grading of student answers to a previously unseen question, after observing an instructor grade no more than 10% of the answers to that question. This project will use instructor-defined grading rubrics, which ensure consistency and provide helpful feedback to the student. Initial work will evaluate the method on multiple choice and fill-in-the-blank questions from a variety of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) subjects. The same method will be general enough to allow extension to short-answer and diagram questions. This work is important because although constructed-response questions are far more effective at assessing student knowledge and guiding student learning, they are significantly more time-consuming and onerous to grade than multiple-choice questions, and are therefore underused in many courses. Giving instructors the ability to grade constructed-response questions 10 times faster will increase the prevalence of this type of assessment and thereby improve STEM education outcomes. It will also increase educator effectiveness, because time that instructors currently spend grading can be better spent in personalized interaction with students. This project will apply and extend recently developed deep neural network methods for few-shot learning to the task of using a small sample of graded student answers to automatically grade the rest. Deep neural networks have recently emerged as the best approach to most machine learning problems. However, unlike humans, who can often learn a new concept after just a few examples, deep neural networks typically need thousands of examples to do the same. Recent developments have enabled deep neural networks to learn new concepts from just a few examples, after seeing millions of examples of other concepts. The first objective of this project is to evaluate these methods using millions of answers to a range of multiple-choice and fill-in-the-blank questions from a diverse set of STEM subjects graded on an existing service. This few-shot learning problem is significantly more complex than problems studied in the research literature. The second objective is to extend these methods, and to develop new methods, in order to reach human-level accuracy after observing the grading of no more than 10% of student answers. The last objective is to ensure that the proposed system is useful to real instructors by implementing a prototype user interface."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to transform the life experiences of youth patients in the Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) community by providing an affordable, comprehensive mobile platform for monitoring health behaviors, tracking biometrics, fostering self-empathy\/empowerment, and developing healthy diabetes self-management practices (DSM) through a gamified app. Adherence to DSM behaviors is an exacting issue with conventional T1D treatment and prevention regimens, though the use of features found in gaming technologies has been shown to be motivating in apps for chronic illnesses. Data-tracking applications meant for public health are believed to yield hidden trends on diet, fitness, mood, and compliance in both individuals and populations, identifying behavioral patterns that may be useful for positive behavior change. With a far-reaching and accessible intervention leveraging the motivational power of games, empathy, and social interaction, health professionals can use this intervention to encourage long-term engagement with data-tracking, which in turn creates rich data sets for tapping into the unseen trends of T1D experiences, contributing to the growing body of T1D knowledge, enriching T1D youth&apos;s quality of life, and streamline patient-provider communications in a cost-effective way that benefits the health care system as a whole. The proposed project aims to provide a better understanding of the affordances of digital technologies in DSM, with emphases on the role of technology as a facilitator of diabetes education, DSM, patient-provider communications, emotional wellness, social and cognitive development, and positive behavior change. T1D diagnoses represent more than 175,000 youth in the United States, and despite significant headway in other areas of mobile health, many families struggle to access T1D tools that dramatically improve the quality of life and health outcomes of their children. To meet this demand, the objectives of this research begin with engineering a full-featured youth-facing prototype\u00afstarring an empathetic virtual pet\u00afcapable of collecting multiple streams of user data and teaching via instructional modules. Data collected during usability studies with stakeholders in the diabetes community will provide insight into effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction of users, while a feasibility study also employing interviews, surveys, and think aloud protocols will offer insight into the practical use of the app in everyday life over a weeklong period. After both of these studies have been conducted, transcripts of recorded sessions and log file data will be analyzed, with the goal of improving the feasibility of extended product usage and success."

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase I project will develop key components of a next-generation lithium metal battery that greatly increases both energy density and safety compared to the best lithium-ion batteries. Such a technology has the potential to deliver significant societal value by improving the state-of-the-art in battery markets such as implantable medical devices, electrified flight, electric vehicles, and many others. In fact, improvements just in medical device batteries may cause a step-change improvement in device design and delivery of healthcare that could save tens of thousands of lives annually. This project will increase opportunities for US-based manufacturing and create jobs by leveraging existing domestic prototyping and manufacturing capabilities around the country. Once material and process costs come down with scale, this technology can also help to expedite mass-market adoption of electric vehicles, consumer electronics, wearables, and other portable devices. The proposed technology may eventually allow for the widespread adoption of sustainable electrified transportation, reduce US dependence on foreign oil, significantly reduce carbon emissions related to transportation, and build an edge for US-based battery R&amp;D and manufacturing. The project addresses the key unmet challenge for next-generation battery chemistries based on lithium metal: highly reversible cycling (&gt; 500 cycles with lithium plating efficiency &gt; 99.7%) with high charging current density (&gt; 1 mA\/cm^2). The objective of the proposed R&amp;D is to prove out a concept around novel metallic anode formulation that can enable unprecedented cycle life, lithium plating efficiency, and charging rate. Existing cell prototypes with pure lithium metal anodes have already demonstrated stable cycling and high specific energy at lower rates. However, inadequate lithium plating efficiency at high charging rates limits the cycle life that can be achieved in a commercial cell. Phase I research efforts will focus on two main objectives: (i) improve reversibility and efficiency of the metallic anode at high charge rates compared to pure lithium metal, and (ii) demonstrate the performance benefits in a coin cell with commercially attractive design parameters that delivers 500 cycles with minimal lithium loss at a high rate. The ultimate goal of the Phase I research is to develop a high-performance lab prototype, based on an optimized electrolyte and commercial cell components, that will provide proof of feasibility for rapid commercialization in the target market."

        "abstract": "The broader social impact and commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project reflects the increasing importance and proliferation of artificial intelligence and algorithmic systems in the educational arena and in other domains of human resources. This places the project strategically at the vanguard of scientific discovery, in building a technology tool that will serve society?s goals. In the post-secondary education and training domains, market inefficiencies require excess spending on both sides of the transaction, adversely affecting both supply and demand. As the nation continues to deliberate the value of higher education in the face of $1.3 billion in student loan debt, streamlining the college application process by matching students and institutions based on an applicant?s career goals can reduce costs for students, their families, and institutions alike. Outside the field of education, this project will impact workplaces where employer-employee matching algorithms will be used in recruiting, hiring, training, and team building, across the domains of health, innovation, national defense, and beyond. Ultimately, people analytics platforms have unlimited potential for national and international commercialization, thus generating tax revenue, creating jobs, and otherwise bolstering the economy. The proposed project focuses on the deployment of people analytics in the domain of college and career readiness and success. While talent evaluation through such innovative software is in its infancy, the small company&apos;s approach to college match will revolutionize how students identify their professional goals and then optimize their college experience for successful life launch. The small company&apos;s team of behavioral and data scientists, game designers, and software engineers, are creating video games that provide insights into a college applicant&apos;s career potential. Their platform captures massive amounts of micro-behavioral data -- how long players hesitate before making a move, persistence in the face of challenge or frustration, ability to parallel process -- to create a psychographic profile of the player&apos;s career-critical characteristics, including traits like competitiveness, extroversion, risk tolerance, and other enduring, personal traits difficult to discern through resumes and traditional, college application materials. Once a student&apos;s career objectives become clear, the company&apos;s proprietary recommendation engine suggests educational institutions and curricula best suited to attain the player?s career goals. In addition to expanding the game platform and collecting player data to develop and fine tune predictive algorithms, this project also will examine factors that influence a player&apos;s response to the insights and recommendations the platform provides. This work will investigate the impact of transparency, or &quot;scrutability&quot;, of game-based assessments and implement visualization tools that promote the player&apos;s understanding of why specific recommendations are made."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to enable the discovery of needed antibody therapeutics in diseases for which there are no available treatments. These therapies act by increasing or decreasing the activity of a type of cell signaling receptor, &quot;G protein-coupled receptors&quot; (GPCRs). Antibodies are highly specific for their targets, an important characteristic for GPCR drugs, as GPCRs comprise a large family of structurally similar proteins. In fact, small molecule drugs for GPCRs often are toxic due to side effects from acting on structurally similar but functionally unrelated GPCRs. This project will develop the first technology that directly identifies antibodies by their ability to modulate GPCR function. These antibodies will impact society&apos;s health by treating currently incurable diseases, and strongly impact scientific understanding by enabling the study of GPCR-related mammalian physiology and disease. The commercial impacts are potentially very large. The global GPCR drug market is over $100B, and over half of marketed antibody therapeutics have annual sales of over $1B. The platform described here has the potential to develop many GPCR antibody therapeutics, and thereby generate an enormous amount of value for patients, society at large, and co-development partners. This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a platform for discovering GPCR-modulating antibodies. This platform could be critical for generating tools for studying GPCR-related biology and disease, and for developing therapeutics with fewer side effects than small molecule drugs to treat GPCR-related diseases. Developing functional GPCR antibodies using traditional methods is encumbered by the difficulty in producing antigens that represent the GPCR in a functional state, and a lack of high-throughput assays of GPCR function. The proposed platform and method expresses human GPCRs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast, couples activity to selectable phenotypes, and directly selects antibodies that modulate GPCR function in the same cells. The first objective aims to further characterize the activity and specificity of camelid antibodies (&quot;nanobodies&quot;) antagonists that inhibit the endogenous yeast GPCR, Ste2, and then perform agonist selections to identify at least one Ste2 agonist. The second objective aims to further develop the platform to enable interrogating a broader array of human GPCR targets using ScFv antibody libraries, and to identify at least one agonist or antagonist of a therapeutically relevant human GPCR. Positive results will demonstrate the feasibility of the platform."

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will demonstrate the ability to create a new family of biobased and biodegradable polymers produced from agricultural and forestry waste streams that have the potential to mitigate landfill-bound, single-use plastics prevalent in agricultural operations. In conventional agricultural operations, farmers use plastic mulch films to block weeds and retain moisture in the soil, ultimately increasing crop yields. Unfortunately, the non-degradable plastics that are used must be removed after harvest and sent to a landfill as they are not recyclable due to contamination by soil and pesticides, leading to significant labor and disposal costs and increasing environmental burden. In this project, lignin polymer alloys are investigated as an innovative biodegradable plastic platform which can be used as an alternative to conventional materials that are not recyclable. Agriculture films represent a global market of $2.5 billion. Other attractive market opportunities include agricultural containers ($5 billion), garbage bags ($10 billion), and packaging ($115 billion). Lignin as a renewable feedstock is an excellent candidate for low cost, biodegradable plastics. Successful demonstration of commercial-scale uses for lignin is vital for the emerging biorefinery industry, and a primary task to secure the energy and materials future for the US. The intellectual merit of this project addresses the need for low-cost, biobased plastics to replace petroleum derived materials, while ensuring a closed-loop lifecycle that does not generate financial and environmental burden due to waste accumulation. To date, lignin-based polymers have been prohibitively expensive due to the need for extensive solvent-based modification and separations processes. The objective of this research project is to demonstrate the production of lignin-polymer alloys with: 1) unmodified lignin contents of 50% or higher through solvent-free, high shear melt processing; 2) enhanced interfacial surface area for material durability; 3) mechanical properties near or exceeding that of low-density polyethylene; and 4) biodegradability under both ambient soil and thermophilic composting conditions. The expected technical results will be production of at least 1 optimal formulation meeting the above conditions identified as suitable for use in agricultural mulch film applications. If all 4 of these are achieved, further research in a subsequent Phase II award will allow for demonstration of scaled manufacturing of this new family of sustainable biomaterials and has the potential to lead to some of the first commercially viable lignin-based plastics in the US for use in agricultural plastic applications and beyond."

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase II project addresses low student engagement through a dynamic video delivery environment with a novel, real-time algorithm that adjusts the instructional pathway to each student&apos;s readiness level. According to research, the greatest challenge facing teachers is overcoming the fact that between 25-66% of students are disengaged. Adapting instruction to each student&apos;s learning background has long been touted as the most effective method to drive student engagement; when instruction is individualized, engagement and outcomes increase dramatically. By calibrating video segments to student readiness, this project delivers appropriately challenging instruction to most effectively sustain engagement. Building on promising results in Phase I, the project aims to improve engagement and outcomes for all Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) students and, most pointedly, impacts English Language Learners (ELL) who often fall behind in STEM classes because instruction is beyond their readiness and in-class support is insufficient. Considering that ELL population is the fastest-growing population of public school students in the United States, this project has a significant potential to drive a STEM proficient workforce. Furthermore, given a strong, pre-existing client base, the project team is well positioned to penetrate the $110 million immediately addressable market. By 2020, the project team expects to be changing how 10% of U.S. middle schoolers absorb STEM instruction, opening a pathway to the adoption of powerful blended classroom techniques that enhance engagement, improve learning, and promote STEM careers. The core innovation is a research-founded algorithm to deliver appropriately complex instruction through all video segments. For successful delivery of appropriately complex instructional video segments, the project (1) measures student complexity readiness, (2) maintains a database of video segments categorized by complexity (using factors such as syntactic and lexical complexity), and (3) uniquely unifies that information to identify a real-time next step for that student (which video segment should be shown). The aim is to enhance outcomes by providing each student an appropriately complex instructional pathway forward. With roots in the leading interactive video solution, this project is made possible through access to a large database of tagged and curated videos (hundreds of thousands) and questions (millions) and provides an unprecedented opportunity to develop adaptive instructional pathways for a diverse learning spectrum. For Phase II, the project team&apos;s goal is to deploy a fully functioning classroom prototype of a product built around a middle school Physical Science unit and measure impact on engagement and learning. The team will employ stimulated recall interviewing techniques, speak aloud interview protocols, and quantitative usage logs to assess the feasibility of highly-adaptive video instruction to increase student engagement. Evaluation will include both formative components (to gauge implementation and iterative improvement) as well as summative components to assess impact on engagement and learning outcomes in a mixed-methods design including multiple pilot studies with control and experiment groups. This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project are numerous and include commercial, societal, environmental, and educational impacts. Commercially, an innovation of this magnitude would enable flexible design illumination, with great control over light placement, beam shape, stray light, and light pollution, all while decreasing the size and complexity of the optics and fixtures required. This will impact the amount of electricity used for lighting, helping to reduce global energy consumption, preserve our environment, and create economic and societal benefits. This project will also result in the employment several technical personnel to carry out the project&apos;s technical goals. Educational outreach will continue to impact the local community, students and researchers at nearby institutions, as well as visitors through seminars and workshops on solid-state lighting, materials research, and entrepreneurship. Furthermore, the technical results may also inform future materials research in the development of robust materials, components, and device architectures with optimal properties to advance other areas of solid-state lighting research. The proposed project is aimed at achieving deployment of laser-stimulated phosphor technology for illumination in the commercial marketplace. Research in the field of solid-state lighting is advancing towards the goal of ultra-efficient and smart lighting. Exploring laser-stimulated phosphor emission could lead to next generation, energy-efficient light sources, surpassing the limitations of current lighting technologies. Optical modeling and thermal simulations will be used to optimize the optics, phosphor materials, and device architectures to achieve narrow-beam angle, low-etendue, and high color-quality white light sources, while maintaining efficient operating temperature. Secondary components will be designed, including the electronics, packaging, heat sinks; compatibility tested with fixtures and manufacturing processes; and implementation into a light engine compatible in design and functionality with customer-specific applications. Regulatory, safety, and performance testing will be completed to achieve industry-specific standards, by working with regulatory bodies to test lifetime and durability in operating conditions, implementation of safety mechanisms, and photometric testing to ensure performance metrics. Lastly, planning, partnerships, execution, data collection, and reporting of field trail testing of products in real life conditions will result in a fully deployed and tested product, ready for implementation.

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project extends to industry stakeholders holding financial interests that are impacted by climate change. Climate change has a scientifically evident impact on the intensity, duration, and frequency of extreme weather events. It has become imperative for organizations in all sectors to gain a clear understanding of the impacts of climate change on their business so as to inform strategic planning and risk management strategies. Those in the risk transfer industry, in particular reinsurance companies, are the most likely early adopters given their technical sophistication and their increasing and acute awareness of the financial impacts climate change now has on their bottom line. Thus, the company&apos;s goal is to penetrate the reinsurance industry as an entry point to the more broadly defined risk transfer industry. Subsequently, the company will utilize the platform to address problems in agricultural investment, real estate investment, and energy planning - all sectors that will be adversely impacted by climate change in specific, well-defined ways. The adaptation in each of these sectors is vital to the well-being and prosperity of the ultimate stakeholder: the American taxpayer. This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project aims to harness industry knowledge and expand on the technical work conducted during the company&apos;s Phase I project, with the objective of building a modular software platform generalizable to multiple key climate change hazards and extensible to other strategically identified sectors. The knowledge gathered via customer discovery interviews in Phase I will serve as a guide for product development. The technical work completed in Phase I, in particular extreme precipitation modeling under climate change and its application to the risk transfer sector, will serve as a foundation for expansion into the modeling of additional hazards. There are currently no tools available that integrate climate change informatics into risk management at scale. The company aims to address this problem through the translation of physics-guided statistical modeling to a commercial software platform. Upon conclusion of the Phase II project, the company expects to have a completed product that will house data on additional hazards exacerbated by climate change, with applications in the agriculture, commercial real estate, and the energy sectors. The company will show product value through sector-tailored software demonstrations and case studies that demonstrate return on investment to be realized by using this platform.

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to extend the function of windows by turning them into daytime sources of electricity. The target market for this technology is tall buildings in urban areas, where electricity demand is the highest and the available space for installing solar cells is smallest. This technology utilizes a window tint that can absorb sunlight and remit light of a certain color through the window&apos;s glass to small solar cells located at the edges. This technology hasn&apos;t been commercialized previously because most tint materials typically absorb their own emitted light, limiting efficiency. This project will provide a novel solution to these problems with a low-cost window tint material made from quantum dots. The work conducted in this project focuses on scaling up prototypes and optimization for cost and reliability. With this technology, tall buildings will approach net-zero energy consumption or even supply electricity to the grid. This would reduce the city&apos;s carbon footprint as well as save money for the companies\/individuals occupying these buildings, which would increase their prosperity and welfare. This technology would also reduce pollution by limiting the amount of burned fossil fuels needed to generate electricity.\u00a0 The proposed project develops and scales up the electricity-generating window prototypes to the square meter size, validates long-term reliability, optimizes for manufacturing, and launches pilot projects. The technology is based on luminescent solar concentrators, which are made by tinting a window with a fluorophore material that partially absorbs sunlight and then converts it to fluorescence, preferably in the near-infrared. The fluorescence is trapped inside the window by total internal reflection and is concentrated to the edges where small solar cells efficiently convert that light into electricity. Utilizing this technology in windows to generate electricity has not been commercialized due to unsuitable fluorophores. The fluorophore used in this project are quantum dots composed of CuInSeS\/ZnS, which solves the problems of previous materials. Traditional fluorophores like dyes typically have strong self-absorption, narrow spectral absorption, and poor stability. Quantum dots are more stable, but are expensive, sometimes toxic (due to heavy metals), and also suffer from self-absorption. The breakthrough in CuInSeS\/ZnS quantum dots is that they are significantly cheaper, avoid toxic elements, have near-infrared fluorescence optimal for low-cost commercial solar cells, and do not self-absorb. At the conclusion of the phase II project, prototype products will be installed in at least one building.\u00a0 This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will be to develop a platform technology for detecting autoantibody markers for research and clinical diagnostics. Precision medicine requires the development of more powerful bioanalytic technologies to diagnose disease and direct targeted therapies. This platform uses a ligation-based DNA barcoding technology for improved antibody detection with increased analytical sensitivity and multiplex power to detect more at the most clinically useful time. Additionally, as a solution-phase assay, it is able to detect numerous clinically-relevant autoantibodies that are refractory to common techniques like ELISA. This platform has the potential to accelerate the development of lifesaving diagnostics across a broad spectrum of human diseases. This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project aims to develop the first solution-phase, ultrasensitive and multiplex antibody assay platform for the early detection, monitoring and treatment of human diseases. The Antibody Detection by Agglutination-PCR (ADAP) platform represents a major advancement in multiplex immunoassay testing. Many current multiplex technologies, such as microarrays and bead-based arrays, scale poorly due to cross-analyte interference, and lack the analytical sensitivity to detect crippling diseases at the most favorable time. The Phase I results showed the expanded and validated ADAP technology for the ultrasensitive and multiplex detection of antibody biomarkers. The Phase II objectives are: 1) Validation of the multiplex ADAP assay for clinical diagnostics serving autoimmune connective tissue diseases, thyroid disorders and celiac diseases; 2) High-throughput automation of multiplex ADAP assay technology for clinical diagnostics; 3) Manufacturing of assay reagents and establishment of quality control standards; and 4) Demonstration of the applicability of multiplex ADAP for a broader set of antibodies. The intellectual merit of this project resides in the achievement of 10,000x increased sensitivity, and 20-30% increased specificity at multiplex while having the option to use existing PCR reader platforms to help keep lab capital costs low. This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this project is to develop low-power, low-cost and small form factor wireless connectivity solutions, facilitating the deployment of inexpensive and long-lived wireless sensors and devices for a diverse set of applications. For instance, it is infeasible to place conventional sensors or wireless connectivity on low-cost or disposable items due to the high cost and short battery life of wireless communication devices. With the successful completion of this project, items ranging from consumer packaged goods to medical consumables and pill bottles could be connected to the Internet. Brands and manufacturers could gain previously inaccessible market and product insights based on the way products are used, while consumers could enjoy benefits ranging from new services and features (such as automated product reordering) to better-designed products which more closely fit their needs. By enabling new use cases for wireless connectivity, this technology can prompt innovation across many industries. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project introduces a new long-range backscatter-based communication technology based on Chirp Spread Spectrum, a wireless protocol which can be detected at extremely low signal levels. The low-power wireless system prior to this project is comprised of three elements: A passive backscatter-based radio, a first gateway device which provides an illumination signal, and a second gateway device which receives the resulting backscattered data and forwards data to the Internet. In this project, the passive backscatter-based radio will be implemented in an integrated circuit form, realizing the low power and low cost possible with this technology. The two gateway devices will be combined into one full-duplex radio device, to address the needs of the majority of deployment scenarios. Techniques to localize the backscatter radios within the field of the gateway device will be explored. Finally, security challenges will be addressed and the system will undergo extensive evaluation and testing."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the enablement of advanced integration of thinner, more flexible and heterogeneous semiconductor devices. It will accelerate the adoption of next generation integrated circuit chips and bring significant benefit to society through the development of high performance electronics. Driven by portable devices in the mobile internet industry and the cost reduction requirements in Internet of Things (IOT), integrated circuit chips are becoming thinner and more flexible, whereas the working environments expose them to more extreme conditions. This trend creates increasing challenges and reducing reliability due to their higher inclination to failure. This proposed novel opto-mechanical system is able to identify early indications of potential problems. It can accelerate the recent industrial trends moving toward IOT and autonomous vehicle by significantly reducing development cycle time and engineering labor. These emerging industrial trends have induced many mechanical reliability issues, and are making it difficult to meet required quality and reliability of semiconductor devices. Many of these issues could be anticipated in integrated circuit design and on production lines with an instrument capable of measuring the sensitivity at the micron level. The objective of this proposed project is to develop a system for noncontact detection of premature failure. An imaging approach and stereo cameras are used to measure and track the sample. The anticipated result is to develop an instrument with ten-fold performance improvement over instruments currently available. This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase II project aims to facilitate understanding of cellular diversity in tumors, a phenomenon that contributes to acquired drug resistance. Quantifying and understanding this diversity may help predict a patient?s response to certain drugs which would allow the selection of ideal drug combinations for an individual patient?s tumor, thus enabling personalized medicine. This Phase II project will provide drug developers and researchers with a tool that can quantify diversity by correlating genetic and spatial information from tumors, providing crucial information about tumor composition that is currently missing today. This project will translate the technology into an efficient, high-throughput workflow that will enable commercialization with drug developers, researchers, and reference laboratories, generating both income and multiple job opportunities. The commercialization of this innovation will significantly impact scientific, corporate, and patient communities. Researchers will have a new tool improving drug development for cancer and other diseases, including Alzheimer?s and diabetes. Payers, such as insurance companies and the government, will save costs by eliminating unnecessary spending on treatments for patients who will not respond. Most importantly, patients will have broader access to personalized medicine through new treatments and screening methods that can help determine the optimum drug combinations for them. A single tumor contains multiple populations of cells that each have unique mutations, and it is necessary to understand the location and genetic differences of these cells in order to provide effective combination therapies that will not result in overall treatment failure or relapse. This Phase II project aims to provide drug developers, researchers, and physicians with a tool to correlate genetic and spatial information about individual tumors. Using a proprietary microfluidic device adhered to a standard microscope slide and tissue biopsy, incorporated with a laser-coupled microscope, this tool is capable of providing information that it is not possible to obtain from any other method today. Building upon the feasibility established during the Phase I project, Phase II will involve performing NGS to demonstrate the instrument?s usefulness in providing data for clinical research and biomarker discovery. It will also involve building a fully integrated prototype instrument with features that increase automation and throughput to make the technology economically feasible for commercialization. These developments will showcase the instrument?s value to customers as well as enable the commercial launch of a service."

The system uses modern technology to avoid digital screens. Throughout this experience, learners tap into their natural proclivities to make and shape ideas in the non-digital world, and develop the ability to fluently construct new ideas in a technical medium. The commercialization of this project will address two, nationally important issues. First, by scaffolding young learners through progressively bringing their ideas into reality, this project will foster creative confidence: the natural ability to come up with ideas and the courage to act on them. Next, there is a gender gap in innovation and entrepreneurship in the United States. Women patent at 40% the rate of men, only 9% of information technology related patents have one or more female inventors, and only 8% of the beneficiaries of incubators meant to commercialize innovations were women. This project will address gender equity issues in the maker community (currently 80% male) and by widening pathways to engage in making. The system is composed of a projection system that allows real-time programmable interactions between everyday and virtual objects without a computer screen. Throughout this research, we will create and refine STEM (Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics) Apps, which are built-in augmented activities where users create small inventions with everyday objects to code interactions and affect program flow or gameplay, develop Augmented Tutorials, bridge seamlessly to existing STEM tools through real-time interfacing, as well as manufacture and prepare the system.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will address the design, prototype and testing of a modular tension control device for individual tension regulation in the composite manufacturing sector. Composites are increasingly used in mission critical applications where the material and the product must perform reliably, while at the same time improving productivity, increasing product quality and lowering cost. By precisely and consistently controlling tension, there are fewer voids, skips or uneven tows, resulting in a higher quality product. This is particularly important when safety is dependent on the structural integrity of the materials. Overall, composite applications are greener and have a positive environmental impact. Comparably priced but safer automobiles from composites will be lighter and consume less fuel. Composites further reduce reliance on fossil fuels, as they are the building blocks to harness renewable energy. Wind blades, solar panels and underwater turbines are all made from composites. This is a rapidly growing multi-billion-dollar market, and the projected share of the targeted tension control market is in the range of $200 million, growing equally fast, if not faster. This project will solve a problem that has plagued the composites industry since its inception. Tension control is especially difficult (and yet very important in the composites industry), as multiple materials with different tear strengths and varying elasticity are combined to make stronger products. Lack of cost effective tension control has, up to this point, limited the speed and quality of finished products. Phase II objectives are to prototype and develop the manufacturing process for the Modular Tensioning Cartridge. The Phase II Objectives are: 1) Control package design - the goal is to create a central base station to provide power, communications and a central interface for the use of multiple Modular Tensioning Cartridge units; 2) Finalization - all successfully tested components must be assembled into a singular industrial grade prototype unit and then tested; 3) Product release - upon final prototype testing, field trials will be conducted to validate and finalize technology leading to full production. In phase I, feasibility of the individual components to meet performance requirements was successfully demonstrated. In Phase II, prototype units will be developed and tested refining the design to meet the performance expectations of the customers. This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project aims to provide an affordable sealant for sealing joints and cracks in cement concrete pavement, asphalt concrete pavement, bridge deck, etc. In transportation infrastructure, joints are intentionally constructed in order to allow movement of the structural elements due to linear thermal expansion\/contraction when temperature rises\/drops. Cracks are a common failure mode in pavement, and if not properly sealed, can cause water damage and rupture of the concrete. Sealing cracks and joints is a common practice to maintain or extend the service life of structural elements. Various types of sealants are currently used with an annual market value of about $6.1 billion. Unfortunately, many of these sealants fail to work properly and are ineffective in extending service life. In this project, a smart sealant will be developed that expands upon cooling and contracts upon heating, a thermal characteristic opposite to that of concrete. The product will address a significant problem in the industry arising from thermal movement of joined\/cracked structural elements. It is expected that the product will have about 0.8% market share in 5 years helping with the need for longer lasting and more reliable infrastructure. The intellectual merit of this project lies in the development and validation of a smart sealant technology. The root cause for joint failure is that the thermal expansion characteristics of most sealants is similar to that of concrete, i.e., contraction upon cooling and expansion upon heating. This behavior is contrary to what is required of sealants in order to avoid thermally induced separation between the sealant and the concrete. Unfortunately, few materials can fulfill this requirement in a cost effective way while maintaining other desired physical properties (such as, deformability). This Phase II project will solve the century-long problem through the use of a two-way shape memory polymer (2W-SMP) based sealant that addresses the root cause. Building upon the feasibility study of the Phase I project, the Phase II project will focus on further improving the 2W-SMP based sealant for sealing joints or cracks in pavement, and validate the product through third-party lab-scale testing, and full-scale field-level verification in both hot and humid environment and extremely cold regions. Technical outcome will include lab-scale validation, field level performance and verification, and construction protocols for this new smart material, laying a solid foundation for adoption by home owners and transportation agencies."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will usher new Artificial Intelligence\/Machine Learning (AI\/ML) products delivering high accuracy with explainability. Without rationale behind predictions, decision makers can&apos;t trust and effectively use AI\/ML solutions. Outcome of R&amp;D through this project would lead to more accurate and faster detection with appropriate explanation of anomalous interactions and recommend effective controls to 1) eliminate billions of dollars of fraud, waste and abuse (FWA) in Health Insurance markets; 2) lower costs, improve quality and speed of Health Care delivery to consumers; and 3) promote new markets in Personalized Health and Smart Health sector for emerging Medical Internet-of-Things (IOT) devices and systems, enabling economic growth. The results of this research are expected to enable the discovery of medical anomaly together with advancing the detection of new types of FWA. The boost in detection accuracy with explanation will save hundreds of millions of dollars. Societal impact includes reduced costs to consumers and taxpayers through better FWA control and advance health outcome through early medical IOT anomaly detection. More broadly, the system is expected to detect possible opioid or substance abuse epidemic cohorts, under\/over-medication, advanced alerts for community health anomalies. The proposed project will extend and generalize a novel machine learning method to solve the Fraud, Waste, and Abuse (FWA) problem in health insurance, coupled with explanatory capability providing rational behind predictions and operationalized in a distributed parallel computing framework for scaling. The technical problem is how to combine relations between entities (e.g., doctors) with their attribute (e.g., a doctor&apos;s prescription history). This project advances the state of the art by combining relations between rows in the training data (e.g. doctors) with standard machine learning to improve prediction accuracy while facilitating local explanation. The result is vastly improved prediction accuracy with explainability. Thus, the method uses network information to fill in the gaps of entity information alone and vice versa while facilitating explanation for a test case. This method is expected to significantly improve the ability to detect FWA and pave ways for multi Billion dollars savings, call out IOT-based medical anomaly in advance to improve health outcome and build trust in the predictions for the decision makers through the explanations provided. The team intends to deliver not only the accuracy boost with explainability, but a fully operational system with automated data pipeline, parallel and distributed algorithmic processing framework which can be deployed on a SaaS basis or an enterprise solution. This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "abstract": "The JLab Electron-Ion Collider (JLEIC) is proposed to collider spin-polarized beams of electrons and ions at high energy and high luminosity- Sustaining high luminosity requires the use of bunched-beam electron cooling to control emittance growth in the circulating ion beam- The electron cooling requires that a bunched electron beam be coalesced with the ion bunches so that they travel with the same vector velocity through a long straight section in the collider ring- The electron beam must be confined by a ~1 T solenoidal magnetic field, so that each is confined to a tiny-radius spiral around a field line and cannot recoil transversely when it scatters from an ion- The cooling process requires extremely tight alignment of the magnetic field lines with the beam axis, with a tolerance that is less than the angle spread in the ion beam- For the desired ion beam emittance inn JLEIC, that alignment must be better than 10 \uf06drad over a cooling length of ~60 m- Such alignment has never been achieved experimentally in a solenoid- Misalignments can arise from irregularities in the solenoid windings, material variations in the flux return steel, and misalignments of winding modules- ATC has developed a design for a flux-washer method to suppress transverse components of magnetic field in the aperture of a solenoid- A stack of interleaved thin annular steel washers and ceramic spacers is assembled with micro-alignment and bonded to form long cylindrical columns- The columns are supported within the solenoid- When the solenoid is operated at ~1T field, each steel washer is unsaturated, and its flat face presents a strong boundary condition to shunt field components parallel to the face- Any transverse magnetic field that is generated by imperfections in the solenoid is thereby shunted through the washers so that it is shielded from affecting the beams traversing the cooling channel- Simulations indicate that this method should yield a factor ~10 suppression of transverse fields, so the alignmetn for cooling at JLEIC can be met"

        "abstract": "Understanding the role that aerosols play in atmospheric radiative forcing is currently the major focus of the Department of Energy (DOE) Atmospheric Sciences Program- Aerosol particles affect the radiative balance of the earth directly, by scattering and absorbing solar and terrestrial radiation, and indirectly, by acting as cloud condensation nuclei- It is now recognized that the atmospheric loading of aerosols generated through human activities, especially combustion, can exert an influence on the earth\u2019s radiation budget comparable in magnitude with greenhouse gases- This proposal addresses the specific issue of accurate measurement of aerosol absorption- We propose to design, build and test an optical absorption monitor based on the use of photothermal interferometry monitor- In this technique, absorbing particles are heated by a modulated excitation laser producing a small temperature change in the surrounding air- This temporary change in temperature is recorded as a change in the refractive index as measured by an interferometer- A major advantage of this technique is that the modulation frequency of the excitation laser can be varied so as to avoid acoustic noise, an issue for instruments deployed on aircraft and ground-based vehicles-"

        "abstract": "Mass spectrometric measurement of elemental isotopic ratios from solids has been mostly obtained by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) which has a sensitivity for almost all elements superior to Xray fluorescence and laser desorption ICPMS- In SIMS elemental and molecular ions are liberated from the near surface of a solid by energetic micron or submicron focused ion beams and extracted with an electric field into a mass spectrometer (often a time of flight mass spectrometer)- Two problems prevent SIMS from competing successfully with XRF and ICP MS for elemental identification in plant and animal tissues: 1) Quantitative SIMS elemental analysis is almost impossible in complicated biological systems 2) Molecular ions almost always overwhelm the desired elemental ions thus requiring large high resolution imaging Mass Spectrometers for separation- In contrast, Ionwerks has invented and marketed an instrument and method for measuring forward recoiled surface elemental ions which are also created during but excluded from the SIMS analysis process- These elemental ions are created during forward keV energies in a billiard ball type collision from a glancing angle, energetic primary ion which gives the recoiled ion keV energies into the forward direction exiting the surface- Molecular information is destroyed during this violent collision leaving only the ionized elements in the spectrum which can be easily analyzed with less complex time of flight spectrometers than SIMS- Under the correct geometries these recoil intensities are a significant minority portion of all the sputtered elements and molecules created during the primary ion collision- We call this alternative technique Mass Spectrometry of Recoiled Ions (MSRI)- In Figure 1A a direct comparison of SIMS and MSRI data acquired sequentially with the same beam dose from the same surface shows similar intensities of the doped Be signal from the two techniques- The presence of complicating SIMS molecular ion signals which prohibit Cr and Fe analysis is eliminated in MSRI- In Phase I we will explore the possibility that these simple isotopically resolved elemental spectra can be acquired from a specially designed miniature time of flight detector which will simultaneously detect both positive and negative ions originating from the same surface volume (something SIMS cannot do)- In a phase II effort, this miniature bipolar MSRI spectrometer would be located within the Zeiss Orion Helium\/Neon Ion microscope at Rutgers University in which the Ionwerks NanoRBS is now operational- At present the sensitivity of NanoRBS is 280,000 atoms of Pt within a 2500 nm3 volume (equivalent of one 15 nm diameter Pt nanoparticle)- Quantitation of the MSRI signals will arise by the correlative combination of NanoMSRI and NanoRBS, which can be made quantitative by standards- Thus each pixel in an elemental image map within intercellular organelles might be made quantitative by comparison the Neon backscatter signal acquired simultaneously with the MSRI ion intensities- This instrumental combination will be useful in locating either dispersed endogenous elements or toxicants as well as intact elemental Nanoparticulates which are intentionally or accidentally introduced into the organism- Moreover, if the high pressure freezers and sample preparation techniques developed for cryoTEM are ultimately implemented within the Zeiss Orion, then depth profiling of complicated fragile structures may be attempted -"

        "abstract": "Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) require robust, hermetic seals that can prevent both fuel leakage and direct mixing of fuel and air- The seal materials should be electrical insulators and should be chemically and mechanically stable in high temperature reactive environments (e-g-, moist reducing and\/or oxidizing conditions)- The seals should exhibit no deleterious interfacial reactions with other cell components, should be created at a low enough temperature to avoid damaging cell components (not higher than 900\u00baC for some materials), and should not migrate or flow from the designated sealing region because of any applied load during cell operation- In addition, the seals should be able to withstand numerous thermal cycles between the operational temperature (e-g-, 700-900\u00baC) and room temperature- Recent research has focused on \u201ccompliant (or viscous)\u201d glasses that remain stable over time in the SOFC stack operating environment- These materials are able to accommodate relative motion between the surfaces being sealed without the development of permanent leaks, and to \u201creseal\u201d cracks created from thermal stresses through viscous flow- The compliant glasses (including MO-SCI G73, G102, etc-) considered for the viscous sealing application have broadly desirable thermo-mechanical properties and thermo-chemical characteristics, but their relatively low CTE (coefficient of thermal expansion) values below the glass transition temperature are still a concern- We propose to develop composite materials combining the compliant, crystallization- resistant glasses developed by MO-SCI with higher expansion, chemically-compatible filler materials to create a \u2018compliant composite sealant\u2019 with greater CTE-"

        "abstract": "Molten salts are a crucial component in the proposed advanced nuclear reactors called \u201cmolten salt reactors\u201d (MSRs)- The appealing aspect of an MSR is that a meltdown is virtually impossible, since the fuel is dissolved into the salt- One of the key challenges hindering MSRs is corrosion of structural materials that hold the molten salt due to the interactions between material and molten salt at high temperature, especially within a radioactive environment that accelerates materials degradation- Currently, materials analysis must be performed after the corrosion has occurred when the molten salt has cooled, which means that the process cannot be studied as it occurs- Here, we propose to develop an innovative characterization technique to study the processes while the molten salt is hot, potentially even, while it is in operation- This would enable fundamental understanding of phenomena governing interfacial behavior at the interface between a molten salt, and a material- This project explicitly addresses the central challenge of identifying new materials for MSRs- By observing corrosion as it happens at the material-molten salt interface, we can identify how to prevent and reduce it- This work will enable a fundamental understanding of materials corrosion in high-temperature molten salts- To address this task, we specifically propose to develop a setup to characterize the interface between the molten salt and materials using X-rays- The setup will consist of a small furnace enclosing a container of molten salt and a material of interest- This furnace will be outfitted with holes that allow X-ray beams to pass through the sample to the detector-"

        "abstract": "For the foreseeable future, the Nation\u2019s energy demand will continue to come largely from indigenous fossil energy resources and hydrocarbon fuels- Specifically waste coal plus other opportunity fuels need to be utilized as a feedstock to eliminate a waste stream and optimized to maximize energy yield and cleanly minimize pollutant emissions- Modular equipment is needed for installation in coal preparation locations, military installations, and research park facilities- Thermal decomposition of coal, biomass, and mixed solid waste (MSW) have been shown to reduce a waste stream while providing liquid and gaseous fuel products with low pollutant emissions- However, thermal decomposition processes have several challenges associated with preprocessing biomass and MSW, feeding and conveying material into the reactor, and post processing of syngas to remove undesirable products while upgrading to increase yield of high value products- Entrained flow gasifiers produce very little methane and a wide range of H2\/CO ratios (0-5\u20132-0) but are limited in their ability to effectively feed large biomass particles into the reactor- A solution to the feeding problems associated with entrained flow gasifiers is to use a low-temperature pyrolysis reactor for torrefaction of the biomass mixture, creating a feedstock similar to coal and capable of grinding down, mixing with the coal feed, and feeding into the entrained flow gasifier- In the Phase I, we will analyze the thermochemical conversion kinetics of several coal-MSW blends by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)- These feedstock blends will be preprocessed and torrefied using the integrated DCIMS (drying, conveyance, inerting, milling-sharpening) preprocessing equipment and pilot scale pyrolysis unit developed by Mainstream- Following the gasification demonstration, a process model will be developed for the proposed reaction pathway with additional upgrading equipment used to maximize H2 yields and minimize CH4 and other pollutants in the gas stream- A technoeconomic analysis will be conducted quantifying the benefits the process and determine the capital and operating expenses- In Phase II, Mainstream would partner with EERC for further process optimization and develop the process and equipment for constructing a modular, demonstrable unit- The pilot-scale demonstration system will undergo performance testing for validation of cost and operational models-"

        "abstract": "Polymer-electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel-cells are one of the most promising energy conversion technologies for renewable clean energy applications- A major challenge preventing the widespread use and commercialization of PEM fuel cells is achieving high performance with low-loadings of platinum group metal (PGM) catalysts- One of the factors driving performance limitations in the cell is the mass transport losses within the cathode catalyst layers (CCL) due to sluggish oxygen-reduction reactions occurring at the platinum-ionomer interface- The role of the ionomer in CCL is to provide transport pathways for protons and molecular oxygen so they could meet the electrons and react at the platinum interface- Any resistance to transport of these ionic and gaseous species within the CCL results in mass-transport limitations and performance losses, especially at high current densities- It is known that mass-transport losses increase with reduced platinum loading, thereby creating a performance-cost tradeoff for fuel cells- It is of great interest to understand these transport losses for low-loaded catalyst layers and mitigate them using engineering ionomer materials in order to achieve sustainable cell performance without sacrificing the cost targets- A viable solution to reduce the transport resistances in the catalyst layers is to create new ionomers that can provide good ion and oxygen transport needed to accomplish high- performing fuel cell catalysts- Characterization of transport properties of ionomers for various molecular architectures is the key step, in the effort to create and identify the optimized polymer structure with improved transport- Using this approach, we propose to develop, optimize, and demonstrate improved fuel cell catalyst ionomers based on new molecular architectures that will have dramatic improvements compared to current ionomers such as PFSA materials through a combination of higher conductivities, improved water permeability, increased oxygen and hydrogen permeabilities to reduce the mass transport related resistance observed all while continuing to be compatible with other ionomer materials including PFSA exhibiting durability and minimizing the potential for adsorption on platinum-"

        "abstract": "Trabus Technologies (TRABUS), working with Louisiana State University (LSU), will develop a predictive analytics-based US Inland Waterways Voyage Planning Analysis tool to help vessel traffic managers, tow boat pilots, and river lock operators maximize transport logistic resources. This tool will use current and forecasted hydrographic, meteorological, lock status, and Marine Safety Information to help commercial cargo operators and the Marine Industry determine optimal barge loading and tow configuration for any specified commodity\/cargo movement. When planning any journey using US Inland Waterways, commercial cargo operators must manually consider a vast range of complex factors to determine optimal load for every vessel to ensure efficient and safe passage for its entire journey, which often includes rapidly-changing environmental conditions. For example, a 4-inch change in river level (from rain a week after departure) correlates to a 72-ton variance in a large barge\u2019s capacity; operators must predict this change or risk hundreds of thousands of dollars of revenue per journey. A machine learning based predictive tool to rapidly process current and forecasted conditions would provide the Marine Industry with greater voyage planning and efficient transport management. Developed by TRABUS for the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), the River Information Services Enterprise (RISE) provides the technical framework enabling collection, integration, and exchange of navigation and vessel logistics information for safe, efficient, reliable, and environmentally responsible navigation between the Marine Industry and Government. Develop predictive algorithms and data-driven analytics for a commercial cloud-based Voyage\/Transport Planning Service to maximize transport commodities and minimize intermodal transfers. Leverage ongoing RISE BigData efforts to analyze data from US Geological Survey (USGS), USACE Lock Performance Monitoring System, US Coast Guard\u2019s Notice to Mariners, and Marine Industry\u2019s barge, vessel, commodity, and supply chain data. LSU will leverage its ongoing BigData expertise with NOAA, National Weather Service, and USGS data to develop the methodology."

However, the HPC requirements behind these models remain beyond the reach of most businesses involved in this small yet vital field impacting National security. RMD is proposing to migrate HPC codes having value in detector development to more accessible platforms, such that manufacturers might avail their capabilities and speed development. The time consuming aspects of crystal growth dominate aspects of this field, limiting the number of materials evaluated and experimental permutations. The program goal is to make computational modeling a more integral part of this process, by reducing computational complexity and moving to more economical and accessible platforms."

        "abstract": "Society at large and DOE in particular have an interest in the continued development and refinement of a smart grid infrastructure that more efficiently and reliably matches electrical resources to demands. While technological advances in recent years have improved the smart grid, these advances have been limited by a lack of granularity of data (e.g. environmental conditions at multiple locations in a space) and control (e.g. ability to control every light in a room independently). This proposal focuses on providing this missing granular data by collecting user-location specific (ULS) data that can be utilized by relevant building systems and ultimately by the smart grid. ULS data can allow for more sophisticated control algorithms for loads (such as lighting and air conditioning) so that total energy use is reduced while individual users receive services (e.g. light levels, temperatures) that better meet their needs. Additionally, when building control systems that rely on ULS data are tied to the smart grid, they can reduce loads when needed (e.g. during peak load events) in a manner that maximizes load shedding while still providing individual users the service levels they need."

        "abstract": "One of grand challenges in nanoscience and nanotechnology is to achieve fundamental under- standing of the dynamic evolution of materials in actual operating environment, non-equilibrium conditions, or undergoing chemical reactions at the nanoscale. This requires forefront advances in imaging and analysis techniques that combine nanometer-scale spatial resolution, optical excitation and spectroscopic detection for direct in-situ observation of the fundamental processes. The proposed innovation is in-situ nanoscale imaging method by integrating tip-based near-field scanning optical microscopy with femtosecond multiphoton spectroscopy, and by expanding its operational temperature beyond conventional range. First, the laser-heated stage enables high temperature operation up to 1000K since radiative heating can be precisely controlled and con- fined to a small volume at a short period of time. Second, design concepts and fabrication methods of near-field optical probe that is compatible with such extreme temperature are proposed, which is based on transparent, heat-resistant, and durable materials. Third, in-situ probe cleaning is applied to prolong the lifetime of optical probe and enhance the usability and reliability in harsh operating conditions."

        "abstract": "This project will develop a flexible longitudinal electron optical system based on high-precision radio-frequency cavities for short and intense electron bunch compressions, both in the energy and time domains. The proposed system is designed to be insertable into an existing transmission electron microscope column to upgrade its temporal resolution. Active phase-space control enables broad ranges of material, nanoscience and technologies applications involving highly demanding ultrafast core-level spectroscopy and ultrafast single-shot material research. The high-dose mode is currently not feasible in commercial systems. While the basic concept has been demonstrated in a customized electron optical column, adapting the same technologies into an existing electron microscope will require delicate design and laboratory tests to ensure robust performance. Niowave, Inc. built the resonant cavity used as a radio-frequency buncher at the test facilities at Michigan State University that were used to demonstrate the concepts of active space-charge control. In this STTR project, Niowave and MSU will partner to develop the next realization of this radiofrequency (RF) lens and make this technology available as a drop-in upgrade for existing commercial electron microscopes. This realization would revolutionize the future of electron microscope design, and could even transform an aging fleet of steady-state electron microscopes into powerful ultrafast imaging and spectroscopy instruments. These systems would be widely used in industrial and academic settings for material characterizations."

        "abstract": "The Neutron Spin Echo (NSE) method has provided unique information about the dynamics of soft materials, including confirmation of the de Gennes model of polymer reptation, and quantitative measurement of the bending constants of various membranes. In almost all cases these measurements have been made at small neutron scattering angles, where structural correlations with length scales between 10 nm and 100 nm dominate. However, existing NSE instrumentation is not well suited to studies, such as relaxation in spin glasses, solitary magnons in antiferromagnetic chains, the scale dependence of viscosity in ionic liquids, the diffusion of aromatic molecules in graphite, and short-range dynamics in comb- like polymers, where correlations over distances of 0.1 nm to 10 nm are important. To address the limitations of existing NSE instrumentation, the Institut Laue-Langevin (ILL) is building a major new instrument \u2013 WASP or Wide-Angle Spin Echo \u2013 that will be able to study motions of biological functional groups, diffusive dynamics, dynamics of molecular magnets, and dynamics of molecules confined in one or two dimensions. To achieve the same goals as WASP, we propose to design a compact device, based on high- temperature superconducting technology, which we developed for prior DOE-funded Phase I and II STTR projects. Our high-temperature superconducting Wollaston prisms have been used to build successful devices for Spin Echo Modulated Small Angle Scattering (SEMSANS), Larmor diffraction and phonon focusing."

        "abstract": "Although thermal and cold neutron scattering is widely used, and is critical for success in many areas of materials science and engineering, relatively low neutron fluxes severely limit applications of not only laboratory neutrons generators, but also large national neutron facilities. State-of-the-art thermal and cold neutron sources are large expensive national facilities, which serve diverse community of scientific and industrial users. The constant need to improve the instruments performance, stems from the fact that neutron methods are gaining in popularity, and becoming more and more powerful, while new neutron sources are not being constructed, so as to keep pace with the developments and needs of the scientific community. Small research reactors at universities and National Labs, and laboratory-based neutron generators, are necessary not only for education and training, but also when samples cannot be transported to other facilities. However, the standard neutron techniques, which were developed for high-flux facilities, require much higher efficiencies to be used effectively with the low fluxes of small sources. Thus, the efficient use of neutron sources, such as with our proposed analyzer, is important for the progress and broader use of these neutron techniques. We strive to achieve the goal of efficient use of available thermal and cold neutrons, by introducing here, novel analyzers for powder diffraction and stress-strain measurements. These analyzers will enable polychromatic cold and thermal neutron diffractometers, which will have much higher throughput than existing instruments. At large national facilities, such as at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, these analyzers would enable very fast instruments for screening of multiple samples, for measuring kinetic processes, or for measuring residual stress tensors."

        "abstract": "According to a report by the Hydrogen Council, a global lobby set up in January 2017 by Toyota and Air Liquide that includes 27 members such as automakers Audi, BMW, Daimler, Honda and Hyundai, and energy firms Shell and Total, increasing the use of hydrogen in power, transport, heat and industry could deliver around one fifth of the total carbon emissions cuts needed to limit global warming to safe levels by mid-century. Electrochemical hydrogen separation and compression (EHSC) technology can recycle and purify waste hydrogen and compress hydrogen to high pressures required for vehicle fuel storage, addressing needs facing the large and growing industry for hydrogen supply and use as a process gas or energy carrier. EHSC systems that are able to reach ultra- high pressures at low energy requirements can better meet the needs of the hydrogen vehicle fueling industry. Electrochemical systems offer the potential for hydrogen compression with greater reliability and lower costs than conventional mechanical systems due to their elimination of moving parts. The use of electrochemical cells in compressors is challenged by membrane stability under high pressure differentials, membrane tolerance to impurities, capital cost of membranes and catalysts, and risks of cell flooding due to membrane hydration requirements. Perfluorosulfonic acid ionomers such as Nafion have been the most widely tested proton exchange membrane (PEM) material. Recently, Dr. Chulsung Bae\u2019s group at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) has developed a new controlled polymer functionalization method based on functionalization of C-H bonds in polymer. This new synthetic method has allowed Bae\u2019s group to incorporate various types of ionic functional groups into polymers. Synthesis and characterization of these new ionic polymers has advanced understanding of relationships between chemical structure and performance of the materials at molecular level. The proposed DOE program will focus on the development of next-generation PEMs that enable hydrogen compression in SI\u2019s electrochemical hydrogen separation and compression system at the DOE goals of &gt; 1 kg\/hour at 875 bar with an energy consumption of 1.4 kWh\/kg, given hydrogen input at 100 bar."

        "abstract": "Nanotechnology has yet to live up to its promise of exploiting properties which emerge at the nanoscale because of the lack of manufacturing precision to control the nanoscale dimensions, thus denying society many energy saving materials and applications. This project targets a key component of an Atomically Precise Manufacturing system: a high-speed sub-nm-precision manufacturing platform for atomic precision patterning and hierarchical assembly using arrays of MEMS actuators. The overall objective of this project is to devise a platform for Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM)-based high-speed and high-throughput imaging and lithography. This will be done by designing the requisite hardware, software and control algorithms which comprise such a system. Our approach uses novel control systems and later, local digital control to enable large arrays. We will: (1) Design and build a high-speed 2Degrees Of Freedom atomic-precision nanopositioner for STM-based imaging and lithography. This nanopositioner will enable accurate positioning of the STM heads over the atomic lattice with an accuracy of \u00b11\u00c5. It will be equipped with feedback control loops to guarantee stability, robustness and repeatability of operation; (2) Design and build an array of on-chip Si On Insulator-MEMS STMs. Each device will have full STM functionality and will comprise a high-bandwidth 1 Degree Of Freedom MEMS nanopositioner that moves in the vertical direction to servo the gap between the tip and sample. These MEMS devices can be stacked in close proximity to one another so that they may be used collectively to image a large area or write a single large pattern; and (3) Design a feedback control system that ensures high-bandwidth parallel operation of the STM heads, and increases the tip lifetime during imaging and lithography."

        "abstract": "One of the major maintenance headaches causing increased operational cost in the production of mature oil wells is the elimination of wax and paraffin buildup in the production tubing. The accumulation over time of paraffin compounds in &quot;cold spots&quot; in the tubing creates high pressures and flow constrictions that contribute to accelerated pump wear, and constrict the flow of fluids to the surface. Currently paraffin formation (which restricts the recovery of hydrocarbons) is managed in a reactive manner when oil production is observed to decrease. Current methods of paraffin removal include hot oiling, chemical treatments and electric heaters powered from the surface with cables. We propose to address this problem proactively by preventing paraffin formation in the tubing by using a permanent magnet induction heater. This will increase hydrocarbon recovery from many of the hundreds of thousands of oil wells in the US. Unlike current methods, this method does not require any external intervention to remove paraffin. It prevents paraffin formation in wells by keeping the oil above the cloud point all the way to the surface. We have built and tested a proof of concept tool and all aspects of the tool perform as analyzed by transient EM Finite Element analysis. We have briefed several oil companies and several oil field tool manufacturers. The oil companies have offered advice on operational requirements and these directives have been incorporated in the design. The tooling companies have advised us to make the device \u201coil field tough\u201d which involves the selection of steel alloys for some components and the chemically compatible metals for other operational components."

        "abstract": "By 2025, 1.8 billion people will be living in places with severe water scarcity and two-thirds of the global population will encounter some degree of water stress. If warming continues at the current pace, by 2030 half of the world\u2019s population will experience severe water stress (Runte 2016). The demands are strong; the restraints, on the other hand, come from (1) high capital investment for equipment and for operation, (2) environment consideration on the discharge of brine water, and the most importantly (3) energy inefficient for the current technology under operation. These low energy efficiencies not only add up costs, but also accelerate the exhaustion of limited fossil fuels that are available. The development of innovative and capable technologies to (i) relieve the severe water stress people have already experienced, and (ii) minimize the impact of energy-inefficient processes that deteriorate the already-fragile environment, will, therefore, be extremely desirable. In response to the need for Technical Transfer Opportunities requested by the Department of Energy (DoE), a microfluidic flow manipulator, a passive means barely consuming additional energy, consisting of simple yet reliable structures that can be seamlessly implemented into the membraneless desalination device (US patent 20140183046 A1) is proposed. This innovative approach will readily double its current salt rejection rate of 25% to 50% (50% recovery) by the end of Phase I, and realize a portable system capable of generating 5-10 gallons per day with &gt; 99% salt rejection rate in three years."

        "abstract": "Ensuring adequate agricultural productivity in the face of an increasing human population is a major concern with implications for both production of bioenergy products (Jones and Hinsinger, 2008) and global food security. Increasing agricultural productivity requires a stronger understanding of soil biogeochemical processes that impact plant nutrient availability. We propose development of an innovative isotope sensor that will enable high spatial-resolution analysis (down to the microbe level) to target nutrient exchange in the rhizosphere. The concept uses laser ablation to sample specific locations in the roots and rhizosphere at the micron (\u00b5m) scale. The resulting, sample- derived ablation particulates are converted to a gas and then analyzed for isotopic content. Specifically, we propose using a novel, ultra-low volume isotope analyzer based on laser absorption spectroscopy, which will initially be used to analyze stable carbon isotope ratios (13C\/12C) at high spatial resolution. The resulting tool will enable studies designed to track uptake of isotope labeled 13CO2 from fixation into the plant and eventually through the roots and into the soil as root exudates. The concept builds on successful work in which laser ablation has been coupled to isotope ratio mass spectrometers (IRMS). The innovative aspect is that the IRMS will be replaced by a novel, more sensitive laser absorption spectrometer, which can analyze orders of magnitude smaller sample sizes, enabling smaller ablation spot sizes and improved spatial resolution. Furthermore, as compared to IRMS (as well as other isotope analyzers), our laser absorption spectrometer is more compact, lower power, and more amenable to potential field deployment."

        "abstract": "Finding better ways to measure rhizosphere properties has the potential to transform agriculture. Better understanding of the root-microbe-soil interactions that characterize the rhizosphere will help reduce fertilizer, pesticide, and herbicide inputs, improve effective carbon dioxide sequestration, enhance biofuel crop production, and lead to more efficient farms with higher profitability. But the rhizosphere is difficult to measure, requiring soil samples, complex spectroscopy, and other expensive and time-consuming procedures, which limit the pace of innovation.The device to be developed under this proposal overcomes these challenges, combining cutting edge root detection technology with an ingenious suite of inexpensive, single-band LED emitters\/detectors to replace mid-infrared spectroscopy. Unlike other approaches, like soil sampling, the device functions in the field and can monitor the rhizosphere continuously without human intervention. Phase I work aims to provide proof-of-concept evidence that the suite of single-band LED emitters\/detectors can replace mid-infrared spectroscopy and that LED emitters\/detectors can identify roots. These two endeavors will demonstrate that the proposed device can measure important soil properties near roots, in effect, measuring key rhizosphere properties"

        "abstract": "The overall goal of this STTR proposal is to establish a commercial microwell technology for high-throughput screening and characterization of interactions that are critical to plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) survival and function. PGPR can be used to improve crop stress tolerance by enhancing root function; providing nutrient uptake, nitrogen fixation, hormone regulation, and suppression of soil-borne pathogens. Treating crops with PGPR is a viable approach for economical and sustainable plant production. However, a major bottleneck to PGPR commercialization comes from poor survival and performance of PGPR strains when used in existing formulations. An improved understanding of critical PGPR interactions with native rhizosphere microbiome members will inform the development of more consistent and effective PGPR formulations. The technology platform consists of a microwell array system that forms 104 - 105 unique combinations between a fluorescently-modified test species and a defined collection of root microbiome members isolated from plant rhizosphere, then screens each well for survival and growth of the test species. Cellular material in wells that show symbiotic or antagonistic interactions with the test species is removed for genomic analysis to identify the members influencing the test species function. The goal of the Phase I proposal is to provide the existing microwell technology with new capabilities that are key to its commercial pathway. Objective 1 will adapt the technology towards screening interactions of known PGPR species in Populus rhizosphere networks. Objective 2 will develop a user-friendly, highly-automated image analysis tool that can rapidly quantify large data sets generated by the platform to identify wells containing important PGPR interactions. The software accessory is expected to dramatically enhance the utility of the existing microwell tool, moving it towards a marketable product. The project will also leverage a well-established collaboration with colleagues working in the DOE-funded Plant Microbe Interfaces Project at Oak Ridge National Laboratory to meet these objectives."

Specifically, the formation of ice in the atmosphere depends on the nature and abundance of ice nucleating particles, and has major implications for precipitation and cloud interactions with incoming solar radiation. Improved observational capabilities are required to advance understanding of ice nucleating particles, and there is a substantial gap between current needs and existing instruments, particularly those suitable for newly developed unmanned platforms. This project develops a new commercial instrument for measuring ice nucleating particles based on microfluidic techniques, which involve manipulating fluids on sub- millimeter scales. The small size and power requirements possible thanks to the use of microfluidic methods allow for the development of an instrument small enough for use on unmanned platforms."

        "abstract": "Currently the chemical composition of atmospheric particulate matter is measured either by off-line analyses of time-integrated filter samples, or by in-situ instruments requiring near-constant operator oversight. These measurement approaches result in sparse or limited data coverage. Despite the critical role of composition on the health and environmental impacts of particulate matter, there exist few time-resolved, long-term records of particle-phase chemical composition. New measurement approaches are needed that are robust, easy-to-operate, and suitable for DOE ARM and other atmospheric monitoring facilities for operationally-inexpensive measurements of particle composition. The proposed instrument will offer a robust and straightforward method for the on-line measurement of particle composition that provides moderate chemical and volatility detail with hourly time-resolution and little operator effort. This instrument will measure volatility-resolved particle-phase carbon and oxygen-to-carbon ratio, as well as inorganic sulfur, with the flexibility for future expansion to include nitrogen, phosphorous, or other atmospherically important elements. This instrument will provide hourly data of the parameters necessary for most existing models and descriptions of atmospheric particulate matter, with capital and operational costs that will allow substantially increased spatial and temporal extent of available data. Airborne particles from 0.005 - 2.5 micron will be captured as a concentrated \u201cspot\u201d deposit using our firm\u2019s unique moderate-temperature, water- based condensation method that has been demonstrated in collecting samples for off-line analysis. It will be adapted here for on-line analyses by engineering a compact sample collection and thermal desorption cell."

These include amplifiers, voltage regulators, analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and digital logic circuitry. However, radiation-tolerant high-speed ADCs currently cost more than\n$30,000 per channel and have a high power consumption. A novel high-speed radiation tolerant ADC is proposed, leveraging TallannQuest\u2019s patented rad-hard-by- design technology, offering significantly lower power consumption and smaller size than what is offered by the current state of the art. This will result in an order of magnitude lower cost per channel, and will allow for greater integration of multiple ADCs into a single integrated circuit (IC). Such integrated solution, which may represent an entire analog front-end for detectors used in nuclear physics experiments, as well is in other applications (e.g., satellite communications and medical imaging equipment), is an anticipated outcome from the extension of this Phase 1 research project into a Phase 2 project."

This project will develop a system to automate the production of alpha-emitting therapeutic radionuclides such as astatine-211 (211At).\nThese radionuclides have been identified as candidates in the treatment of leukemia and lymphoma. Existing manual methods are tedious, time consuming and pose risks to technicians. In this project, isolated and proof-of-concept steps in the multi-step chemical purification protocol will be engineered for inclusion in an integrated commercial system. The key unit operations necessary for this system will be examined and optimized.Diagnostic sensors will be developed and incorporated to ensure that the final system meets the standards of current Good Laboratory Practices (cGLP). Specifically, steps that employ solid phase extraction (SPE), neutralization, and de-watering of the conceived 211At purification process will be studied during phase I."

        "abstract": "The proposed Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) needs several high-field, large-aperture quadrupole magnets in the interaction region for the ion or proton beams- These magnetsshould (a) be able to tolerate high radiation loads, (b) be compact in size, with limited space for iron shielding, and (c) have a field-free region along the length of the magnet for the passage of electron beams- We propose to develop designs for EIC quadrupoles in Phase I based on racetrack coils satisfying the above requirements- In particular, we will examine a novel\u201cmodular design\u201d concept- The modular design is based on simple racetrack coils, which require less expensive tooling to build the magnets- However, unlike in many racetrack coil quadrupole designs, the modular design is similar to the Panofsky quadrupole design, which allows conductor at the mid-plane to be placed at a radius similar to that in conventional cosine two- theta quadrupoles- This difference in configuration is crucial to creating high field gradient- Moreover, the \u201cmodular design\u201d also enables a \u201cmodular R&amp;D program\u201d in which the same coils can be used in \u201cproof-of-principle\u201d magnets of different aperture- Such a \u201cmodular program\u201d should significantly reduce the cost of R&amp;D, which is a significant part of the overall cost of developing the small number of Nb3Sn magnets with different apertures- We propose to build a Proof-of-Principle demonstration magnet in Phase II-"

It will be able to retain input (stimulus) and output patterns for entire clock cycles, and therefore, reestablish the state of the device under simulation in a repeatable manner.VDATS TPS developers and maintainers can benefit greatly from the WesTest Hardware Modeler by using the actual Teradyne Di-series digital hardware to perform the simulation. This type of simulation is performed on the actual test equipment used for the TPS so accurate simulation results are achieved."

These techniques, while proficient at mitigating the specific threats they are designed to detect, offer little protection against modern file and document formats that allow for the embedding of arbitrary data.AIS proposes ABED to detect and prevent malware and exploits in less than five minutes by extending upon proven Machine Learning enabled exploit and malware detection techniques previously developed by AIS under Air Force contract TAFFI (FA8750-15-C-0017). By leveraging existing research, ABED will have out-of-the-box capability to detect threats embedded in various common file types that can be used as a foundation for endpoint defense.ABED research will focus both on improving the pre-existing TAFFI detector, and on using it to build an enterprise ready endpoint defense solution. We will develop a self-learning and continuous training capability for the detector, allowing it to quickly learn how to detect malware and exploits in new file formats. This self-learning detector will serve as the foundation of our approach, and around it we will design an endpoint defender that can use scalable enterprise computing resources when available but which can still defend endpoints in their absence."

Most existing cyber defense systems are still using the aged signature-matching techniques which can be easily avoided by current malware through polymorphic methods, such as obfuscation. In this effort, IAI proposes to develop DeepDefense, a deep-learning based cyber defense system to effectively detect and mitigate zero-day attacks. DeepDefense detects zero-day cyber-attacks by analyzing the software program behaviors which cannot be evaded by any polymorphic methods. DeepDefense utilizes a deep-learning based artificial intelligence method to automatically identify benign and malicious behaviors. DeepDefense will be implemented and run at the host end. Thus DeepDefense is network agnostic, and can provide uninterrupted security protection even under an encrypted network environment. The intrusion detection results from DeepDefense can be easily reported to an existing SIEM system to improve the security capabilities of mitigating zero-day attacks. Together, DeepDefense will provide advanced intrusion detection\/mitigation capabilities to enterprise networks, and provide continuous and uninterrupted security protection against zero-day attacks."

        "abstract": "The edge on the battlefield today comes from improved communications and real-time situational awareness. Current solutions relying on omni-directional antennas congest the RF space reducing the effectiveness of TCDL multi-node networks. In addition, the wide coverage pattern of an omni-directional antenna results in high probability of intercept, high probability of detection, and low protection from jamming. Using a directive mechanically gimbled antenna to solve the drawbacks associated with an omni-directional antenna will limit the number of supported communication links to the number of antennas capable of being installed on the platform, and drives SWaP-C to an unacceptable level.FIRST RFs proposes to address these drawbacks with an innovative multibeam active electronically scanned array (AESA) with integrated frequency conversion capabilities. The combination of FIRST RFs phased array antennas with integrated frequency conversion allows for a flexible system that is capable of up to four independent TCDL communication links while keeping the SWaP-C of the system at acceptable level. FIRST RF will also investigate extending the frequency conversion capability within the AESA to provide I\/Q analog baseband signals, or potentially digitized I\/Q signals, to enable the use of lower cost, or even software defined, radios."

In onedesign scenario, the MIMOnizer offers Range Extension Mode (REM) via link margin improvements realizable by appropriate MIMO modes such as Space Time Block Codes (STBC). In another scenario, the MIMOnizer offers High Capacity Mode (HCM) in addition to REM where it can boost the legacy TCDL radios original spectral efficiency up to the factor of N (number of antennas).Our plan for Phase I is an extensive software based simulation study that will investigate the benefits and performance gains of the available MIMO options under different scenarios. Wealso plan to do a preliminary hardware MIMO demo based on the Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) Software Defined Radios (SDRs), which will also serve as the basis for the Phase II work where we will implement the full features of the MIMOnizer applique."

        "abstract": "Makai Ocean Engineering, Inc. proposes to address thermal management performance shortfalls for 6th generation air platforms by developing a novel heat exchanger technology. Specifically, Makai will develop an ultra-compact foil based heat exchanger (FFHX) for air-cooled, two-phase vapor cycle systems. The FFHX will provide at least a 50% improvement in volumetric performance, pressure drops of less than 1psi, and lower weights compared to the current state-of-the-art.The FFHX manufacturing process uses advanced and high-precision techniques that enable use of thin foils (0.0015 inch), custom flow geometries, surface enhancements, elimination of backing plates and tension rods, and most importantly enabling irregular and non-rectilinear heat exchanger volume envelopes.Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations show air-convection coefficients of at least 350 W\/m2-K. Combined with surface area densities of 2000 m2\/m3, this results in more than 50% improvement in volumetric performance compared to the Honeywell metrics. Makai will work with LM Aero to achieve additional performance improvements by exploiting irregular, peripheral spaces in the air platform, which is not possible with current state-of-the-art units.Prototype plates have been pressure tested to over 500 psi at Makais facility in Hawaii, making this a relatively low-risk development and shortening the transition timeline for the USAF."

        "abstract": "Physical Sciences Inc. (PSI) will develop an innovative refrigeration condenser for airborne applications based on PSIs established fractal heat exchanger geometry. This configuration is 60% smaller and 20% lighter than comparable heat exchangers because it uses a branched feed network instead of pipe headers (the heaviest parts of existing heat exchangers).Test articles will be produced with a volumetric energy density of greater than 4.7kW\/L (60% better than current) and a specific power greater than 7.4 kW\/kg (20% better than current). These laboratory test samples will verify the performance of the design in preparation for full-scale testing in Phase II.PSIs condenser is light enough to be used on refrigeration-equipped aircraft to enable cooling of internal components. The condenser reduces aircraft drag because of its reduced cross-sectional area. It improves packaging within the aircraft due to its reduced overall volume. Together, these changes make it feasible to consider refrigeration as a means to increase internal heat loading on a 6th generation fighter airplane.The advances in mass, frontal area, and volume are made possible by PSIs novel geometry, which makes use of recently-developed numerical optimization techniques and additive manufacturing of metals."

To this end, Creare proposes to develop an ultra-compact, lamination-stack condenser with built-in air flow headers to substantially reduce the overall condenser assembly size and mass. The condenser has a unique configuration to simplify its integration with air ducts and thus minimize its installation envelope and mass. The condenser flow channels have features tailored along the flow direction to enhance the overall heat transfer while minimizing flow pressure drop increase. The proposed condenser assembly will achieve a volumetric heat capacity twice the current state-of-the-art condensers. In Phase I, we will first work with our OEM collaborator to identify a target application and develop design specifications. We will prove the feasibility of our approach by building and demonstrating a proof-of-concept subscale condenser, developing the Phase II condenser prototype design, and predicting its performance. In Phase II we will design, build, and demonstrate a laboratory condenser prototype under prototypical conditions and deliver the prototype to the Air Force for further performance evaluation."

However, mechanical computer-aided design (CAD) data preparation and manipulation continues to dominate most CAE activities, hindering the use of advanced engineering simulation tools, and resulting in excessive costs across a broad range of design and manufacturing activities. Recently, the animation industry has developed fast methods for generating 3-D renderings of parametric models using subdivision methods. These methods for rapidly generating polygonal surfaces from CAD show great promise when applied to grid generation since they may be tuned to ensure that continuity requirements are satisfied. The objective of this proposal is to demonstrate the feasibility of applying subdivision method to potentially automate the process for creation of multi block structured hexahedral meshes in a fully coupled definition between CAD models and discretized domain required by CFD tools."

        "abstract": "To ensure continued access to orbit for United States government and commercial payloads, attractive replacement candidates for foreign-made propulsion components must be identified and the associated technology matured. The innovation proposed herein will identify and further maturation of a domestically available, oxidation-resistant, high-temperature C\/SiC material candidate for launch vehicle applications. Materials Research and Design, Inc. (MR&amp;D) will leverage lessons-learned from an ongoing Air Force Space &amp; Missile Systems Center effort to explore the feasibility of a tape-wrapped preceramic polymer-derived C\/SiC (designated 16A, manufactured by Allcomp, Inc.) for liquid thrust chamber applications. A combined analytical and experimental program is proposed, during which manufacturing demonstration cylinders will be fabricated and ultimately, evaluated mechanically using the ring tension facility available at Southern Research. MR&amp;D will perform preliminary optimization of thrust chamber designs at both the full scale and sub-scale level, laying the groundwork for prototype fabrication during a Phase II program. A successful Phase I program will establish feasibility through fabrication of cylindrical demonstration articles and subsequent strength testing; thermal-structural feasibility will be established through finite element analyses of the C\/SiC material in relevant manufacturing and operational environments."

        "abstract": "To address the Air Forces need for a tool to evaluate, understand, and predict key influential technology areas within a multi-domain, Air Force-centric future challenge, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new Bayesian Multi-Domain Evaluation Tool (BAMDET) based on novel integration of a new analyst interface with a backend software component built around recent advances in proven Bayesian network theory. Specifically, the innovations in streamlined, Excel-based operator interfacing, and automated sensitivity analysis will enable the key Air Force commands to perform analysis of alternatives (AoA) faster and to develop high-value technologies with limited resources. As a result, this technology offers an analytical capability to overcome challenges in identifying which mission and multi-mission system of systems (SoS) provide the greatest value, which directly address the Department of Defenses requirements for informed AoA. In Phase I, POC will demonstrate the feasibility of BAMDET by developing a methodology to include uncertainty in the conditional probabilities of Bayesian networks, describe how this methodology can be applied to the Air Forces development planning process, and provide an example of how it can be used to estimate the effectiveness of alternatives. In Phase II, POC will develop and implement a delivered BAMDET tool."

        "abstract": "Development planning is a critical task in the US Air Force (USAF) that is required to efficiently acquire new and improved vehicles, analyze strategic and tactical gaps in the USAFs missions, guide investment strategies of new technologies, and plan for future workforce skills. One of the key development planning tasks is analyzing the impacts of alternative designs on the potential system of systems (SoS) concept of operations (CONOPs), its ability to meet the desired measures of performance and effectiveness (MOPs\/MOEs), and the sensitivity of the system to various internal and external factors. Yet performing this analysis is difficult and costly due to the complexity and variety of systems, as well as the uncertainty within and impacting the systems. Bayesian networks (BNs) have been used to satisfy these development planning. However, BNs are insufficient as a technological base because of their rigid structure and limited support for advanced analysis. To address these development planning gaps in multi-domain USAF systems and operations, Charles River Analytics proposes a method for Probabilistic Programming for Analyzing Complex Systems (PPACS). This comprehensive, generalized tool uses advanced probabilistic programming languages and probabilistic relational models to support a wide variety of development planning needs. This will enable systems"

DE will improve acquisition, management, and engineering of defense systems throughout their lifecycles. Realizing these benefits will require deployment of an ecosystem that will impact people, process, tools and IT infrastructure; and incur related costs.Many architectures are possible for the DE ecosystem. Each architecture will satisfy different stakeholder needs and incur different costs at different times. We propose the development of an Integrated Dynamic DE Ecosystem Cost-model (IDEC) that models costs at an enterprise level and supports analyses of alternates. We will identify gaps between DE IT needs and existing DoD capabilities. Costs to fill IT capability gaps will be incorporated into IDEC. Ecosystem deployment costs for people and processes will be incorporated into IDEC. IDEC will model risks and support sensitivity analysis.IDEC will address stakeholder budgeting requirements and support analysis across types of appropriations. We will define and prioritize potential cost model outputs and develop a methodology to analyze costs. Phase I will demonstrate this methodology using a Microsoft Excel model. Phase II will develop an efficient web-based software tool to automate cost model analysis."

Optimized Mesh-networking Platform Navigation (OMPIN) is hereby proposed to support networked heterogeneous munitions equipped with a disparity of sensing capabilities. The design of OMPIN takes advantage of the fact that the navigation states of one weapon is practically decoupled from anothers, making it possible to implement an atomic decentralized estimation in which individual nodes first estimate their own state using measurements aboard and then apply inter-nodal measurements. In the decentralized filter, each node only estimates its own navigation state, not its neighboring nodes, thus being scalable. However, it takes into account the uncertainty of those assisting states as well as cross-correlation between nodes in contact. In Phase I, the proposed OMPIN technology will be developed and evaluated via computer simulation together with mutual aiding between networking and navigation. Radio systems suitable for ad hoc networking with inter-nodal measurements will be studied for prototyping in Phase II."

This new formulation has a high specific impulse and density specific impulse while simultaneously retaining the detonative performances of modern explosives. This unique low-cost energetic material will provide the thrust requirements and throttleability in a munition system using a simple grain geometry. In Phase I, the dual mode energetic materials ballistic and explosive efficacy will be quantified to define specific performance metrics to demonstrate operational feasibility. The results from this activity will serve to define critical system level parameters of the targeted prototype munition system demonstration in Phase II."

The system will be based on a biologically inspired compound eye, with built-in small-FOV (&lt; 3 degree) apertures to block sunlight and prevent blooming in sensitive imagers, using an active system with moving pigments that blocks or attenuates sunlight on demand. Biological systems such as these cannot be mimicked simply and directly with existing processes. Thus, a pair of gradient-refractive-index (GRIN) lenslet arrays will be fabricated that break the FOV into subapertures with a tight focal plane between them, and an electrophoretic light-attenuating cell array (ELACA) will be fabricated to block the light at the beam waist before it is delivered (via the second lenslet array) to the imaging camera. Lenses in an array will be varied, or chirped, as needed (each being different than its neighbor) to reduce wide-angle aberrations. Light transmission will be nearly 100% in the off state, and about 10 nJ will be used for each on\/off cycle."

Bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) are unique materials that combine properties of ultrahigh strength metals with processability of thermoplastics, which is often paired with other attractive attributes, such as high resilience, fracture toughness, hardness, and corrosion, erosion, and wear resistance. This project is focused specifically on thermoplastic forming (TPF) of BMGs that enables a wide range of geometries and functionalities in BMG products that are not possible to achieve with other materials and processing methods. The goal for Phase I is to mature and advance commercial opportunities for TPF of BMGs specifically for structural and functional space applications and, in later phases, for other areas of aerospace and defense. The scope of work includes an assessment of the overall advancement in the field of bulk metallic glasses, prioritization of applications, proving feasibility of the proposed methods, and developing a proof-of-concept for several BMG products with plans for manufacturing and insertion into spacecraft design."

        "abstract": "The amount of cross-domain data available to the designer today, and the speed at which it continues to grow is unprecedented. The data often come from heterogeneous sources that were developed independently, without a consensus on the syntax or semantics. The integration of the heterogeneous data is possible because of the access to its respective metadata, or data about data. The availability of vast amounts of cross-domain data led to the development of the Big Data (BD) technologies - a wide range of new standards, processing paradigms, architectures and frameworks, that are being actively applied in virtually all domains. BD tools are capable of discovery, interpretation, and communication of meaningful patterns in vast amounts of data. The analytics utilize algorithms from across different fields, such as distributed machine learning, data mining, pattern mining or computer vision, to name a few. The challenge of comprehending entire DT goes well beyond the scope of the proposed work. VIStology and Raytheon are proposing to focus primarily on the Capabilities-Based Assessment and develop methods and tools that leverage Big Data Analytics (BDA) supported by semantic technologies to extract and link design artifacts from common engineering documents to conduct trade space exploration."

        "abstract": "Spent Rocket Bodies (SRB) from decades of launch of satellites into Earth orbit are the largest component of space debris by mass, and they may pose a significant present and future threat to operation of space systems in certain orbits. Most of these objects will remain in place for several more decades before they re-enter the Earths atmosphere and eventually burn up. Recognizing the broader challenges of space debris, multiple organizations have created concepts for mitigating that debris and de-orbiting space junk. The concepts include attaching propulsion modules, electrodynamic tethers, and drag enhancement devices including sails and balloons. USAF is interested in long term reduction in the number of large SRBs in low earth orbits, especially near-polar and sun synchronous orbits to help preserve and extend the effective use of space. Vishwa Robotics proposes a completely novel, low cost, use and lose, miniature space craft that will engage a tumbling SRB and stabilize it and perform a controlled deorbiting maneuver without use of any external tether or power source like solar panels, RTGs etc., except a small battery."

System architecture trades will survey the space debris population to establish a detailed set of design requirements and to drive initial structural and packaging analyses.These efforts will necessarily be performed in close communication with sail and boom material vendors to identify practical and cost-effective designs."

        "abstract": "The potential for damage resulting from a collision with orbital debris in Low Earth Orbit has become a significant danger to active, viable space missions. Policies intended to curb the debris growth rate are being overwhelmed by the rapid growth in small satellites.The preponderance of these satellites has a short mission life, often 12-20 times shorter than the expected time those objects will remain in orbit. A projected growth in small launch vehicles will compound the problem by increasing the quantity of rocket bodies in orbit. Rocket bodies are of particular concern because they pose a significant risk for fragmentation. MMA has successfully demonstrated an effective de-orbit system on a small launch vehicle upper stage. DragNET systems accelerate the orbital decay by 10x or more, but are designed to be launched with the object it will bring down. MMA proposes the development of a Space In-situ Deployed Engagement Re-Entry (SpIDER) dragNETTM or SpIDERNETTM that incorporates an atmospheric drag membrane with an autonomous engage and deploy capability that requires no power after deployment. This integrated system would enable a host satellite to identify a desired debris target and de-orbit the object, reducing the potential for collision and debris propagation risks."

        "abstract": "With the growing complexity of ICs, interconnects become a bottleneck due to parasitics that cause cross-talk, wave reflection phenomena, and timing inaccuracies.Rapid advances are being made in utilizing optical interconnects in ICs where high speed signaling and routing are extremely important. Optical interconnects have advantages of high interconnect density, low energy consumption, and high speed timing capability. In this proposal, we plan to study die extraction and reassembly (DER) of hybrid photonic integrated circuits to replace passive devices and obsolete packaged ICs on a circuit board to increase high-speed routing of information in packaged ICs.DLP7000, a popular Digital Micro-mirror Device from TI is chosen for demonstrating the DER process in this phase 1.The DLP7000 is used widely in displays, medical devices, lithography, and 3D printing and serves a versatile model containing optical, mechanical and electronic components.We plan to accomplish the DER through a comprehensive and systematic approach where we will a) initially assess and develop suitable DER techniques, then; b) refine and re-evaluate, as needed and finally; c) implement the DER of the selected photonic IC on Si substrate and perform testing to full compliance with MIL-STD-883."

The expenses associated with any space launch areenormous and, once in orbit, a system failure can have catastrophic consequences. ExtensiveEarth-based testing is essential to ensure a high success rate. To approximate the demands of space deployment, the Air Force maintains large test chambers capable of creating low temperature, high vacuum environments. However, the motion control mechanisms within these chambers are often poorly suited to the harsh cryo-vac environment, and failures are not uncommon. A program of applied research is proposed to develop a family of versatile, high-precision positioning systems fully compatible with space chamber environments. Under Phase II, research will continue into motion technologies that are inherently more compatible with cryo-vac conditions and design strategies with the potential for further improving the performance of these technologies. Ultimately, a six degree-of-freedom Tri-Sphere positioning system will be built and validated."

In order to reach set field and depot inspection intervals, the minimum detectable flaw size (Andi) must be sufficiently small. Legacy NDT methods with Andi&apos;s that are too large require out of cycle inspections which are extremely costly in terms of both aircraft availability and maintenance man-hours. This program will adapt the JENTEK MWM-Array sensor and jET handheld impedance instrument to achieve Andi values that are sufficiently small for the selected NDT Individual Aircraft Tracking (IAT) locations such that the inspections can be transitioned from the field cycle to the longer programmed depot maintenance (PDM) cycle. IAT locations with both surface cracks and subsurface cracks will be addressed. Performance at the selected IAT locations will be validated through probability of detection (POD) studies. The MWM-Array is also expected to reduce false indications which have been excessive for some conventional eddy current testing (ET) inspections. JENTEK will deliver to the Air Force two second generation jET handheld systems configured for the selected IAT locations."

The goal for the Phase II is to enhance the existing software to address system robustness, improve computational efficiency and accuracy, and provide an operationally capable system to automate target tracking in challenging environments. The enhanced software will result in improved system and tracking performance to provide new insights in areas of vast uncertainty."

Consideration will be given to span of performance of the various approaches, scaling, staging and combination options, and systems constraints.

The ES3 LHE alkaline Zn-Ni plating process is showing excellent performance results in Phase I based upon feasibility testing to date for adhesion, corrosion protection, lubricity and conductivity testing; producing a coating that performs as good as or better than cadmium plating.In Phase II, ES3 will conduct testing identified in the Phase I effort to accomplish successful development and validation required for future implementation of the LHE alkaline Zn-Ni plating process developed in Phase I of this project for replacing cadmium plating on aluminum and steel electrical connectors, back-shells and components."

        "abstract": "A novel hybrid acoustic emission (AE) and guided wave (GW) inspection approach for radar towers inspection is presented. Keeping aging radar sites (many are over 50 years old) in good repair is important because they are critical intelligence components that provide advanced aircraft notification. This proposed work will continue development of new, patent-pending shear-type AE sensors, and apply methods to supplement passive AE inspection with active GW inspection on radar towers. In Phase I, the use of new, dual AE-GW shear-type sensors has shown improved performance over conventional AE sensors in several areas, including source localization accuracy and decreased sensitivity to environmental noise. Lower noise levels are important because times of high environmental noise (e.g., storms) often correspond to times of damage progression due to large external forces. Additionally, the sensors use the shear wave velocity for location calculations, simplifying the process and removing a source of user error. A hybrid AE-GW inspection technology has the potential to revolutionize the traditional AE market, allowing inspection redundancy and significantly improved damage classification. Phase II efforts will make great strides towards the commercialization of this technology with continued development of new shear sensors and demonstration of successful remote radar tower inspection."

        "abstract": "Sudden structural failure caused by stress corrosion cracking (SCC) in aircraft components is becoming a severe safety threat to Air Force aircraft and other aviation vehicles. Detection of SCC often occurs late in the damage development cycle, in which fast-growing macroscale cracking has already developed. This significantly increases depot maintenance cost and can negatively impact aircraft availability and integrity. Therefore, early detection of SCC in an aircraft component is a key element of fleet maintenance operations that has a tremendous impact on mission readiness, safety, and life cycle cost. Earlier planning of maintenance operations will allow for more effective logistics and maximization of mission readiness. Guidedwave proposes a nonlinear ultrasonic guided wave technology for detection of SCC. A hand-held probe will be used for small and wide area identification of early-stage SCC on both flat and curved surfaces of aircraft components. The probe will detect early-stage SCC so that it can be repaired prior to macrocrack formation. The probe will then verify that the repaired area is free from SCC damage. Phase II will focus on development of a prototype portable SCC detection system for demonstration on multiple Air Force platforms."

        "abstract": "Air Force landing gear systems are subjected to surface treatment processes (e.g., chrome plating, cadmium plating, anodizing) an indefinite number of times throughout their service life. During these processes, components are exposed to environments and chemicals which affect material surface conditions (e.g., roughness, residual stresses, microstructure) and reduce fatigue life. This reduction in fatigue life has not been quantified in Air Force digital fatigue analysis (DFA) models. In order to increase the accuracy of Air Force DFA models, Phase II efforts will continue the development of k factors which represent the fatigue life debit due to processing (once or multiple times) and refine the methods\/tools for determining k factors. Additionally, the Phase I prototype user interface for k factor input to HBM nCode (DFA software used by the Air Force) will be further developed in Phase II. The use of k factors in DFA models will aid in determining the conditions for timely removal of landing gear components from service to reduce risks and associated costs. Risks include both the removal of landing gears before it is necessary as well as potential catastrophic failures if left in service too long. As aircraft are pushed further beyond their original design life"

We first propose to conduct a systematic and in-depth investigation of autoignition-assisted flame stabilization and flame propagation and flame\/turbulence\/acoustics\/thermochemistry interactions on a transverse reacting propane jet by conducting high-speed, burst-mode Tomo-PIV measurements, dual-plane OH-PLIF imaging, two-color OH-PLIF thermometry, CH2O\/OH-PLIF imaging as well as tomographic imaging of OH* chemiluminescence. This will generate unprecedented benchmark databases on turbulent combustion with unambiguous determination of the nine-component strain-rate tensor, the flame stretch rate, the flame curvature and the flame orientation. Then, we shall focus on jet breakup, atomization, evaporation, droplets\/vapor\/oxidizer mixing, spray autoignition and turbulent spray combustion at afterburner-realistic conditions by performing high-speed, burst-mode Tomo-PIV measurements, tomographic imaging of ligaments and droplets, OH\/fuel-PLIF imaging, fiber-coupled illumination of the jet column as well as tomographic imaging of OH* chemiluminescence. The proposed research aims to substantially advance state-of-the-art understanding of turbulent combustion with both gaseous and liquid fuels, combustion instabilities, flame stabilization and blowoff in afterburners and other combustion\/propulsion systems."

It also develops a hierarchical framework to investigate the effects of these micromechanics defects on the interlaminar strength and fatigue life of curved composite structures. The overall effort is categorized into three parts: (i) Process Modeling part that deals with the initial transient phase until the cure cycle is completed, (ii) Performance Modeling part that investigates the fatigue integrity of composites with embedded voids and wrinkles, and (iii) Experimental Program on CT imaging and microscopy, that are applied in novel way to extract porosity data at early stage, and fatigues testing with wrinkled specimens along with DIC to extract residual interlaminar properties. Process modeling employs a two-pronged approach: A discrete micro-level (fiber-matrix level) approach, and a locally-homogenized macro-level (ply level) approach. A unique feature of our computational method is seamless and uniform coupling of the various hierarchical models in a variationally consistent fashion. A combined modeling, analysis and experimental validation program will help with the calibration of theoretical and computational models as well as for sensitivity analysis of modeling parameters."

        "abstract": "This STTR Phase II project will develop a hierarchical visual processing system and attention-based mechanisms based on novel 3D convolutional neural networks to enable robust and efficient detection and classification of objects in 3D LIDAR imagery. The Phase II will build upon the enabling technologies developed in Phase I which, using deep learning methods, model the ventral pathway of the visual cortex and address many limitations of the state-of-the-art solutions that perform exhaustive search for the targets of interest and rely on pre-designed features. Our system uses bottom-up and top-down attentional mechanisms to improve the efficiency of the framework and enable incorporation of prior models and available context for efficient performance. Moreover, instead of using hard-coded features, the system is capable of learning hierarchical invariant 3D feature representations that are object class independent from training datasets. The Phase II effort will include improving the core technologies, optimizing and porting the technologies for efficient processing to handle large 3D LIDAR datasets, and demonstration of the technologies. The project will benefit from Novateur Teams expertise in the areas of biologically inspired cognitive systems, attention-based vision, 3D deep learning and convolutional neural networks as well as sensor exploitation."

        "abstract": "To address the Air Force need for an automated target recognition (ATR) capability that uses Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR), Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to advance the development of the Highly Parallel LIDAR-based Automated Target Recognition (PLATR) system, which was proven feasible in Phase I. PLATR is based on an innovative combination of target isolation, target pose estimation, and target recognition methods that can be computed in a parallel manner. In Phase I, POC demonstrated the feasibility of the PLATR technology by developing and testing a prototype system that successfully detected (cueing) and recognized (classification) military vehicles in LIDAR point cloud data. We demonstrated 98.5% probability of correct classification of military vehicles. Specifically, we have shown that the innovation in efficient and parallel point cloud data processing for ATR will enable the PLATR system to reliably detect military ground vehicles in a variety of landscapes. As a result, this technology offers high probability of detection and real-time operation in a low size, weight, and power (SWaP) processing hardware, which directly addresses the Air Force requirements. In Phase II, POC plans to build and demonstrate a TRL-6 prototype implemented in a low SWaP processing hardware."

        "abstract": "The objective of the proposed Phase II is to mature, evaluate the performance of, and demonstrate the innovative Continuous High Pulse Repetition Frequency (HPRF) waveforms and processing techniques that were developed during Phase I. Technology Service Corporation (TSC) and its team of Space Dynamics Laboratory (SDL) and KeyW Corporation will perform the technical effort using analytical methods, modeling and simulation, hardware bench testing and radar data collection. In Phase I, the most promising Continuous HPRF technique was successfully demonstrated using KeyWs ground-based Sahara radar testbed against both ground vehicles and airborne targets of opportunity. During Phase II, TSC will further refine the Continuous HPRF techniques and demonstrate them in actual air-to-air encounters. SDL will implement representative HPRF fighter radar waveforms in their X-band airborne testbed, and collect air-to-air radar data against controlled aircraft targets. KeyW will configure the Sahara or X-band Gotcha Spiral 2 testbed for future flight testing and conduct ground tests to verify the HPRF operation. The primary application is air superiority for the F35 and F22 fighters. The second application is wide-area radar surveillance to detect small Unmanned Air Systems and quadcopters on the battlefield.Other applications include protecting high value air assets from incoming missiles."

        "abstract": "QuinStar Technology, Inc. proposes to develop a low noise amplifier (LNA), operating at E-band frequencies (71-76 GHz), with optimized noise performance, enhanced linearity (high OIP3), and low power consumption. This will be accomplished by utilizing the latest state-of-the-art (SOA) device technology and innovative circuit techniques. The key to the noise performance is the short gate length (35 nm) InP HEMT device. For this technology, we propose to team with the industry leader, Northrop Grumman. Based on their models, simulations indicate MMIC noise figures of 1.1 dB at E-band frequencies. Recent measurements with low-noise InP MMICs from two different companies have largely substantiated these simulations. To enhance the amplifier linearity and reduce power consumption, we are proposing to employ the cascode circuit configuration. This technique has never been attempted before at these millimeter-wave frequencies. Simulations indicate that we can simultaneously improve the amplifier linearity while reducing the power consumption. In fact, 2-tone simulations indicate that we can increase the OIP3 to over 20 dBm with a chip power consumption of only 46 mW. Finally, this amplifier will be packaged using QuinStars SOA low-loss E-band waveguide packaging technology."

The DF&amp;NN ANOM intelligent system provides affordable data-driven and goal-driven real-time automated abnormality detection, characterization, event tracking, historical context reporting, multiple satellite status visualization, and event relationship discovery across multiple data sources. The operational payoff to JSpOC\/JICSpOC is real-time automated satellite status to include on-orbit attack detection and anomaly attribution to support SSA.In Phase 2 MarkLogic provides the aggregation of heterogeneous data into a common data platform and DF&amp;NN provides the increased personnel efficiency and cost reduction for SSA due to the new turnkey ANOM capability that will automatically determine when to retrain, what to retrain on, and when to promote to real-time operations for each satellite. The DF&amp;NN intelligent systems have been proven at TRL7 to learn normal patterns of life to detect abnormal measurand correlations or temporal behavior in State of Health (SOH) telemetry, space weather, space catalog, and other data. DF&amp;NN Smoking Gun tools discover unknown correlations amongst events from multiple sources. Abnormality Detection Classification Viewer (ADCV) provides historical context, ringer suppression, tailored event tracking, raw data strip charts, and abnormal correlation culprits."

        "abstract": "The aircraft Nondestructive Inspection Section, 76 AMXG\/MXDEN needs a more efficient and effective means to track surface inspections, specifically Ultrasonic (UT) thickness measurements.UT thickness inspections are part of a daily workload for 76 AMXG\/MXDEN and can occur on each aircraft that is inspected.Close-range, hand-held UT thickness measurement are currently recorded manually using pencil and grid paper.These measurements are used to map out corrosion or the remaining thickness of blended areas on wing and body skin.The handwritten recordings provide limited contextual information of the inspection area about the aircraft. Additionally, the burden of spatially translating the recordings introduces more delays for 76 AMXG\/MXDEN customers.Cybernet Systems Corporation developed an innovative Tracker technology under SBIR contract with NASA Langley from 2010-2013 to track and localize NDI sensors in six degrees of freedom.Following further Cybernet investment and successful demonstrations of the technology from 2014-2015, Tinker AFB confirmed interest in transitioning the Tracker to enhance their surface inspections and deliverables.During this effort Cybernet will integrate the Tracker with existing NDI inspection equipment, and harden the Tracker for rapid setup and execution under every circumstance to provide mobile, color-mapped C-Scan generation."

Moving antennas away from Brigade and Battalion command posts is critical to improving their survivability against an opponent that can find and attack our command and control (C2) assets. Correctly designed, the same antenna remoting equipment can also improve command post agility with reduced setup and teardown times, plus simplify command post configurations. To achieve the best feasible and operationally desirable approach to antenna remoting, Syntonics applies our systems engineering expertise to: Perform an all-encompassing trade study of alternative methods for remote combat net radio\/antenna placement; Analyze approaches and opportunities for signal aggregation based on command post radio and platform distribution, and antenna aggregation for multiple transmitters and receivers; analyze the potential for aggregating transceivers by band; and Analyze packaging and power approaches for the remote systems. We develop a comprehensive white paper that substantiates findings, draws conclusions about how best to remote antennas and, during the Option period, develop a conceptual design for the Phase II prototype system."

        "abstract": "Many injuries in the battlefield are being treated by non-medical personnel(e.g. 42% of tourniquet applications are applied by non-medical personnel). Unfortunately, most non-medical personnel are not provided with opportunities to practice medical skills in a high stress environment prior to completing them during live missions. This lack of practice of critical skills is related to a need to focus training on the Warfighters primary MOS when completing integrated training and the high cost of practicing with medical mannequins. To meet this training gap and provide a low-cost and flexible training tool that allows all Warfighters to practice first response medical skills during high stress force-on-force training exercises, the Network Enabled Medical Training (NetEMT) Toolkit will be designed and developed. The proposed platform will evaluate trainee performance and provide essential cues using simulated medical equipment instead of mannequins. The NetEMT Toolkit will be designed the integrate with the Armys Live Training Engagement Composition (LTEC) to allow for the flow of force-on-force exercises to continue through medical first response. The design of the proposed system will be driven by a task analysis, cue fidelity evaluation, and training needs analysis."

Inclusion of other additives to conventional explosives and propellants upon reaction produce finely subdivided particles of metals (perhaps nanosize) as well as metallic vapors such as aluminum which allows for a fast combustion early in the detonation process thus enhancing blast as well as impulse.In the presence of propellants it can increase thrust and impetus. In the case of propellants preliminary GSI results show (20-30%) increase in impetus and measured projectile velocity; in the case of explosives (in arena tests) blasts and impulse enhancement as high as 50% were observed."

        "abstract": "To address the Armys need for a fire control radar for small UASs, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop an Advanced Fire Control Radar for Group 1 and 2 Unmanned Surveillance Systems (ARGUS). ARGUS is a compact, lightweight, and low power sensor that directly fits in the electronics or payload bay of Group 1 and 2 UASs. It interfaces with the platforms flight computer through standard UAS buses, through which it transfers the high fidelity radar information to a remote operator or the ground control station for visual confirmation and countermeasure. ARGUS innovative system design and algorithms provide (a) a device with large computational capability within a small form-factor that consumes low power, which is sufficient to detect, identify, and track threats with a low false alarm rate using radar cross-section data; and (b) a system with a platform-agnostic, low SWAP design which can be used in both Group 1 and 2 UASs. In Phase I, POC will design ARGUS and develop limited-scale benchtop hardware to show component feasibility. In Phase II, POC will develop a field ready, TRL-5\/6, UAV-mounted ARGUS with threat detection capability that can be demonstrated to a suitable customer for further transition."

These enable the radar to achieve 4 times more range than normal radar could do with the same output power. The IFT radar system is capable of detecting most group 1 UAV at 1 kilometer distance and group 2 at 1 mile. It can also identify the distance with high resolution as well as signal direction of arrival. IFT designed two different radar configurations. A fixed narrow beam radar system has low weight and size. It is suitable for a small group 1 UAV application.A 360 azimuth coverage radar is slightly larger and it can be easily deployed on a group 2 UAV,"

The proposed technology is versatile and amenable to designs for all types of pump combiners, including direct fiber bundle combiner and combiner with a signal fiber.Phase I will demonstrate enhanced coupling efficiency by producing a scaled down prototype with a 3-fiber combiner.A larger prototype with higher fiber count, with be tailored to critical DoD laser applications and will be built and extensively tested in the Phase II."

Such systems have the potential to remove first responders from harms way and improve the outcomes of combat casualties by enabling rapid CASEVAC in hostile conditions and environments. Multiple designs for such platforms exist. However, in addition to requiring active remote control for most tasks, these common-use platforms are likely unable to perform all necessary CASEVAC functions on their own. The DoDs recent push for multi-mission capable platforms suggests a different approach: employ groups of smaller UMS to support all required CASEVAC functions by leveraging advanced autonomy and collaborative teaming technologies. To meet this need, Charles River Analytics proposes to develop a modular hardware\/software Body-aware Robotic Appliqu for Collaborative Evacuation (BRACE). BRACE integrates cutting-edge capabilities in collaborative autonomy, manipulation, supervisory control, and perception, including precise 3D human pose and shape estimation, to ensure safe physical interaction with casualties. These capabilities will enable current and future UMS to maneuver safely and efficiently over land, collaborate with other platforms, and execute specific casualty evacuation tasks, such as lifting a patient to load a standard litter."

        "abstract": "Our service members deployed worldwide are at risk of exposures to local environmental and industrial toxicants which can potentially result in long-term adverse health effects. Understanding the impact of these exposures is critical for improved force protection and safeguarding individual soldier health. Capturing and classifying exposure data is essential for developing and implementing risk mitigation strategies. A longitudinal set of biosamples collected over a service members career is a rational strategy to generate an archival medical record which could serve to document exposures and health effects both during and after service. Dried blood spots (DBS) on filter papers represent an effective medium for collection and storage of blood samples in the clinical setting, but cannot be effectively translated to field conditions due to logistical challenges of collection, storage, transporation and ensuring sample stability under hot and humid conditions. Lynntech proposes to develop an innovativespecimen collection and storage platform which will circumvent these limitations of DBS for exposure tracking, but still utilize the basic DBS technology for blood collection, preservation and transportation. Lynntechs envisioned product will enable effective specimen collection and preservation in the fieldwhile also streamlining processing workflow to reduce current logistical hindrances."

The envisioned torsion bar systems will better meet the warfighters needs by providing the ability to actively vary vehicle ride height and spring rate, thus extending vehicle tractive capabilities. Corvid is uniquely positioned to provide a clear path to the realization of the Armys goal for this effort based on a number of key attributes, including our:Close association with the program leads of many of the U.S. militarys tracked vehiclesHistory of working with the OEMs of many of the heavy combat systemsHistory of working on detailed models that include accurate torsion bar systemsKnowledge of and experience with suspension systems in military vehicles subjected to extreme loading conditionsAdvanced materials backgroundAdvanced numerical modeling techniques"

        "abstract": "Combat Lifesavers (CLS) and Combat Medics (68W) are the first responders of the battlefield, and their training and skill maintenance is extremely important to the military. Scenario-based training is limited in how casualties and wounds are presented to trainees, and the amount of hands-on experience that trainees can get in the schoolhouse. Typically wounds are created using simple moulage that looks unrealistic, and does not change over the course of treatment. Furthermore, casualties are played by mannequins or human role-players, so they do not exhibit the physical or mental conditions associated with the injury. To improve the realism of 68W and CLS scenario-based training, SoarTech and UCF propose to develop the Combat Casualty Care Augmented Reality Intelligent Training System (C3ARESYS). C3ARESYS will provide trainees the opportunities to train on wounds and casualties that respond to their treatments while providing feedback to the trainee adapted to the trainees skill level. C3ARESYS will also offload work from the instructor, enabling focus on teaching rather than fixing shortcomings in casualty simulation. In Phase I, we designed C3ARESYS and assessed feasibility; in Phase II, we will build and evaluate a prototype of C3ARESYS and work toward transitioning C3ARESYS to a program of record."

        "abstract": "Megacities are rapidly becoming the epicenter of human activity. Their combination of dense terrains and highly interconnected systems requires a different skillset compared to those required for more conventional US military operations. Given the scale and complexity of megacities, real-world training is impractical and beyond the capabilities of the tools currently supporting Live Virtual Constructive (LVC) environments. Therefore, a new framework that integrates a multitude of models and high fidelity graphics is necessary to create effective training in a megacity environment. In Phase I, Charles River Analytics created this framework, designing and prototyping a Multi-Resolution Modeling and Simulation Toolkit (MultiMAST). In Phase II, we will extend MultiMAST, combining multi-paradigm, multi-resolution modeling with a cloud-based platform and 3D gaming engine to provide persistent, reality-scale simulations of a megacity. From citywide political, economic, and sociocultural systems to street-level physical behavior, the MultiMAST platform will provide a next-generation simulation platform to support LVC training in dense urban environments. Built using extensible and reusable component models, MultiMAST will support non-expert trainers developing, executing, and sustaining effective training programs to address the new challenges posed by megacity environments."

        "abstract": "Tactical Combat Casualty Care (TCCC) is essential for the Department of Defense during force-on-force engagements, but training is currently lacking. While traditional classroom instruction and high-fidelity simulation center training are important, they fail to provide practice in a larger exercise under field conditions in which the realities of combat impact medical treatment. Furthermore, though force-on-force live training events provide controlled settings in which soldiers experience simulated real-world scenarios, they focus on wartime mission-essential task lists and combat operations that are designed to increase collective unit proficiencies while providing only rudimentary TCCC training. Consequently, combat lifesavers and combat medics can only notionally reenact TCCC medical procedures to address common battlefield injuries on other soldiers, who are healthy untrained surrogate patients. With the focus on mission training, there is less regard for individual medical skills training. To address these requirements, we propose to design and demonstrate a system to provide Medical Augmented Reality for Combat Casualty Care (MARC). MARC provides in-situ tactical combat casualty care training and assessment during live force-on-force training events through the application of modern augmented reality (AR) technologies."

WiSPR can be quickly applied by a combat medic or soldier to provide real-time health status monitoring using a secure wireless connection. Additionally, the patch will provide interfaces by which to select operational profiles to maximize accuracy and response time (in the case of an injured soldier) or maximize endurance and battery life for over multiple days of extended use. Because of its low cost, WiSPR can be liberally distributed over a wide range of locations on the body and discarded after use. Based on the physiological signals measured, the patch dynamically determines where on the body it is located and uses this information to filter the data collected. Filtered patch data can then be fused statistically with data from other patches on the body to produce more accurate combined health state estimates for the medic. The patch is constructed using a patented process embedding integrated chips and electrical traces within soft, lightweight, stretchable, and breathable elastomer casing that matches the elasticity of skin."

SMALL-PPG is based on a novel integration of POCs physiological monitoring technology, miniaturized electronics and sensors, patient status algorithms, and wireless interface. Specifically, the innovation in electronics miniaturization, signal processing algorithms, and reflective PPG configuration enables the patch to measure and transmit a PPG waveform to an end-user device (EUD) for additional analysis and provide patient status remotely. Building on POCs previous successes in wearable electronics and physiological sensors, POC successfully researched, designed, and demonstrated a prototype in Phase I that can wirelessly transmit data to an EUD. The prototype generates a high-accuracy PPG waveform and derives physiological parameters in real time and is ready for initial testing in the Phase I Option. In Phase II, POC will develop a ruggedized SMALL-PPG prototype that can be demonstrated in a field environment with soldier medical attendants. Collaboration with military end-users will result in transition of the SMALL-PPG technology proof-of-concept evaluations in Phase III."

        "abstract": "Tactical Combat Casualty Care (TC3) is the difference between life and death following injury on the battlefield. First responders, combat medics, and casualty evacuation medics perform vital TC3 roles, but are often overburdened by multiple casualties and overwhelmed by an excess of sensor data that can be difficult to interpret in stressful and chaotic environments. Additionally, injuries can be difficult to identify when symptoms are not obvious and treatment can be difficult to perform, depending on the skill of the performer. To address these challenges, we propose to develop a prototype Ensemble Prediction for Intelligent Combat Casualty Care (EPIC3), a mobile application that uses an ensemble of classifiers, frequently tuned via machine learning, to predict life-threatening and difficult-to-detect injuries. EPIC3 presents the steps to treat those injuries through a simple, easy-to-use interface that tailors itself to the needs and skill level of the user."

        "abstract": "As populations continue to swell and migrate into urban areas, megacities have emerged that exert emergent complex issues. These cities that that support populations of greater than 10 million people have density and complexity that greatly surpasses what is typically found in LVCsimulations. A representation of megacities in simulation is clearly important to training, doctrine development, and analysis simulation communities to allow simulation of real world conditions in these unique environments. Fundamentally representation of megacities requires significant advances in simulation technology in many inter-related dimensions. These include high entity densities within the simulation, complex multi-level urban terrain representation and reasoning, critical infrastructure and patterns of life support, and lifecycle tool support.To address these complex requirements, StackFrame proposes to leverage its Phase I Research and its Blended Simulation Internal Research and Development (IR&amp;D) effort that already integrates dense urban terrain generated via StackFrames Magrathea terrain generation tool, with a Patterns of Lifesimulation with a next generation Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) based interoperability platform called Osseus. Together, these capabilities provide a Testbed that can easily be integrated with existing Army LVC simulations to research enhancements necessary tosupport a robust Megacity capability."

However, current preservation technology is aged, toxic and less effective than desired, hindering efforts to repair traumatic injury and chronic disease using new cell and tissue-based therapies. The proposed extracellular-like cryopreservation matrix technology (a cryomatrix) supports the critical preservation infrastructure needed to enable post-delivery assurance of therapy viability, function, and efficacy for precious biologics such as bone marrow.Phase I engineered first-of-its-kind biomimetic cryomatrices that are thermoresponsive and biocompatible to cryopreserve biologics. These non-toxic DMSO-, protein- and serum-free cryomatrices and the chemistry governing its high cell recovery performance after storage at -80C is made possible by bioinspired chemistry. A Phase II R&amp;D effort will advance chemical efforts to extend the capabilities of these cryomatrices and maximize their technological impact in biobanking.The primary goal is to establish this technology for long-term storage of critical blood and tissue biologics. Cryopreserved, transported, and thawed biologics will be transplanted into an immunocompromised murine model and assessed for engraftment at various time points."

When used for imaging, a SWIR camera can operate at night using light reflected off the subject in the scene, generating high resolution images with details such as shadows and surface roughness. Compared to thermal infrared imaging, SWIR images look more like visible images and thus scene interpretation is much easier. Even on moonless nights, natural background radiation from the sky, called nightglow, provides useful illumination for imaging. Additional advantages include imaging through glass windows, some types of camouflage, smokes, fires, and haze with less attenuation than visible light. Many objects of military interest, such as explosives and chemicals, disturbed earth, terrain, and vegetation, contain rich and unique spectral features in the SWIR band. The goal of this effort is to demonstrate high-performance extended short-wavelngth infrared photodetectors, focal plane arrays, and camera system based on Type-II superlattices. The photodetector performance goal is the following: quantum efficiency larger than 90% with anti-reflection coating, dark current density less than 710^-8 A\/cm2 at an operating temperature 200K or higher."

While the resin was designed specifically for filament winding applications, the technology could easily be transitioned to additional composite fabrication areas. Formulated resin systems were prepared to obtain the desired processing properties and high glass transition temperature. Combinations of multifunctional epoxy resin components and a toughener were found to deliver the required thermal and mechanical properties. Viscometry tests indicate that the resin system will provide a viscosity that falls within the optimal range required for filament winding of rocket motor casings. In addition, real-time cure dynamics tests demonstrated cure rates that will permit seamless integration into the production environment. The Phase II team will continue development of the composite matrix resin materials and processes that were demonstrated during Phase I. The overall objective of the Phase II research effort will be the transition of the developed resins system to a production environment. Pressure vessels and a representative composite rocket motorcase will be fabricated during Phase II."

Numerical modeling predicts that order of magnitude increases over current performance levels are possible if high aspect-ratio, highly conductive particles can be effectively disseminated as an un-agglomerated aerosol cloud.Experimental efforts in a Phase I feasibility demonstration affirm the prospects for achieving the benefits of tailored geometry and enhanced conductivity of graphite nanofibers for this purpose.In the Phase II development program, methods and findings from Phase I will be used to optimize size selection of CNF, and the equipment and instrumentation necessary to advance laboratory-scale production to bench-scale production will be designed and\/or qualified, and procured.The critical processing parameters will be optimized to yield reproducible advanced obscurants for broadband visible-IR obscuration.Phase II development will encompass enhanced milling processing, methods of selective filtration and sorting of particle size, conductivity enhancement by heat-treatment and intercalation, and functionalization to promote dispersibility.At the conclusion of the development effort, a cost model will be prepared for the selected processing steps, and samples will be provided to ERDC."

The augmented reality metrics and test methodology, test imagery, and software developed along with proof-of-principle testing conducted in Phase I provide a foundation for the research and developed to be conducted in the Phase II effort. The Phase II effort will result in a software and hardware design and development of Simulation for Perception Experimentation using Augmented Reality (SPEAR). The prototype SPEAR and test methods developed will provide a capability to assess the use of augmented reality in providing enhanced, real-world experimentation and training to Soldiers using new EO\/IR sensor modalities. The Phase II simulation advancements include increasing the experimentation difficulty, varying the conditions in which metrics are collected, and establishing a repeatable experiment for use in a perception testing laboratory. Our goal for the proposed effort is to develop and demonstrate a prototype simulator that integrates hardware and software to allow simulation for perception experimentation using augmented reality."

        "abstract": "The threat posed by Chemical Warfare Agents remains one of the key concerns in the defense against catastrophic attacks, underscoring the need to have equipment which prevents exposure to Chem\/Bio (CB) agents. Conventional fastening options for such equipment generally consist of zippers, hook and loop closures, or zip-track systems, all of which have drawbacks that make them susceptible to permeation of CB agents, especially for systems such as shelters and human remains pouches. Using technology inspired by the adhesive foot-hairs found on geckos, nanoGriptech has developed microstructured closure systems which provide a robust hermetic seal, even while subjected to large pressures gradients. These closure systems incorporate areas of continuous elastomeric interfaces with interlocking microfiber\/microridge adhesive arrays that mimic the micro\/nano-fibrillar structures on the feet of geckos, providing a hermetic seal that is resistant to CB agents. During this SBIR Phase II project, these closure systems will be optimized for strength and durability, fully tested, and scaled up into full-scale Army shelter and human remains pouch prototype systems. Successful execution of the proposed research tasks will result in a technology which can be produced at volume and is ready for integration into commercial acquisition programs."

To meet the need of providing realistic training during force-on-force training activities, Design Interactive has developed the prototype MedAR, a modular medical augmented reality (AR) training platform. Under the proposed phase II effort, MedAR will be expanded and enhanced to include the enhancement of existing scenarios, expansion of additional scenarios, an approach for adaptive training, the addition of an injury state module and after action review module, and integration of a physiology model.The full system design will be conceptualized, designed, and developed, followed by a training effectiveness evaluation (TEE).The resulting system will improve the realism of patient state representations during training exercises, and increase the fidelity and effectiveness of training compared to current virtual patient simulations and role player best practices."

An understanding of the perception errors imparted from the AR system is necessary to determine if the system can afford training. To meet this challenge, the development of TARgET, a Testbed for AR Experimentation and Training, is proposed. TARgET is an analysis tool that incorporates predictive and experimental methodologies that evaluate the applicability of AR technologies for use with EO\/IR sensor target acquisition training and experimentation. The experiments comprised in TARgET include psychophysical metrics and an automated experimental design methodology for ensuring content and construct validity before then assessing training efficacy. The TARgET testbed is comprised of three modules: Predictive Assessment Module, Human Visual Perception Validation Module, and the Training Efficacy Evaluation Module. The software tool will store a database of specifications for different AR technologies and relevant human performance and psychophysical tests. A methodology for completing the user-centered experiments is provided, along with data analysis and interpretation. Results are stored and can be searched for best-in-class hardware and software combinations. Additionally, cross comparisons between training approaches using AR and non-AR strategies are possible."

Our approach to achieve large area diamond wafers is to tile single crystal diamond substrates with close crystallographic alignment and then to deposit a high quality homoepitaxial diamond layer on topthe mosaic approach. The goals of the Phase II program are to generate diamond wafers that are greater than 6 cm^2 in area, and to develop a high fidelity manufacturing process that is capable of producing wafers of progressive larger sizes. The mosaic wafers will be composed of the highest grade diamond substrates available on the market, and will be fabricated using state of the art equipment, and state of the art microwave plasma-assisted chemical vapor deposition and diamond substrate stitching processes."

Spectrally and aperture selective metamaterial absorption suppresses blackbody radiation and enables the room temperature pyroelectric sensor to emulate the intrinsic noise rejection of cooled semiconductor band-gap devices. An array of thin pyroelectric metamaterial absorber elements tuned to different wavelengths are formed to produce a highly compact and high speed long wave infrared (LWIR) spectrometer for mobile passive stand-off chemical sensing. In prior Phase I and Phase II STTR efforts, SRICO proved the pyroelectric metamaterial sensor concept by demonstrating single and arrayed element narrowband MMPA pyroelectric elements. In this subsequent Phase II, arrayed MMPA sensor elements will be optimized for detection of specific analytes. Digital electronics and a software user interface will be developed to implement stand-alone chemical sensor modules. Compact, low cost and spectrally resolved stand-off chemical sensor modules that operate at room temperature will have broad applicability to a large number of important defense, industrial, medical, and environmental applications."

This allows eyes-free and silent operation without generating light. This proposal deals with two surface haptic display technologies. Variable-friction displays create haptic effects by varying the coefficient of friction between the fingertip and a surface through the control of localized electric fields. Active forcing displays provide a lateral force on the finger by coordinating friction control with in-plane motion of the surface.In Phase I we incorporated a variable-friction display into a COTS tablet and demonstrated the capability to recognize slope, altitude, and terrain of a location, to receive navigation directions, and to recognize situational dangers along a path through touch. For Phase II we propose to build a ruggedized and fully integrated two-in-one variable-friction tablet with an attachable keyboard and trackpad. The trackpad contains an active forcing haptic display, enhancing the device with the capability to display shape and to guide the finger along a path. The previously demonstrated capabilities will be integrated into a multi-functional software application that can load and display standard geospatial datasets."

        "abstract": "There have been many recent developments in the direct energy weapon space throughout the armed services, including the demonstration of the Navys Laser Weapons System (LaWS), the Armys High Energy Laser Mobile Test Truck (HELMTT) and Mobile Expeditionary High Energy Laser (MEHEL) amongst others. Many of these systems (ex. LaWS) are based on a number of smaller fiber lasers spatially combined to produce higher output powers of 1050 kW. The main drawback of these fiber lasers are low efficiency (20-30 percent), and poor beam quality due to the spatial combination. Forward Photonics proprietary wavelength beam combining technology (WBC) effectively solves this problem, by allowing for the combination of many distinct diode elements with a common output beam that has nearly the same beam characteristics as that of a single element. In Phase II of this program Forward Photonics will provide a laser subsystem that meets the requirements of a directed energy laser."

RTS, S\/AS01, the most advanced subunit vaccine, has undergone phase III clinical trials. However, their efficacy results are relatively low (30% to 50%). Due to the subunit protein weak immunogenicity, often necessitate advanced delivery vectors or adjuvants. Recent progress in the design of synthetic nanoparticles that can stimulate immune system opened up a new area of vaccine development, however with limited successes in malaria vaccine preventing these candidates going into clinical trials. These approaches failed to overcome the inherent drawbacks of subunit vaccines as well as failed to address the unique and complex ability to infect hosts at multistage of its life cycle with varying antigens present at the parasite particle surface. Luna proposes a novel nano enabled malaria vaccine which will induce long-lived protective immune responses by targeting multiple epitopes at each of its unique life stages through precisely engineered, releases of antigens and\/or adjuvants."

This will represent a major leap in available substrate area, from less than 1 cm2 available today. The technical path will directly follow the work begun in the Phase I program, which is, using our toroidal plasma CVD diamond deposition reactor,start with a single crystal seed and grow a large bulk piece of material through growth in one direction first and then growth in a 90-degree direction subsequently. The finished piece of bulk material can then be laser trimmed and polished and used as a master seed to grow thin wafers with about 1 day of growth. Michigan State University (MSU), our university partner in this effort, will perform all post-bulk growth processing and analysis, including laser cutting, polishing, optical and electron microscopy, and characterization of free hole density, channel Hall mobility, thermal conductivity and surface roughness."

        "abstract": "Systems &amp; Processes Engineering Corporation (SPEC) is proposing a fast moving Phase II Expendable Active RF Technologies for Helicopters (EARTH) program to deliver a fully functional 1x2x8 active expendable RF countermeasures prototype flight unit, which is form\/fit compatible with the AN\/ALE-47 dispenser. The proposed countermeasures flight unit (microUAV) expendables are configured with multifunctional EW capabilities and perform as active decoys, false targets, or jammers to defeat modern threats. SPECs proposed active expendable flight units implement integrated, substrate level, heterogeneous technologies, advanced antenna topologies, and ultra-dense packaging to achieve an extraordinary combination of low SWaP, system effectiveness and aerodynamic specifications, including performance in high acceleration ejection and flight through rotor wash environments. This Phase II EARTH design advances SPECs field proven (TRL 9) ADEP embedded adaptive countermeasures technology to yield an ensemble of field programmable coherent and non-coherent dense spectrum EW techniques for sophisticated deception and jamming. The proposed EARTH architecture and IP blocks will be configured for multi-mission adaptability and ease of integration with RWRs and onboard EW management suites. The impact of this program is far reaching and includes the development of inexpensive, mass producible microEW technologies for universal airframe protection and for multi-mission EW payloads for small UAVs."

As UPRS is designed, implemented, and modified, the benchmark testing framework will be used to track performance on several variations of current generation computing hardware.Analysis of the results gathered from benchmark testing will be used to prescribe system configurations for users to deploy UPRS.

HgTe colloidal quantum dot (CQD) focal plane arrays (FPAs), as developed by our team, are MWIR photon detectors that demonstrate high performance and fast response, have the potential for uncooled operation, and are monolithically integrated with readout integrated circuits. To take full advantage of the optical and transport properties of the state-of-the-art CQDs, we propose to develop new processing and device architectures, with the goal of achieving the optimal performance of a high-resolution (1344 x 744 format) MWIR CQD FPA for integration with a low-cost and high-performance imaging system. The parameters for optimal absorption and transport will be determined through improvements in single element detector architectures, then transferred to the FPAs. Our team is uniquely positioned to take on the challenges associated with the development of a compact and low-cost MWIR CQD-based imaging system, having been the first to demonstrate MWIR CQD FPAs and possessing a track record of developing innovative low-cost infrared camera systems."

This family of virus causes a significant bioterrorism threat due to the high levelof mortality, rate of transmissibility and the lack of an approved vaccine or therapy directed against it. The goal of this proposal is to develop,optimize and scale-up a mammalian cell culture-based bioprocess for the rapid manufacture of an antibody-based immunotherapy againstSudan virus. During this project BioFactura will generate two clonal suspension-adapted cell lines with high levels of specific and volumetricproductivity (Qp &gt;30 pcd and 1 g\/L, respectively) using the StableFast Biomanufacturing Platform. The system uses a multiplex selectionstrategy coupled to an innovative means to facilitate high copy number thereby significantly increasing the level of productivity and reducingdevelopment timelines. A robotic automation system that enables a high-throughput screening combined with high-resolution imaging will beuse to rapidly isolate and document high-performance clones.

        "abstract": "Medical Ultra Sound (US) technology, and associated hardware, software, algorithms, and systems have seen great development over the last decade, and field portable US transducer and imaging systems are readily available. However, key shortcomings remain that limit their application: 1) Need for operator control of wand pose, 2) Need for human expert interpretation of resulting US images, 3) Large Size, Weight, and Power, and 4) Seamless integration of imaging and treating capabilities such asthe ability to deliver focused acoustic energy with the aim of modulating organ\/tissue function. Given the tremendous potential of US treatment to (non-invasively) modulate neuron and tissue behavior, provide detailed images and powerful diagnostic capabilities, a novel US imaging, diagnostic, and treatment system is needed to overcome these key shortcomings. To address this critical need, Intelligent Automation Inc. (IAI), along with its partners,proposes to develop CUAIT, a Conformal Ultrasonic Aperture for Imaging and Treatment. The key innovation is to combine novel Micro-machined Ultrasonic Transducer, (CMUT) arrays, advanced algorithms for image formation and measurement of tissue mechanical properties, temperature distribution, and motion, with IAIs expertise in system, software, and hardware development, and understanding of both ultrasound technology and transition of technology to the (DoD) market place."

        "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common clinical condition that affects close to 30 million Americans. To overcome patient non-compliance and discomfort associated with current OSA treatments, we have developed SONOSA, a wearable device that can remotely diagnose, monitor, and treat OSA using ultrasound alone. As a diagnostic device, SONOSA can eliminate the expensive, in-hospital equipment required for polysomnography. SONOSA can directly measure airway collapse and send data to physicians. Once diagnosed, SONOSA can also utilize ultrasound to stimulate the hypoglossal nerve, which leads to tongue repositioning and reopening of the airway in most OSA patients. The objectives of this proposal will include the design and fabrication of a prototype with parallel functions: (i) ultrasound imaging of airway collapse during OSA, (ii) ultrasound stimulation of the hypoglossal nerve. Phase I deliverables will include a market assessment and the following deliverables for each of the three independent device functions: (i) modeling and simulations of expected imaging and acoustic energy delivery capabilities including power, pressure, frequency, spatial and temporal resolution specifications; (ii) testing of modeled capabilities by the prototype in a phantom system; (iii) prototype performance metrics, and identification and plan to address deficiencies to be optimized in Phase II."

        "abstract": "Nanohmics Inc. in collaboration with Dr. Andrea Al propose to develop and experimentally demonstrate ultra-compact nonlinear-plasmonic all-optical switches and isolators that exploit sharp asymmetric plasmonic-resonances observed in sub-wavelength metasurfaces. Devices will be comprised of plasmonic gratings that couple light into Long Range Surface Plasmons (LRSPs). The gratings are engineered to have sharp asymmetric Fano-resonance. The grating structures will be embedded in a nonlinear medium with large third-order susceptibility. Through the Kerr effect, the intensity of the input light can be varied to tune the signal wavelength across the Fano-resonance, thereby sharply modulating the reflectance, akin to an all-optical switch. In an alternative embodiment, an optical isolator can be created by designing a structural asymmetry in the device such that light approaching the device terminals from opposite ends have starkly different transmission. The proposed devices will operate at telecommunication wavelengths, have a 5 micron-square footprint or smaller, have a 3-dB insertion loss or better, and require modest optical power in the tens of MW\/cm^2 to operate. All-optical switches will aim to achieve at least 10-dB contrast between the on and off states and switching speeds better than 1 ns. Isolators will have at least 10-dB isolation between forward and reverse-propagating waves."

        "abstract": "Over a decade ago, security practitioners highlighted threats posed by memory corruption exploits subverting systems through manipulation of security-critical non-control-datawithout ever corrupting application control-flow. Since that demonstration, however, the full power of data-oriented attacks went largely unnoticed until very recently. One reason for this recent emergence is that exploitation of critical software (e.g., browsers, document-viewers, webservers) is getting harder due to widespread deployment of mitigations such as Data-Execution Prevention (DEP), Address-Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) and Control-Flow Integrity (CFI). Exploitation in face of DEP forces adversaries to rely on finding clever ways to chain together small instruction snippets (gadgets) to implement malicious logic, while bypassing ASLR requires disclosure of memory to identify those gadgets. With the deployment of CFI (e.g., CFGuard) in modern systems, however, sequencing gadgets is increasingly difficult. Not surprisingly, attacks simply evolved to instead make better use of memory disclosures (and modifications) by leaking security-sensitive data (e.g. HeartBleed) or modifying security-critical data (e.g., disabling DEP or browser same-origin policies). This trend will only get worse if strong protections are not put in place for guarding data in commodity closed-source software. We propose using recent advances in binary analysis to adapt source-based sandboxing to closed-source applications."

We propose Dobby, a tool that statically transforms software binaries to integrate run-time checks ensuring illicit data flows caused by memory corruption errors in the program cannot be used to compromise integrity and confidentiality of the programs data. To minimize the impact of dynamic checking on software runtime, the tool will apply protections heterogeneouslystronger, and thus more expensive, protections will be used to secure the data that is security-sensitive, while low-cost, coarse sandboxing will protect the rest of the data. Additionally, Dobby will detect and isolate private data contexts in data-rich applications (e.g., independent requests handled by a web server or pages visited by a web browser). Dobby will be able to protect COTS and legacy binaries, for which source code is typically not available. In case there is access to buildable source code, the tool will provide the capability for leveraging compile-time information for added accuracy and efficiency."

        "abstract": "Malicious modifications of hardware pose major concern in terms of reliable and trusted field operation of integrated circuits. To ensure security and trust of micro-chips, it is essential to develop efficient, low-cost techniques for detection of such tampering events. Conventional structural\/functional testing, coverage metrics, and test generation approaches cannot be readily applied to identify these malicious changes, also referred to as Hardware Trojan horses. This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop an automatic statistical test generation framework for combined functional and side-channel analysis based Trojan detection that provides very high confidence with respect to all possible Trojan forms and sizes. The effectiveness of the proposed test generation approach will be significantly enhanced by a low-cost, design-for-testability (DFT) approach that inserts test points at strategic design locations to significantly improve Trojan activation and observation probability. The tools for test generation and DFT can be seamlessly integrated with existing design flows for both application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC) as well as commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components. The project team has vast experience in hardware security and strong industry connections. The framework will be scalable to large industrial designs and will be evaluated with appropriate trust metrics."

        "abstract": "The Defense Advance Research Project Authority (DARPA) is seeking a capability to produce 500 Flying Missile Rails (FMRs) a month. Providing such a capability is challenging because one must simultaneously come up with a design for a FMR that meets mission requirements while being able to be mass produced. The North American Wave Engine Corporation (NAWEC) can provide a solution that will meet the governments requirements. NAWEC believes that one of the key barriers to the ability to mass produce FMRs is the expensive and complex propulsion systems that are likely to be attached to them. Jet turbine propulsion systems that are likely to be used in other designs contain numerous moving parts which makes mass-production difficult. NAWEC proposes using its proprietary pulsejet technology as the basis of an innovative FMR design to dramatically reduce manufacturing times of FMRs. NAWEC believes that reductions in manufacturing times derived from the ease of production for the powerplant will make a 500 unit a month production rate possible. NAWECs technology is able to meet these goals because our technology, a valveless pulsejet, contains no moving parts and is essentially a hollow tube."

The ACE-MRV is a high-performance expendable rocket stage that can either be launched (from the ground or air) as a single-stage to orbit (SSTO) launch vehicle to deliver small payloads to orbit or launched as an upper stage on a booster to deliver medium size payloads to orbit.This dual role is achieved using the exact same ACE-MRV stage with no hardware changes by simply retasking the on-board software to adjust the vehicle operation. The proposed Phase I effort will continue the development of the ACE-MRV design, including component sizing and selection, and a Preliminary Design Review.In the Phase II effort, the design will be completed and a prototype ACE-MRV stage will be fabricated and hot fire ground tested as an integrated stage."

        "abstract": "Numerous machine learning frameworks exist, each with highly variable support for accelerated computing (e.g. Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), etc). A library of machine learning primitives couldsupport the many disparate frameworks and boost the advancement of machine learning research and programs, such as those underway in the DARPA Data-Driven Discovery of Models (D3M) program. This proposal seeks to build accelerated machine learning primitives into the ArrayFire Machine Learning Library (ArrayFire-ML). Features of ArrayFire-ML include: 1) transparent hardware acceleration due to ArrayFires ability to run on CUDA parallel computing platforms, within the Open Computing Language (OpenCL) framework, or on multi-core Central Processing Unit (CPU) devices, 2) support for many programming languages, including Python and Julia, via community language wrappers, 3) the robust and already deployed ArrayFire testing and documentation framework, 4) the active and broad existing ArrayFire open source community seeking additional machine learning functionality, and 5) with the proposed D3M primitives in ArrayFire-ML, all of ArrayFires existing math functions would become available for further research efforts on those primitives. In this proposal, we seek to provide a significant leap forward to the machine learning field by building a robust, open source library of accelerated machine learning primitives available to frameworks, the D3M program, and the broader research community."

Humans tend to explain concepts with symbolic narratives, which contrasts the way non-symbolic machine learning represents concepts. This research addresses this challenge by grounding the research in the problem of helping transitioning veterans find relevant careers. The developed prototype will provide job recommendations emerging from a Long Short-Term Memory trained on word embeddings derived from 1.73 million job descriptions and 70,000 resumes. Explanations of matches are grounded in selected text segments, or StoryGraph elements, from an individuals resume with a skill decomposition graph providing additional clarification. By grounding the explanation, veterans will be able to understand causal relationships between resumes and job descriptions. The proposed second phase will investigate conceptual explanation through hierarchical learning and the potential for attention-based neural networks to improve the matching and semantic explanations. We will also extend the StoryGraph to provide insights into career path trajectories and create an interactive interface for veterans to gain deeper insights and explore hypotheticals. We propose an option task to explore generalizability by extending it to the medical domain to help match doctors and patients."

        "abstract": "Voice phishing (&quot;vishing&quot;) is an increasingly serious threat that cost victims over $46 billion in 2016. Attackers pose as trusted callers using impersonation, voice mimicry, speech synthesis, voice conversion, Caller ID spoofing, and other techniques. Once victims trust the caller, the perpetrator can engage in fraudulent and criminal activities leading to financial losses and security breaches. The proposed research will result in a Real-time Enhanced Voice Authentication (REVA) system that detects many common forms of vishing, is available as a SaaS solution and mobile app, and serves to verify known callers in real-time. REVA builds on and extends techniques used in automated interactive voice response systems and audio forensics to detect signal alterations and to verify known speakers. REVA will monitor voice streams in real time and use a machine learning algorithm to continually estimate the likelihood that vishing is taking place, alerting users to dangers before they reveal sensitive information. This capability will be of great value to the security and defense communities, call centers, businesses, and consumers. The proposed architecture and machine learning approach give REVA the ability to learn to detect new types of attacks and to be updated as network characteristics and communication technologies evolve."

        "abstract": "The proposed project seeks to develop an end-to-end data driven system to estimate the effects of historical and forecast the effects of future deterrent courses of action (COAs) against Gray Zone challengers. US conventional military power regularly deters adversaries from employing large-scale conventional forces against US interests; however, this success often motivates adversaries to pursue Gray Zone strategies short of conventional war to achieve their political objectives. The proposed system integrates multi-disciplinary theories and multi-perspective data to understand and forecast the direct and indirect effects of US whole of government deterrent tactics and strategies to deter Gray Zone aggressors. Specifically, the project will assess the causal impacts of US COAs. The system will employ adaptive ensemble models to forecast the effects of COAs in current and future Gray Zone contexts. The project will combine advanced algorithms and empirically driven methodologies with social science theories and expertise to measure and generate influence to successfully deter Gray Zone challengers. The project will assess the range of Gray Zone threats to better understand and adapt to the Gray Zone landscape."

        "abstract": "Decision making and development of potential courses of action at militarily strategic levels presents challenges due to sociocultural factors, conflicting goals, and an often complex web of relationships among international actors. However, current computational tools may not anticipate and account for deception and recognize when planned actions may appear to contradict a desired message. For this reason, we propose to create a decision aid for Prediction and Recognition of Intent, Decision, and Emotion (PRIDE) that will model and reason about the observations, beliefs, and goals of actors to help understand and predict their reactions. PRIDE will develop tools incorporating four related capabilities: (1) assessment of other actors likely attitudes, beliefs, and goals; (2) estimation of possible actions and reactions of other actors; (3) evaluation of international courses of action; and (4) suggestion of revised international courses of action. We will develop novel higher-order representations of beliefs and goals to support theory-of-mind reasoning, intent recognition, and cognitive appraisal simulation. PRIDE will improve decision making in multi-party strategic scenarios by providing alternative perspectives on complex situations."

These CFPs will have a surface profile that has targeted conformability around obstacles that results in an improved acoustic seal around eyeglasses from the military Approved Protective Eyewear List (APEL) and improves the attenuation over the stock ear seal for three commonly used military communication headsets\/helmets (the Gentex HGU-56\/P Helmet, MSA-Sordin Supreme Pro-X Ear Muff, and David Clark Model H10-13.4 Aviation Headset). These CFPs will be based off currently existing Comply foam technology from Hearing Components that has shown an increase in attenuation over stock Gentex and MSA ear seals, especially in the low frequency. This will serve as a solid platform for further work toward this objective. In addition, our pilot scale production equipment, in-house foam formulation and acoustic testing resources will allow rapid development of functional prototypes."

The crystalloid based resuscitation fluid in development by GanD Inc. has been designed to address all of the shortcomings of the currently available solutions.The solution, GND-001, is a crystalloid with a decreased chloride concentration to reduce hyperchloremic acidosis and buffered with acetate, which can be utilized as a Kreb cycle intermediate.The overall concept is to replace metabolic components consumed in response to trauma and hemorrhage.These components including amino acids, Kreb cycle intermediates, and micronutrients have been identified using metabolomic profiling of trauma patients.We have also include specific vitamins as the literature has shown that certain vitamins have potent anti-inflammatory effects, such as Vitamin E derivatives that have been investigated in acute radiation sickness.Additionally, the GND-001 will be calcium free to allow the co-administration of blood products with the fluid. We believe that GND-001 will improve outcomes following severe hemorrhage by replacing lost components and aid in the recovery at the cellular level."

Our first task is to identify suitable materials and analyze the LR products to make sure that they meet USP standards. We will then design and test and deliver a prototype and associated laboratory test results to DHA.We will also do an engineering analysis to estimate the weight, volume and cost of the units. In Phase II, we will design, fabricate and scale-up production for delivery of a minimum of ten (10) preproduction prototypes for joint military utility assessment and independent lab verification."

Additionally, with over 85% reduction in volume, critical storage space can be significantly less. Fosmo Med has currently worked on 0.9% saline solution for the disaster relief market and is ready for the FDA phase. This Phase I project will include development of a prototype based on our saline solution bag design and materials while demonstrating the efficient reconstitution of FMLRS meets the FDAs standards for administration. The primary commercial market for the FMLRS would be for disaster relief efforts, where the last mile problem of delivering this critical life-saving product is problematic with the current solution. This technology can be used to create not only saline and FMLRS, but other solutions can be created at the spot of care so lives can be saved."

The availability of front line medical personnel, safe spaces to administer care, medical supplies, and time may be degraded because of enemy activity or lack of resources, denying physical access to evacuate patients and deliver medical treatment. The DoD does not yet have a training program or system that sufficiently addresses the unique challenges of preparing medical providers to deliver care in CDO environments, including prolonged field care and en route care. To meet these needs, we propose to design and demonstrate the feasibility of Extensible Field and Evacuation Care Training in a Virtual Environment (EFECTIVE). EFECTIVE is a screen-based simulator for training, practicing, and assessing the skills for providing point of injury and en route care in CDO environments. EFECTIVE can be deployed to desktop computers and tablets and presents virtual patients and an interactive toolkit that trainees can use to perform interventions and diagnostics. Additionally, EFECTIVE interfaces with a variety of external systems and allows instructors to create new content and training material."

        "abstract": "A joint can exit its socket when it is exposed to an unhealthy level of force or rotation, causing a large amount of pain and loss of functionality in the limb. Joint dislocation can easily be diagnosed by a physical examination: palpitation of the affected joint will usually cause pain and tenderness in the patient, and the dislocated head of the bone can be felt out of its usual position in the joint. When a dislocation occurs, a closed reduction can return the joint to its normal position, preventing damage to the ligaments, tendons, or neurovascular structures associated with the joint.While the injury is common and diagnosis is simple, hands-on training is neither common nor practical given current physical training models, which consists of descriptions\/outlines for the different techniques, provided during a lecture or while watching an experienced clinician perform a technique. SIMETRIs solution to this gap is conceived as the Joint Articulation And Reduction Simulator (JAARS), which addresses a market need for a high-fidelity simulator that enables students and practitioners with a risk-free, repeatable, inexpensive training opportunity. JAARS integrates with existing commercial manikins, presents multiple dislocation scenarios, uses embedded sensors to provide feedback, and employs a modular design."

The first true reduction performed by medical providers is on actual patients. This method of instruction prevents the trainee from developing the comfort and necessary cognitive and psychomotor skills associated with the reduction. Luna Innovations and its partners at the University of Virginia Center for Applied Biomechanics propose development of a low-cost joint reduction task trainer that will enable more effective training for both military and civilian care givers. This technology will be known as the JoRT platform and will provide realistic anatomy and reduction forces while being fabricated with low-cost materials and production techniques; resulting in realistic, but affordable, training. Lunas experience in developing low cost medical simulation products will allow them to leverage current distribution relationships to ensure this much needed training system reaches the market as soon as possible. Our investigation into the feasibility of a JoRT platform will result in a low-cost, easy to use product that is easily integrated into current training regimes."

        "abstract": "Complex extremity injuries involving peripheral nerves are a significant issue for combat military personnel. Current clinical methods for repairing peripheral nerve injuries, including microsutures, autologous nerve autografts, and synthetic or autologous conduits, have limited success in fully restoring functional behaviors. Since these methods rely on the slow process of the axonal outgrowths from the proximal stumps, the denervated muscles distal to the injury site lose the capacity to reinnervate. Triton Systems, Inc. proposes to further develop its technology for peripheral nerve repair that preserves the target muscle and promotes the effective functional recovery. The proposed technology is also designed to standardize peripheral nerve surgical repair procedures and offer a more consistent repair technique that will lead to improved clinical outcomes."

Further this platform does not rely on any autologous tissue and is amenable to scalable manufacturing methods. The basis of this platform is a targeted delivery technology that permits site-specific osteo-chondral induction within injury sites. The biologic carrier platform is able to deliver multiple osteoinductive and chondro-inductive biologics in a spatially controlled way that permits cartilage repair that is distal to bone repair. This allows the surgeon to mold the implant to any geometry and to control where bone and cartilage repair occur in a seamless manner that mimics natural articular cartilage integration into supporting bone."

        "abstract": "To address the need for a novel self-propelled tick collection device that is capable of operating in diverse habitats under various environmental conditions, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) has designed and built a new Multifunctional Automated Tick-Collection Rover (MATR) prototype that can be automated or remotely operated to deploy compartment traps and drag flags to collect non-questing and questing ticks, respectively. In Phase I, POC developed the initial MATR concept design and built a reduced-functional prototype. This prototype includes the MATR all-terrain vehicle platform, a flag cassette, numerous pitfall traps, and the controller software for mission planning. The prototype successfully self-navigated through a predefined course, and deployed flags for continuous sampling. It can remain stationary for point sampling, use 2.2-kg of dry ice to produce &gt;8-hr of CO2, operate continuously for &gt;1-hr, and weighs approximately 44-lb. The Phase I development has led to a MATR design that will be further improved in Phase II and built into a fully functional rugged prototype weighing approximately 30-lb for effective autonomous tick surveillance. The fabricated prototype will be tested in both laboratory and field environments for efficacy in collecting medically important ticks such as Dermacentor variabilis and Rhipicephalus sanguineus, Ixodes scapularis, and Dermacentor marginatus."

        "abstract": "Traditionally, prosthetic legs are built by a prosthetist and then properly aligned while the patient is wearing the device. This process is iterative and time consuming for the patient and prosthetist, and still often leads to improper or non-optimal prosthesis alignment.Without a properly aligned prosthesis, one is unable to maximize performance outcomes and return a person to their former activity level which is needed to maintain physical fitness. Prosthetic performance depends critically on alignment; that is, the alignment of prosthetic components governs how loads are transferred to and from the residual limb, which directly affects how the user is supported and able to interact with the external world. FTL Labs Corporation&apos;s (FTL&apos;s) &quot;Sensorized Prosthetic Alignment Read-Out (SPARO)&quot;, is a technology that will allow all prosthetists and medical providers to easily and inexpensively align prosthetic components to maximize function for the person with repeatable results. SPARO has been developed as a collaboration between product engineers, academic researchers in the field of assistive technologies, and prosthetists working in clinics around the country. Immediate feedback is presented to the prosthetist through a custom software GUI, providing load transfer and kinematics data between the residual limb and external environment with innovative analytics."

The DLA has identified critical ALRA NSNs that are sourced by fewer than two manufacturers, limiting availability and competition. NextGen is a proven designer\/manufacturer of high-complexity parts, systems, and prototype vehicles to the DoD and major defense contractors. NextGen has reviewed the DLA solicitation and identified six NSNs that are well suited to its manufacturing capabilities. NextGen will develop a manufacturing and inspection plan for each NSN. Where required, partnerships with suppliers will be created to complete manufacturing tasks NextGen is not currently suited. The completed manufacturing plan will be submitted as a SAR for each NSN to the DLA. It is not expected sample parts will be manufactured during phase I. NextGen will use the phase I effort to examine and determine the best path towards a quality management certification such as ISO 9001. This is a required certification to allow NextGen to compete for DLA manufacturing contracts. Through these steps NextGen hopes to become a Source Approved supplier to the DLA, increasing competition, DLA suppliers, and expanding NextGens manufacturing services."

        "abstract": "DLA Subsistence Supply Chain (SSC) experiences mold growth on wood pallets used for transportation of MRE. We propose a mold growth analysis and mitigation methodology based on supply chain, microbial monitoring and statistical techniques. The supply chain is modeled as a network of storage, production nodes and transportation links. A data collection procedure is developed to gather data related to mold growth factors at each point in the supply chain. Statistical and data mining techniques identify the root cause of mold development. An optimization model is developed to identify the subset of solutions which maximize cost-benefit in the mold mitigation process. A feasibility study is proposed in Phase I. It will show that the supply chain methodology can identify critical factors for mold development in a single route of the SSC. Conceptual design of the methodology will be completed in this phase. The feasibility study will be followed by Phase II, in which the methodology will be validated for multiple routes of the SSC. The proposed work sets the foundation for wide implementation of supply chain-based mold mitigation strategies. The potential market of this work includes a majority of supply chains given the prevalence of wood pallet usage."

These supplies are no longer readily available and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) has need for an alternate supplier that can qualify as a new approved source for the Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) activities.A replacement supplier will need to create a Technical Data Package (TDP) for this part.With 20 years of experience in the power electronics industry, QorTek is fully cognizant of the issues with sourcing components and maintaining parts supply along with challenges of parts obsolescence, non-equivalent parts replacement, and the problem of counterfeit or recycled part reliability. During Phase I QorTek will complete a total reverse engineering process of the presently used power supply and complete the design of a form-fit-function equivalent power supply by completing the TDP this will include a detailed manufacture and supply plan that will assure DLA of QorTeks ability to be a qualified approved source and provide long-term parts supply."

The challenge in taking full advantage of this architecture is selecting which data structures will be placed in the high-bandwidth memory. Optimizing data structure placement in memory is a task that requires the assistance of automated tools. To address this need, ATC-NY will develop the Memory Instrumentation and Performance Simulation (MIPS) software, a memory analysis and optimization tool aimed at next-generation HPC memory architectures. MIPS directly instruments as-built optimized binaries, without requiring source code or modification of the software build process, models the behavior of the complete memory hierarchy of a system, and uses this analysis to produce intelligent, actionable advice on memory placement. MIPS also provides the cutting-edge capability to apply memory placement optimization without requiring source code changes, enabling a single software executable to be used on differently-configured systems and for different use cases without requiring software re-engineering and without giving up any potential performance."

        "abstract": "DTRA uses High Fidelity Computer Codes (HFCC) to investigate weapon effects and techniques for countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD). End-to-end HFCC simulations in support of the DTRA Agent Defeat Warfighter Capability will require calculations including multiple phenomena that occur in vastly different time scales (-sec to hours). As DTRA becomes increasingly reliant on computational modeling and simulation for these security-critical tasks, efficient use of existing computational resources and planning and optimizing for next generation architectures becomes paramount. HFCCs typically are memory-bound codes and much CPU time is wasted waiting for the data needed to perform a computation. Emerging innovations in memory technology that mitigate memory performance issues, therefore, come at a critical time and optimizing HFCCs for pre-exascale systems that feature such technologies must start now. To enable such optimizations, this project proposes to build the MemInsight tool for analyzing application memory address streams of HFCCs to identify access patterns, the extent to which different levels of memory are exploited, memory footprint, and key data structures. The resultant data forms the basis for issuing guidance for HFCC refactoring and optimization."

This new simulator design will be the latest addition to our family of Configurable Link Test Sets (CoLTS). It will be capable of emulating the full range of MIL-STD-3053 scintillating channel conditions for all SATCOM frequency bands up to Ka-band. CoLTSAD will support developmental and acceptance testing of existing communication systems designs using separate analog interface units, and future communication systems compliant with the new FAST OSDI (ANSI\/TIA-5041) industry standard for digital-IF modems without analog IF front ends.The CoLTS-AD will be low-cost to build, and low-cost to certify: 1) it will be built on an inexpensive COTS hardware platform; and 2) will include built-in test functions that allow comprehensive certification testing procedures to be executed and tabulated automatically. Automated certification test execution and report generation can be performed after each simulator update or repair, simplifying configuration management and reducing life cycle costs."

        "abstract": "Echo Ridge proposes to deliver a Hardware-in-the-Loop RF environment emulator with high fidelity scintillation simulation within which propagation models will in real-time accurately simulate a nuclear-disturbed environment for testing MILSATCOM communications links. The emulator will accommodate the attachment of physical devices (MILSATCOM communications link equipment or simulators), and\/or models of such devices (software-based virtual spectrum users), and will permit users to establish paths through the emulated RF environment to connect the physical and\/or virtual MILSATCOM devices. The communications paths will be subject to the effects of the emulated RF environment(s), including the nuclear-disturbed ionization effects, and users will be able to observe and measure the impact of these effects. The simulator will be based on the existing and proven Echo Ridge DYnamic RF Environment Emulator (DYSE), and will incorporate multiple state-of-the-art, user-selectable ionospheric propagation channel models. DYSE is a scalable HiTL RF environment emulator which supports up to 24 x 24 individually tunable transmit to receive paths with each path capable of support 100 MHz of instantaneous bandwidth. The channel modeling provides an established baseline capability for high scattering severity cases, and arbitrary scattering severity, inhomogeneous environments\/non-stationary channels, and long duration."

        "abstract": "During Phase I and a first Phase II, Welkin Sciences developed the Channel Realization Generator (CReG) algorithm, an enhanced functional replacement for the ACIRF code intended to be embedded into software link simulations and HWIL fading channel simulators. The proposed second Phase II effort will refine the CReG documentation and its software and firmware implementations. Many in the strategic communications test community have already recognized the significance and benefits of the CReG algorithm, as evidenced by the five strong support letters included in the proposal. In a higher sense, DTRAs modeling, analysis and test tools constitute the vehicle through which DTRA&apos;s decades of research in high-altitude phenomenology and RF propagation are delivered to scientists, contractors and testers. CReG represents a continuation of DTRAs long history of providing the strategic communications community with the tools they need to develop and test scintillation-hardened communications systems."

        "abstract": "We introduce a concept and a design for a high-speed, high-temperature infrared scene projector for midwave (MWIR) and longwave infrared (LWIR) application. Results from study of carbon nanotube (CNT) material characteristics, along with field emission and electro-thermal modeling show that higheffective MWIR temperatures can be sustained and projected by a CNT pixel with little or no spillover to adjacent pixels. The proposed projector utilizes groups of selectively grown nanotube arrays to construct the projector pixel. Pure carbon nanotubes can sustain extreme temperaturesand emit as lambertian blackbodies. The nanotube thermal time constants are on the order of nanoseconds to picoseconds and since the nanotube array consists of individual isolated nanotubes or minimally connected (touching) nanotubes, the entire nanoforest will exhibit the same ultra-fast response. The projected image will be continuous in time as with the microemitter arrays but will be able to project significantly higher temperature, high dynamic range scenes at frame rates. The projectors high frame rates, small pixel sizes, and blackbody emittance over the entire infrared region fully supports real-time testing of tactical sensorsand may provide considerable size and weight advantages.Approved for Public Release | 17-MDA-9219 (31 May 17)"

        "abstract": "Threaded fastening systems in vibrating environments require a secondary locking feature, augmenting primary locking provided by an applied preload, to prevent vibration-induced loosening. The secondary locking feature can be mechanical, prevailing torque-type, or an adhesive. Self-locking nutplates and inserts are often more expensive than adhesives, require retorquing or on-torque adjustments, and need extra space. Therefore, anaerobic adhesives such as Loctite can a better alternative, especially when access is limited. However, liquid locking compounds (LLCs) are very application process-sensitive, and many factors can affect the curing process. Triton Systems, Inc. proposes to further advance the process solution and the tool which had been developed in Phase I to apply accurate volumes of LLCs to various fastener systems reproducibly, enabling reliable performance of LLCs as a secondary locking feature. The process solution will specify cure time and the minimum amount of LLCs required to achieve optimum breakaway torque values. In conjunction, Triton will further improve the LLC dispensing tool for accuracy and repeatability of delivering small volumes.Approved for Public Release | 18-MDA-9522 (23 Feb 18)"

The current suite of plume modeling tools contains the basic framework for flowfield and signature generation, but lacks the underlying physical mechanisms and supporting property databases to properly account for alternate waveband regions. Recent efforts by Spectral Sciences, Inc. (SSI) used innovative computational chemistry techniques and laboratory data to generate a database of chemical rates among ro-vibrational state specific levels to extend the wavelength range of signature codes. The present approach develops and tests innovative procedures to compress the number of database states and rates, making routine applications possible. Phase I demonstrated the approach with simple single-cell \/ single species models and with full plume flowfield and signature calculations of field data using a detailed chemical kinetic mechanism. Phases II\/III will upgrade plume signature codes to include additional gas and condensed phase (particulate) signature mechanisms and radiation transport methods for creating signatures from output flowfields. A major task in Phase II will be validation against field data.Approved for Public Release | 18-MDA-9522 (23 Feb 18)"

After initial launch detection, there is a need to track all in-flight missiles which will entail different requirements for missile state estimates for location and classification depending upon the current trajectory phase (boost, ascent, midcourse, or terminal). We will accomplish this by automating the solution of the enterprise wide scheduling problem through the use of automated information needs generations and schedule optimization using a Lagrangian relaxation technique. This scheduling approach allows for the ability to dynamically re-task all of the C2BMC sensors based upon collected data.

        "abstract": "Missile Defense Agency (MDA) Model and Simulation (M&amp;S) capabilities include Core Truth models (CTM) capable of simulating all physics governing missile detection, tracking and intercept events. A key component of the simulation tools is an accurate and fast atmospheric radiation model to describe the target signals as they propagate through the atmosphere to the sensor. Ideally, such a model should be designed to be readily interfaced with existing scene generation tools, such as Joint Signature Image Generator (JSIG) or Fast Line-of-sight Imagery for Target and Exhaust-plume Signatures (FLITES) to create Vis\/IR scenes in real time. In Phase I, Spectral Sciences, Inc. (SSI) developed the Vis\/IR Atmospheric Tool (VISIRAT), a prototype and proof-of-principle fast-atmospheric effects module for computing lines-of-sight (LOS) radiances to create Vis\/IR scenes in real time. In Phase II, VISIRAT will be further upgraded for speed and accuracy, and modularized for modeling two important MDA environmental effects, Auroral events and Earthshine illumination. Modeling both of these effects are high priority requirements within the Common Environment Models (CEM) for E\/O as well as radar applications. In Phase III, we shall address other E\/O atmospheric effects required for the CEM, including Earthlimb, Skyshine, Cloudshine, Aerosols, etc.Approved for Public Release | 18-MDA-9522 (23 Feb 18)"

During Phase I effort, POC developed and demonstrated the feasibility of the LADIF concept, laying a strong foundation for future development. In Phase II, POC plans to make the next major increment in LADIF development by constructing a mature LADIF tool, performing comprehensive testing, verification, validation, and demonstration, and implementing the LADIF prototype as well as the design for associated tooling for the application of the locking liquid compounds (LLC). Upon completion of Phase II, the LADIF will be ready for a pilot program in collaboration with selected original equipment manufacturers on programs of interest to the government. The innovations in the mechanical design and automated process enable the operator to treat different fasteners (nuts, bolts, helicoils and inserts) and dispense LLCs uniformly along the threaded surface. As a result, LADIF offers accurate, consistent, and repeatable adhesive dispensing, achieving the required strength for installed fasteners, and meets the MDAs requirements.Approved for Public Release | 18-MDA-9522 (23 Feb 18)"

        "abstract": "Novel algorithms for improving the performance of IMU without changing the sensor hardware were demonstrated during the Phase I research. These improvements consisted of higher-order nonlinear transfer alignment and calibration filters incorporating detailed models of sensor uncertainties, de-noising algorithms to eliminate the impact of shock and vibration on the IMU navigation solution, and more accurate algorithms for propagating the navigation equations. Using MDA-supplied data, these signal processing algorithms were shown to substantially improve the IMU accuracy of tactical-grade IMU sensors based on metrics such as Circular Error Probable and fixed-interval root mean square navigation errors. Algorithms and software developed under the Phase I research can be used to improve the accuracy of sensor calibration, as well as for transfer alignment of the inertial navigation system during operations. The focus of the present proposed Phase II research is on developing a hardware-software prototype of the signal processing system and evaluating it under realistic operating conditions. Optimal Synthesis Inc is teaming with IMU sensor manufacturers for testing and qualifying the system for military and commercial markets.

        "abstract": "QuNav proposes to validate and prototype a TRansform-domain INS Mechanization and Algorithmic Correction (TRIMAC). TRIMAC utilizes joint time\/frequency domain processing of inertial sensor data in order to mitigate INS drift in the absence of external navaids (such as GPS). Frequency-domain implementation is particularly designed to improve the inertial performance in high-vibration missile environments. Particularly, dominant vibration modes are identified and utilized for the separation of angular errors (misorientation and gyro drifts) and translational motion errors (accelerometer biases) thus enabling a full-state observability. Frequency-domain solution of inertial differential equations mitigates conning and sculling errors that are associated with traditional time-domain algorithms.For risk reduction and to maximize the Governments return on investment, TRIMAC will leverage embedded prototyping capabilities developed by Northrop Grumman Mission Systems (NGMS). Transform-domain system mechanization of TRIMAC will be directly supported by existing NGMS signal processing tools (via the use of reconfigurable correlation engines and embedded software modules) and without the need of additional hardware resources. As a result, incorporation of TRIMAC into perspective NGMS navigation products will be performed as a software-based add-on thus minimizing the size, weight and power (SWaP) of the overall system.Approved for Public Release | 18-MDA-9522 (23 Feb 18)"

POC previously defined the system parameters and demonstrated a technology readiness level (TRL)-5 prototype on an industry-standard four-axis CNC to provide stir welding, proving technology repeatability and retrofitability. POC will enhance the ROBOBOND technology based on prior results and findings, mature the ROBOBOND tools and support systems, optimize the process parameters, and integrate the systems into a semi-automated prototype that can be retrofitted onto a commercially available CNC machine. Performance objectives such as weld seam strength, weld seam microstructure, and vessel integrity will be defined. POC will demonstrate the ROBOBOND process on an actual thin-walled aluminum tank shell produced by an aerospace manufacturer. POC will further develop the technology and determine how the technology can increase profitability, speed, and reliability in aerospace lean manufacturing environments. The next-generation ROBOBOND system will reach technology readiness level (TRL)-6 and be ready for initial testing for transition to customers.Approved for Public Release | 18-MDA-9522 (23 Feb 18)"

Most measuring devices include some electromechanical device, which has a time lag. In the case of IMU, the integration of measurements, which lag corresponding accelerations or gyroscopic rates, has a detrimental effect on estimated velocity, position and attitude.The proposed design consist in using an observer dynamical model representative of corresponding IMU sensor dynamics and a Higher Order Sliding Mode (HOSM) injector, feeding this observer with a signal referred as reconstructed input such that its output matches actual measured output. The reconstructed input has a lag several orders of magnitude smaller than the normal input. The proposed SBIR work is a re-visit of the autonomous calibration problem using Higher Order Sliding Mode (HOSM) control solutions. The HOSM approach allows the separation of complex Multiple-Input, Multiple-Output control problem into a set of simpler Single-Input, Single-Output control problems. This approach achieves faster convergence and settling times, and is robust to system and gyroscope noise.Approved for Public Release | 18-MDA-9522 (23 Feb 18)"

        "abstract": "Performing post-intercept assessment (PIA) is challenging due to the dual problems of first, extracting usable data in a highly cluttered and unpredictable post-intercept environment, and second, fusing that disparate data in a flexible and rapid way. Toyon and Modern Technology Solutions, Inc. (MTSI) propose a two-pronged approach to PIA dealing with the feature-finding and feature-fusion aspects of the problem and the way these two elements of the problem interact; models and simulations will be used that are anchored to flight data and where possible to pre-mission predictions. In the feature-finding regime, feature-finding algorithms based on fragmentation tracking will be further developed from Phase I work and used to extract features of interest in a highly cluttered post-intercept environment. The feature-finding results will be used to structure a Bayesian network for performing feature fusion for fusing different types of evidence. This network will take into account multiple questions of effectiveness. The performance of this Bayesian network will be quantified and bounded, with optimization of parameters of interest. These algorithms will be implemented in a way that allows both in-house testing and testing with the Collaborative Test and Evaluation Center (CTEC).Approved for Public Release | 18-MDA-9522 (23 Feb 18)"

In contrast, radar atmospheric effects models whose behavior is derived from globally consistent environment models and modern data sets can evaluate the probability of occurrence of adverse radar sensor effects enabling formal risk assessment and actionable results from environment modeling of the missile defense system. We propose developing a system of radar environment effects modules that anchor their behavior to global environment models such as the Standardized Atmosphere Generator (SAG), the International Reference Ionosphere (IRI), and the International Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF). In addition, probability of occurrence distributions will be developed from modern databases of environment observations such as GPS scintillation and TEC data. For ionospheric radar effects we will address scintillation, range delay, auroral clutter, and Faraday rotation\/absorption. Current scintillation models in propmod rely on conventional solar and geomagnetic observables such as sunspot number and planetary K index, Kp. We plan to use results from our analysis of an extensive set.Approved for Public Release | 18-MDA-9522 (23 Feb 18)"

STILMAN proposes to conduct novel research to develop a highly automated and composable scenario generation toolset. Currently, in the distributed system of systems Operational Testing enterprise, high impact opportunities exist to apply scenario composition tools, develop a common data repository, and to replace numerous manual processes with automated, machine readable data exchanges between test participants. By integrating STILMANs unique Linguistic Geometry (LG) based technology with a shared data repository, a lightweight front end scenario generation toolset can be developed to increase automation within the test process.Initial research will focus on automated scenario composition and the early simulation of key test conditions to decrease test preparation timelines and enable the test stakeholders to confirm that the analysis goals, system performance models, criteria data, data repositories and inter-system messaging are sufficient to achieve the desired test fidelity. Numerous commercial testing enterprises in the automotive, aviation, and robotics industries could benefit from this design approach and the test tool framework.Approved for Public Release | 18-MDA-9522 (23 Feb 18)"

        "abstract": "Measuring and characterizing the post-intercept states of a missile intercept event is critical for determination of interceptor effectiveness. System sensors including radar imaging infrared (IR), ultraviolet (UV), and visible wavelength sensors have been used to characterize these events. FreEnt has developed an innovative approach to post-intercept assessment based on mathematical formalisms successfully employed in particle physics. This approach treats the intercept event as one would treat a particle scattering event in a particle accelerator or collider experiment. The initial states of the target and the interceptor are defined by the kinematics of the hit-conditions and the final states are statistical. These are typically determined from radar tracking data and IR and visible spectra, and imaging data which may identify a particular booster type and hence a set of possible target payloads. The method assumes space-based, ground-based, and airborne sensors are capable of measuring specific state variables which determine the intercept conditions. State-vectors are then defined for the initial and final states of the system from which the SVDF quantity can be computed. This quantity is then shown to be proportional to the probability the final state of the system and target is consistent with the target being defeated.Approved for Public Release | 18-MDA-9522 (23 Feb 18)"

        "abstract": "Under Phase-I of MDA SBIR 16.3-021, i3 demonstrated a new time-efficient technique, the i3 Transient Decomposition Method (TDM), for generating statistically-based material response models that predict the decomposition process that thermal protection system materials undergo when exposed to severe aerothermal heating environments. The i3 TDM is an enabling technology for MDA and other agencies that will drastically increase reliability of vehicle design by improving flight realism while reducing required cost and schedule. i3 TDM integrates the use of novel T&amp;E methodologies and facilities coupled to new modeling and simulation approaches. The resulting combination of novel testing and M&amp;S enables development of high fidelity thermochemical decomposition models to support transient aerothermal analysis and system design. This process emphasizes the importance of measuring, recording, and predicting transient material behavior over the entire range of flight relevant environments. The feasibility demonstrated in Phase I will expand to a prototype technology capable of modelling a range of materials experiencing varying environmental conditions. Phase II will include ground testing of MDA specific materials and conditions, analytical modelling and validation testing in an arc-heater facility, culminating in the successful demonstration of a cost and time efficient, accurate process for developing thermal\/density response models of decomposing.Approved for Public Release | 18-MDA-9522 (23 Feb 18)"

        "abstract": "In previous exit cone insulator development for MDA and heat shield fabrication for NASA, Ultramet developed advanced foam-reinforced carbon\/phenolic ablators, now at TRL 6, that offer substantially increased performance under high heat flux conditions and reduced weight relative to conventional ablators. Solid rocket motor and arcjet testing showed that the foam provides effective reinforcement for a conventional chopped fiber ablator and helps retain the char layer, reducing erosion rate and heat transfer. The composite offers good strength and stiffness, does not suffer from delamination and pocketing issues that can occur in continuously reinforced ablators, and has demonstrated high resistance to alumina particulate erosion. However, the ablator formulation in ablator-filled foam contains carbonized rayon fiber from Enka (Germany). Through material fabrication and preliminary properties testing in Phase I, Ultramet demonstrated the initial feasibility of replacing carbonized rayon with carbonized Lyocell, which is domestically manufactured by a process that is not environmentally damaging. In Phase II, Ultramet will team with Southern Research, ARA Ablatives Laboratory, and Orbital ATK to optimize ablators containing carbonized Lyocell and perform solid rocket motor testing in support of OATKs development of a 21-inch tactical boost motor for the Standard Missile-3 Future Naval Capability third stage rocket motor.Approved for Public Release | 18-MDA-9522 (23 Feb 18)"

        "abstract": "SRICO proposes to develop electro-Optic (EO) phase modulators with stable and flat frequency response, low switching voltage-length product, and multi-decade environmental lifetime for use in strategic-grade high-precision inertial sensor systems. The electro-optic modulator lies at the heart of interferometric fiber-optic gyroscopes (IFOG) and accelerometer sensor systems and ultimately determines system precision and stability. Integrated optic lithium niobate modulators based on annealed proton exchange (APE) are typically used in these systems. However, APE waveguides suffer from temperature and time dependent frequency response because they are produced through a relatively low temperature ion exchange process. Higher temperature Ti-diffused processes yield relatively stable waveguides, but suffer from non-flat frequency response and photorefractive effects. Thus, there remains a need for electro-optic modulators with flat and stable frequency response over the decades of life span of the sensor system. To meet this need, this proposal develops advanced waveguide technologies that emulates the material properties of APE waveguides but that exhibits the long term stability of the high temperature Ti-diffusion process. Successful completion of this effort will have confirmed the favorable properties of the proposed waveguide optical phase modulator technology for use in precision inertial sensor application."

We propose to design a two-tap, common-core, passive, 3-phase inductor comprised of innovative tri-cores. We will compare ferromagnetic materials, conductive materials, inductor configurations, and switch types and perform a trade study of total weight vs total losses. Initial studies indicate the corrector supplies excellent power factor performance across the full load range: 20 kVA to 65 kVA remaining between 0.88 and 0.97 lagging. The inductor will be designed for all relevant environment and interface specifications. In Phase I, we will fabricate and demonstrate a form-fit-function breadboard power factor corrector at full rated power capable of correcting leading power factor to a target of 0.93 lagging in compliance with military standards. In the Option effort, we will optimize the mechanical, thermal and packaging aspects of the unit. In Phase II DTI will work with the Navy to ruggedize the system, and to integrate the mechanical and electrical interfaces into the target air frame. Finally in Phase III, DTI and partners will work to transition the technology to the Navy directly and to any potential commercial customers."

The proposed PFC hardware will be turned on\/off through a 400 Hz contactor, and will be installed into a rugged environmentally sealed housing. The proposed PFC hardware weighs less than 20 lbs, is &gt;99% efficient, is a small form factor, and relies only on natural convection cooling at the maximum ambient temperature of 71 deg. C. This passive magnetics based approach was selected over more complicated power electronic (active) based approaches as it provides a system that is much more reliable, rugged, and overall smaller and lighter."

        "abstract": "The primary objective of this Phase I proposal is to design, develop, and demonstrate the feasibility of a power factor compensation device for a 65 kVA, 115V, 400-Hz aircraft power system. Based on identified power factor conditions in the F-18 Super Hornet platform, the compensation system must correct an existing leading 0.98 power factor to a target lagging 0.93 (minimum objective lagging 0.97) with a weight of under 20 Lbs. This activity will include a trade-study developing both passive and active power factor compensation solutions to a sufficient level that PCKA and Navy personnel can select the preferred solution from a system perspective. In addition to the trade-study, the Phase I activity intends to demonstrate the feasibility that the selected approach can meet the weight and performance targets of the Navy, as well as the electrical and mechanical specifications of MIL-STD-461, MIL-STD-704, MIL-STD-810\/MDC3376. A combination of advanced modeling, simulation, and analysis (MS&amp;A) along with hardware demonstration where appropriate will be utilized to demonstrate that the proposed design is capable of meeting the identified requirements."

To support the range and signal fidelity needed to perform the surveillance, the equivalent isotropically radiated power (EIRP) requires significant improvement over existing solutions, especially in power density.NuWaves proposes the S-Band Transmit\/Receive Module Advancements for Efficient radars (STRAFE) project. Utilizing current gallium nitride (GaN) technology capable of generating hundreds of watts in a single RF transistor, NuWaves will leverage this power capability within a custom designed monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) housed within a highly capable T\/R module. NuWaves proposes to evaluate several novel thermal management techniques in order to provide the required power density at the lowest recurring cost to the T\/R module."

        "abstract": "Low-frequency radars operating in the VHF and UHF bands, like the AN\/APY-9 on-board the E-2D Hawkeye can detect and even track low-observable aircraft. But historically, UHF radars had resolution and detection issues that have made them ineffective for accurate targeting and fire control. Higher frequency radars provide the benefit of higher angular resolution. Migrating to higher frequencies (S-band) can enable weapons quality, high-resolution target tracks from the radar, thus guiding missiles accurately to the target. Higher frequencies also result in higher peak transmit power for radar systems to meet the link budget. Hence the Transmit-Receiver (T\/R) modules that support these frequencies to build a complete phased-array radar system need to be designed with high power-density to obtain desired Equivalent Isotropically Radiated Power (EIRP). IAI proposes a modular, low-profile MSPAR design to address this problem, and will meet the functional and operation requirements for Nay airborne radars."

The toolset must be able to consider combined effects from the multi-physics modules to predict the structural response of the target when subjected to weapon lethality analysis. Among them, modules for the calculation of detonation effects, structural analysis, weapon fragmentation, kinetic energy penetrators effect, shape charges effect, are present. The toolset will leverage existing capabilities for geometry handling (e.g. BRL CAD). The application will provide a Monte Carlo simulation feature that can vary the weapons terminal impact conditions and perform statistical variations of other input parameters in a scalable and efficient fashion. The software will be packaged leveraging the already existing Modeling &amp; Simulation platform, Endgame Framework."

Many of the algorithms\/methodologies for the physics-based calculations involved in maritime engagements already exist and have been developed by contractors and government agencies; however, they tend to be developed independently of each other resulting in a number of applications for analysis of these effects that have no way of communicating or cooperating with each other. The problem is that these methodologies are related and should be capable of working together to form a single answer\/solution to the scenario in question. Due to the separate development of these methodologies, analysis of problems that need input from all or some of the methodologies to form one cohesive solution just does not exist. The toolset developed under this proposed effort is intended to do just that and provide a means for integrating the existing methodologies into one cohesive analysis toolset."

These tools will be useful as an untapped resource to aid in ATS planning and support. Data mining can serve to expose run-time inefficiencies or under- and over-utilized test equipment (or specific capability ranges within a piece of equipment) and provide significant benefit to the selection of new ATE components during replacements and upgrades. Broad questions can be answered about ATE component capabilities including not only the frequency of their use but also the manner of their use. Additionally, such an analysis could identify economic targets of opportunity for the deployment of new and innovative test techniques."

        "abstract": "For years the DoD ATE community has been trying to build an open architecture environment that would support avionic testing across and within services. Little progress has been made in this area due to lack of applicable standards and a common vocabulary that could communicate test requirements required by the various users. This has led to non-standard designs in the ATEs and their associated tools. The proposal describes a method and approach that utilizes an appropriate set of existing IEEE standards designed to address this problem. However, these standards have not been utilized effectively based on the lack of guidelines for the selection of optional elements necessary to support the broad scope of use cases and common vocabulary of test parameters. The approach taken is to effectively utilize the modeling capability of the standard to build a library of signal models. A testing taxonomy structure of test categories and parameters will be used to identify these parameters. They will address both the UUT and ATE capabilities making the identification and utilization of a library of signal models that will allow for the development of a management tool that will be capable of supporting model development, TPS operation and resource interfacing."

        "abstract": "The automated test equipment (ATE) family provides state-of-art testing capabilities for weapons replaceable assemblies across the DoD. However, each ATEs testing capabilities are defined in a proprietary way. The absence of an open and standardized representation limits tool interoperability, makes it more difficult to use COTS automated tools, and can cause confusion in test station instrumentation. The Automated Test System (ATS) Framework Integrated Product Team identified the Automatic Test Markup Language (ATML), an IEEE standard, as a viable language to describe the capabilities of ATSs and test instruments.TSC proposes developing open architecture ATML Toolkit software that can describe ATE capabilities, catalog test instrument features, and display\/report information in a human readable format. The tool will store ATE capabilities in a reconfigurable database determined by the ATE family and its test instruments. From the database, the tool will generate a file adhering to the IEEE 1636 Test Results schema and display its output to a graphical user interface. The tool will be capable of parsing ATML files and augmenting the ATE capabilities database automatically. To aid in adopting ATML standards, TSC will also create a free open-source software tool for creating common signal models and ATML Test Instrument Description files."

The standards must provide this flexibility in order to accommodate the variety of applications for which they are intended. However, achievement of compatibility, interoperability and other objectives associated with the commonality are underlying assumptions of standards usage in general. Innovative approaches to controlling, restricting and even denying allowable variations can provide a vehicle for better achieving these objectives while still requiring adherence to the standards. These approaches can additionally improve usage of standards in regards to applications supporting definition of test hardware and instrumentation. Moreover, levels of precision and accuracy can potentially be enhanced through these same mechanisms. New strategic utilization and improvement of signal modeling related standards are focal points for these objectives. Currently standards allow users to develop widely disparate and essentially custom implementations that are still within compliance boundaries. Formulation of technical strategies that contain the independent development aspects of signal models can restrict the proliferation of disparate products developed from these standards. The innovative strategies would produce the interoperability, precision and even cross vendor compatibility the DoD is striving for."

        "abstract": "Survivability of military rotorcraft is a critical mission objective requiring extensive testing and analysis for various hover and flight modes of transport. Typical analysis requires Electro-Optic\/Infra-red (EO\/IR) and Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) sensing at a wide variety of environments, flight configurations, and sensor types and orientations using high-fidelity EO\/IR and LIDAR modeling. The principal difficulties associated with generating 3D rotorcraft plume signatures are two-fold: (1) the generation of 3D exhaust-plume flowfields in the presence of rotor blade downwash and complex vehicle geometries, and (2) the utilization of that data for composite signature predictions, which includes hot-parts emission, plume emission, and plume-shine reflection. The innovation described in this proposal is the development, verification, and demonstration of a computational framework that addresses currently observed deficiencies associated with rotorcraft-oriented EO\/IR signature modeling by combining within a single focused effort validated CFD and EO\/IR signature modeling capabilities to develop a streamlined rotorcraft signature prediction procedure that (1) minimizes multi-module data hand-off errors; (2) streamlines IR signature throughput via better data exchange synergy; and (3) establishes an effective baseline for supporting future advanced rotorcraft-focused signature physics modeling including the incorporation\/demonstration of an accurate and robust LIDAR capability into the new framework."

SPURC is widely used in the EO\/IR signature modeling community and is well validated for the prediction of UV-LWIR emissions from a low-altitude plume and thus ideally suited to rotorcraft applications. The Phase I effort will focus on developing an optimal integration approach, demonstrating the coupled CFD-EO\/IR capability for rotorcraft signature prediction, and investigating modeling fidelity tradeoffs. The effort will establish a variable-fidelity approach where modeling of complex physicssuch as aeroelastic blades and the inclusion of combustion byproductsmay be switched on and off in a hierarchical approach to understand their relative influence on the resulting signature. This approach also directly supports situations where advanced modeling parameters may not be known and lower-fidelity models are preferred."

        "abstract": "With the advanced testing at NAWCAD\/Pax of the CH53K underway, and the progressing multi-service Future Vertical Lift (FVL) initiative, there is clear need for modernized and rotorcraft-specific EO\/IR signature and susceptibility modeling tools. Moreover, these tools must possess trustworthy validation and be acknowledged as reference standards if they are to be accepted by and serve NAVAIR and DoD survivability groups. We propose to design, develop and deliver SPIRITS PLUS (Plume and LIDAR Upgrades for SPIRITS), an upgraded SPIRITS model with greatly-improved capability to model the signature effects of rotorcraft downwash and exhaust plume, and of laser radar. SPIRITS is nationally recognized and enjoys a long and broad history of validation against DoD and military systems. Our proposed effort brings together Aerodyne, developer of SPIRITS, Continuum Dynamics, Inc., nationally recognized experts in rotorcraft CFD, and Dr. Paul Markarian, developer of SPURC. The Phase 2 deliverable will be tested, documented, and ready for validation against field data, and will be suitable for furnishing to a Government Configuration Control Authority (CCA) for distribution and sustenance. It will also include software and version control modernization to enable the CCA to support a continuous-release cycle of incremental accrual and distribution of community-contributed enhancements."

UNIC, will be composed of several DOEs in a form of Computer Generated Holograms, designed digitally and arranged in a stacked setup with separation distance less than a millimeter. Thus, the cascaded CGHs can use free space propagation between these elements to handle the large spectral width and can exhibit a superior performance in uniformizing input beam, regardless of the beams starting spatial configuration. In Phase I, a single diffractive CGH will be demonstrated and spectral dependence will be investigated further. In Phase II, we will fabricate and demonstrate the UNIC system with 3 or 4 elements for the desired parameters for the agency. Thus, after completion, we believe that UNIC will provide innovative solutions to the beam homogenizers of the next generation."

        "abstract": "The output of the traditional optics fibers produce a Gaussian-shaped output due to the internal mode structure. Moreover, the output from traditional optical fibers contains spatial non-uniformities that are undesirable for certain applications. Many advanced applications require a flat-top intensity distribution of the laser beam as it produces uniform illumination and minimizes speckle. The Navy is seeking lightweight mid-infrared beam homogenizers capable to convert radiation from a multimode fiber to a flat-top beam. Among all-fiber techniques that use multimode fibers, flat top beam generation has only been demonstrated by fiber core shaping (fibers with e.g. square or rectangular cores). However the intensity profile of the beam maintains the same shape as the core and the rectangular or square beam shapes are difficult to efficiently integrate into existing circular-fiber based laser systems, resulting in significant loss of light. TIPD proposes to develop compact all-fiber low-loss circular-shaped homogenizer capable to operating across the 0.9-6 m spectral range. TIPDs homogenizers are based on novel infrared glass fibers with an advanced microstructured core design providing excellent mode mixing and a flat top beam output. The Phase I program will demonstrate the feasibility of developing such a novel all-fiber homogenizer for various Navy applications."

Preliminary Phase II prototype designs addressing the full system KPPs (SWAP) will be developed based upon promising optical designs and reviewed with Navy representatives. During a proposed Phase I Option, feedback from the preliminary prototype design review will be used to finalize the design of the Phase II prototype and detailed machine drawings will be prepared to enable rapid development of the technology at the start of the Phase II program. The prototype designs will be realized in the Phase II program and tested in applications of interest to the Navy.

Sensor systems will be directly interchangeable within the main body of the device to maintain a constant operational envelope as required for existing air launch A-sized buoy deployment. In Phase I, ISS will demonstrate the feasibility of the MOEP technology through design, assembly, and demonstration of the compact buoyancy control mechanism, submersible solar energy harvesting, and storage for use by the dynamic power system used by the sensor modules.

        "abstract": "With Proteus, our world class team proposes to leverage our extensive experience, existing technology, and a unique approach to deliver a low-cost, long lasting, multiple-profile oceanographic sensing and measurement device. Our experience in expendable dropsondes provides a baseline for an updated tactically relevant solution. Based on previous developments in the dropsonde area and similar R&amp;D efforts that increase the TRL by leveraging existing technologies, we can show feasibility in the short term while also hitting aggressive long term cost targets. Driven by a prime contractor with over 20 years of proven success commercializing technologies including maritime devices, Proteus promises success for NAVAIR and future transition partners. Our team and network of connections to the user community provide reduced risk with increased probability of transition. Proteus provides a persistent (12 months) solution that provides easily backhauled environmental, acoustic, thermal, and optic\/turbidity data through 1000 ft water columns at tens of dollars per profile. PH I will define the system design and test critical subsystems, enabling PH II success through use of our existing capabilities and technology in the oceanographic, dropsonde, and sensor markets and a focus on the main challenges of this specific development (persistence and cost)."

(ISS) proposes to develop a new Multiple Decoy Sub-payload Timed Automatic Release (MDSTAR) device. It is based on a cartridge assembly consisting of multiple ejectable, independently timed and triggered pyrophoric payloads. Specifically, the innovation in payload packaging design with integrated mechanical safety and adjustable timing fuse mechanisms will enable the MDSTAR device to accurately release and control the timing for multiple pyrophoric payloads from a single housing using a single standard CCU-136 impulse cartridge. As a result, this device offers a significant improvement to pyrophoric countermeasure IR signature and duration compared to existing countermeasure technology, which directly addresses the Navys need to protect aircraft against modern missile seekers. In Phase I, ISS will demonstrate the feasibility of MDSTAR by completing the design and simulation of the main housing and sub-payloads prior to fabricating representative prototypes and completing ejection performance testing. In Phase II, ISS plans to fabricate inert and fully functional prototype MDSTAR assemblies for Navy flight testing, achieving technology readiness level (TRL)-7 upon completion."

This decoy uses pyrophoric foils that react with atmospheric air upon release to give an infrared signature whose emissions are tailored to the threat sensors. The Navy has identified that greater protection would be afforded to aviators if the pyrophoric foils from a single countermeasure cartridge could be released in multiple increments rather than all at once. CMA Technologies, Inc. (CMA) is proposing a purely mechanical approach based on a proven, but inaccurate technology developed by our partner company Alloy Surfaces Company, the manufacturer of the MJU-49\/B. In this project CMA design an accurate, reliable and robust purely mechanical system that will give highly tailorable release of pyrophoric increments. The timing and number of increments can be easily set at time of manufacture. Our approach will be rugged enough to operate across the full MJU-49\/B environment to include temperature, vibration and shock and will have no HERO or electromagnetic concerns."

        "abstract": "As the Navy works to expand its capabilities against advanced seekers, there may be an opportunity to create pyrophoric countermeasures with carefully timed dispersion characteristics. The ideal pyrophoric countermeasure would rapidly maximize its cross-sectional area to make a desirable target in a pattern or shape which draws the seeker as far away from the aircraft as possible. A linear dispensing pattern consisting of multiple spaced packets may achieve this affect. In this proposal, Rocky Mountain Scientific Laboratory (RMSL) presents two novel concepts for the timed dissemination of pyrophoric foils from a MJU-49\/B compatible sub-payload. Downselected candidate payload design(s) will be fabricated for field impulse cartridge ejection testing using inert foils at the end of the Phase I effort."

Phase I approach is based on three areas: 4D Rendering, Microservice Architecture, and Data Architecture. The 4D Rendering area will perform studies that evaluate the technologies to overlay the 4D data. The Microservice Architecture area will focus on system design studies that will enable us to achieve our goal of developing decentralized solutions (autonomous services) that can be developed, operated, and deployed independently of the other services consumed by the product. Lastly, the Data Architecture area will focus on developing mission threads \/ use cases for rendering 4D data in order to design bounded context for which 4D overlays are used within the mission planning enterprise.Our studies will utilize forward looking technologies such as GraphQL, Cesium, and Service Oriented Architecture to develop a dynamic, pluggable tool that will aid in providing improved situational awareness to the Warfighter."

Specifically, tools are needed to generate and support 4-D geographically-referenced interactive overlays of multiple data sources for Situational Awareness (SA) to support tactical decisions and to rapidly assess those decisions. Future campaigns featuring peer-to-peer and advanced anti-access\/area-denied (A2\/AD) threat capabilities will be more dependent on synchronized full-spectrum Warfighter operations. Currently, there are no effective Joint and cross-domain integration processes and procedures among the various mission planning systems. The ability to interact directly with other Joint and cross-domain mission planners to support course of action analysis is also lacking.The proposed Dynamic Interactive Operations Display 4-D (DIOD-4D) will be a key enabler for mission planning in Joint\/Coalition, cross-domain operational environments. DIOD-4D will be used to develop, display, coordinate, and maintain planned aircraft\/standoff munitions\/ships\/ground routes, mission-critical operations potentially impacted by these routes, and other pertinent data and products needed for Force-level mission planning. Activities to supports force package planning include collaborative survivability assessments, lethality assessments, Operation Plan (OPLAN) development, temporal\/spatial deconfliction, synchronization of effects, battlefield visualization, analysis, and course of action assessment."

        "abstract": "In complex tactical scenarios, mission planners are often confronted with mission goals and operational environment restrictions that limit their options. High cognitive workloads produced by manual assessments and operational concerns increase tactical decision timeframes. To address these problems and support mission planning and operations within National and Foreign Airspaces, Space, Maritime, and Land domains, mission planners need automated planning assistance which can quickly animate (visualize) the routes and mission plans and the tactical risks to personnel and property. To maintain the tactical initiative, Mission planners and Battle Management Aids must optimize mission performance in faster than real-time under dynamic, multi-variable conditions allowing Mission Commanders to initiate tactical actions on their terms. LG-RAID addresses these shortcomings. Using LG-Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a multi-domain mission planner, LG-RAID constructs an optimal 4D, geo-rectified, animated overlay that provides entity visualization and predictive Course of Action analysis capability for dynamic, multi-variable conditions within seconds on a standard desktop computer."

Unlike quantum cascade lasers, optical selection rules in interband cascade lasers allow vertical emission. The massive parallelism of a VCSEL array will allow small, low power lasers to achieve high total output power with no speckle due to spatial incoherence across the array. Mid-infrared VCSELs have already achieved room temperature, continuous wave operation. We propose improving on state-of-the-art using several innovative approaches: growth on Si for improved thermal management; lower absorption cavity design; improved quantum well design; an oxide aperture to reduce loss by moving the optical mode and the pumped active region away from sidewalls, and improving their overlap; and electroplating with the very high thermal conductivity copper. To extract the heat, we propose modelling of heat pipes to spread the heat over a larger area, then a cold plate to extract heat from the heat pipe. To combine beams from different VCSELs, we propose using COMSOL ray matrix to model microlens arrays combined with macroscopic lenses."

With the inherent low efficiency of QCL devices, there is a limit to the amount of extra power that can be coaxed out of a device before the amount of waste heat generated overwhelms the available cooling. In order to increase the power output of these devices, and simultaneously reduce the thermal management needs, innovative pathways such as development of broad area vertical-cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSELs) could be beneficial. Here, Forward Photonics in combination with the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) propose to use a novel technique for controlling the output mode of a QCL to produce a broad area single spatial mode laser with high output power and efficiency."

The information then needs to be conveyed to the operator in a format that can be readily interpreted and used to make appropriate operational decisions to protect the air vehicle and meet mission objectives. The proposed Turbulence Recognition and Decision Support System for UAS is designed to quantify turbulence in two distinct ways: in terms of the level of turbulent energy in the atmosphere, and in terms of its impact on key air vehicle states including attitude, altitude, airspeed, and accelerations. The system relates the estimated quantities directly to operating limits and forecast values from weather products to support decision making by the UAS operator."

        "abstract": "An algorithmic approach for estimation of encountered turbulence intensity for UAS platforms is proposed for development, that leverage prior experience in development and testing of an icing detection scheme for tiltrotor aircraft. The methodology borrows from Fault Detection Filter design approaches, and uses a model-based scheme that is sufficiently general to permit its adoption onto a host of UAS platforms ranging in size and operational environment. Use of existing available data onboard the UAS avoids the need to install separate measurement systems, such as LIDAR-based sensors, and the system ultimately promises to help reduce structural fatigue loads on the UAS, leading to extended operational lifetimes. The Phase I program here will demonstrate the technology via limited simulation trials and a flight test program, and will provide sufficient risk reduction to allow for continued development to a prototype demonstration at the conclusion of the Phase II research and development program."

        "abstract": "Atmospheric turbulence is ubiquitous for all manned and unmanned flight vehicles, regardless of vehicle size and speed. Turbulence is generally compensated for by the pilot and flight control system and factors into aircraft design, flight envelope definition, and mission profile. If high-intensity turbulence is encountered, structural damage and\/or loss of control can result, leading to mission abort, and in extreme cases, catastrophic failure. For manned aircraft, the turbulence level is pilot-determined based on feel. For Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), detection and recognition of turbulence must be performed by other means. The Navy seeks a real-time, robust, low-computational-overhead, on-vehicle system for UAS to recognize and quantify turbulence severity levels. As a solution, we propose the Systems Technology, Inc. Turbulence REcognition AlgorithM (STREAM). STREAM will leverage existing sensors to quantify time-varying turbulence intensity levels in real-time using an efficient onboard frequency-domain-based algorithm that can be seamlessly applied as a software update to existing and future UAS of varying weight and speed class. These data can be sent to a remote operator for better-informed decision making or can be used for autonomous control algorithms on board. STREAM will be developed and demonstrated in Phase I via simulation with relevant UAS models."

The goal of the OMIPA system is to revolutionize the air mission and strike planning process through the application of advanced machine learning and artificial intelligence. Mission and strike planning is a difficult and time-consuming process. Given a variety of mission objectives, the space of possible mission plans to achieve those objectives is too large for human planners to exhaustively explore. OMIPA will revolutionize the mission and strike planning process through the integration of machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques. Technically, OMIPA will feature adaptations of cutting edge AI techniques, including case based analysis, semi-supervised learning, adversarial RL training of neural networks, Monte Carlo tree search, and evolutionary computation. These techniques will help human planners create better, highly robust plans more quickly and reliably for a range of missions; they have been chosen to avoid the technical challenges described above. Powerful ML and AI algorithms will drive OMIPAs ability to generate actionable insights in the mission planning process, but it is our staged approach to the development and implementation of OMIPA that will be the key to system success,"

GBL proposes to utilize its NO4-174 EA-18G Electronic Combat Automation SBIR technologies called Electronic Combat Decision Support System as a core technology that will be leveraged. RASP will provide a Distributed Intelligent Agent-based framework (DAI) to automate development of platform mission plans. The Agent-based framework implements a publish and subscribe message system to allow for collaborative and concurrent planning amongst multiple mission planning teams across security levels while minimizing the face-to-face communication that slows the mission planning process. The decentralized capability of RASP will reduce mission planning time by allowing multiple users to simultaneously plan their role in a mission vice the waterfall method of planning that is often practiced today. The intelligent agents will communicate planning information amongst necessary users to help improve the mission planning workflow and ultimately reduce the overall time and improve automation of mission planning for multi-vehicle strike mission platforms."

Operating in harsh desert or marine environments is the primary causes of debris buildup. A self-cleaning coating technology developed specifically for V-22 heat exchanger units will enable the aircraft to function more efficiently, and extend its operational range. We have identified an emerging Plasma Electrolytic Oxidation aluminum conversion coating process that transforms the metal surface into its own ceramic form. The ceramic state of the aluminum surface is able to receive our novel super-hydrophobic self-cleaning surface coating. Our new duplex coating technology has been evaluated for 3xxx series aluminum heat exchangers, and found to completely eliminate debris build up in harsh environments. In addition, to the delight of our sponsors, our developments also provide greatly reduced costs versus toxic aluminum anodizing and conversion coating techniques. We will provide our patented, environmentally benign, self-cleaning binary coating technology system to address all DoD needs and those of the global community for safer, yet completely effective systems to maintain the surface of V-22 heat exchanger units."

        "abstract": "Aluminum heat exchangers suffer from reduced performance and increased maintenance due to fouling. Of the coatings currently available for heat exchangers, most are severely fouled when the coating surface comes in contact with oils and dust. A superhydrophobic and oleophobic coating would reduce fouling and make cleaning easier. Nano Terra has developed a coating for aluminum parts, called NT-AL, based on a textured, low energy surface which completely resists wetting by water and oil. The coating is &lt; 30 micrometers thick and so would not interfere with heat transfer. It is erosion resistant and is intimately bonded to the aluminum surface so that the coating will be robust even in high particulate environments. In this program, Nano Terra will refine the NT-AL process for the Navys heat exchangers and verify the maintained performance, fouling resistance and wear resistance. In parallel, Nano Terra will develop a low-surface energy polymer coating with a textured surface that will provide similar superhydrophobicity and oleophobicity to NT-AL but potentially better erosion resistance and different chemical stability. Finally, Nano Terra will apply the best two of these approaches to heat exchangers and show improved performance in fouling conditions."

During operation, the outside environment brings in the dust, grime, oil and sand which can foul the heat exchanger surface. Deposits on the surface create an insulating layer that increases the thermal resistance and reduces the process efficiency. Regular maintenance of the heat exchanger is required to clean off the surface, reducing military readiness by the taking aircraft out of the service and consuming funds on maintenance activities that could otherwise go for active missions. In this SBIR project, TDA will develop a hydrophobic and oleophobic surface coating that would repel dirt and fouling to prevent it from building up in the first place. The coating will be applied as a thin film layer, uniformly across the heater exchanger fins in a low-cost industrial process. In the Phase I project, we will demonstrate that the coating has hydrophobic\/oleophobic properties, measure heat transfer properties across a coated test panel, and characterize its physical properties."

        "abstract": "There is an ongoing need to improve the design of low-frequency, high-power, broadband sonar transducers for use in A-sized sonobuoys. Desired improvements include lowering the frequency, increasing the power, increasing bandwidth, reducing size, reducing weight, and lowering cost. Most sonobuoy applications currently utilize flextensional or flexural transducers that use piezoelectric PZT type ceramics for transduction. Single crystal piezoelectric ceramics have been investigated as possible improvements to PZT. A major drawback, however, is that they are costly and are size restricted which limits low-frequency and high-power usage. Recently, textured PMN-PT ceramics have been developed. They have piezoelectric properties that approach those of single crystal ceramics, with the advantages that it can be fabricated in larger sizes with lower cost and can be driven at higher drive levels. Therefore, a transducer made with this material has the potential to produce more source level and can also can be designed to be more compact, lighter, have a broader bandwidth, and higher effective coupling than one using PZT. During Phase I of this SBIR Program, Massa will develop an A-sized transducer for sonobuoys using textured ceramics that will contain the desired improvements."

The projector performance metrics in particular that need improvement include: higher source level, lower operating frequency and increased bandwidth while minimizing weight. This is easier to do when size and power are not limited, however, due to the sonobuoy A-size form factor (4 7\/8 x 36) space constraints there is a limitation on the size and power, and that is the challenge that must be overcome. The objective of this SBIR program is to design, develop, fabricate, and demonstrate a projector that exploits the enhanced properties of PMN-PT textured ceramic. The new piezoelectric material, PMN-PT texture ceramic, presents the opportunity to address the challenge of increasing an active sonobuoy performance metrics for low frequency response, increased sound pressure level (SPL), increased bandwidth, while still capable of being packaged in the size constraints of an A-size sonobuoy( 4 7\/8 x 12) when other necessary components of the sonobuoy such as surface electronics, subsurface electronics, subsurface batteries, suspension and cable pack are factored into the space budget."

Tetramer proposes to develop a new cushion material based on polyurethane elastomers. Tetramer has previously used this chemistry to develop elastomers with improved chemical resistance, hydrolytic stability, and tear strength. The Phase I effort will aim to demonstrate enhanced material performance against the combined effects of UV, ozone and hydraulic fuel exposure.

Under the PMA 265 Acquisition Program, it is expected to push the flight hours of the Hornets Service Life Extension Program from 6,000 flight hours in some cases beyond 10,000 flight hours. A current issue associated with the maintenance of the aircraft platforms are the indirect costs associated with clamp cushion (MIL-DTL-85052 B clamp loop cushion) failures that crack shortly after installation on aircrafts due to Ultraviolet (UV) and ozone exposure. Given this situation, the Navy is seeking alternative materials for hydraulic clamp cushions that are resistant to UV and ozone exposure and compatible with the respective JP-4 (MIL-DTL-5624) and petroleum based hydraulic fluid (MIL-PRF-5606) used by the Navy. To address the challenge of this Phase I opportunity, Lynntech will develop an omniphobic, UV and ozone resistant cushion material for the MIL-DTL-85052 B clamp that is highly responsive to the Navys unique environmental requirements for their hydraulic, fuel and electrical clamp applications."

        "abstract": "HMC has chosen to employ a two-pronged approach to our ECC research and development efforts. The first approach involves research and identification of hybrid elastomeric compounds that can be engineered for long-term stability in the difficult mechanical and environmental conditions required for this application. The first path in this effort Includes research and development of fabric based hybrid materials that can be coaxed with an elastomer mordant. Combining or coaxing fabric or fiber strands within a compatible polymer will not only improve UV and ozone resistance, but also serve as a binder capable of providing the tensile and elastic properties needed for U.S. Navy aircraft clamp cushioning. HMCs second research and development effort will focus on reconfiguring the current mechanical portion of clamp assembly, concurrent with the development of the ECC cushion component. This effort will include redesign of the metallic core of the loop clamp so that the cushion can be easily installed and securely fastened within a recess or slot positioned at the inside diameter of the clamp. The objective of this design modification is to expand the list of candidate elastomer compounds that can be considered for improving the manufacturability of the entire clamp."

        "abstract": "The detection of small objects on the ocean surface at long stand-off distances is an ongoing need of the Navy. Current Periscope Detection Radar systems lack the spatial resolution needed to detect small objects, have large SWaP, and are not suitable for small aircraft and rotorcraft. Alternatively, LIDAR systems exist which have high spatial resolution and long operating ranges, but suffer from low scan rates, and therefore limited scan areas, due to the low repetition rates (100s of Hz) of the bulk-optic lasers used. Lastly, in order to achieve high probability of detection and low false-alarm rates, a means to discriminate the hard return signal from a periscope or buoy from waves and surface movement.To address this need, SA Photonics proposes the development of our HawkEye LIDAR system. HawkEye utilizes our high repetition rate Master Oscillator Power Amplifier (MOPA) fiber-based laser system that enables the ability to scan a large target area. The HawkEye system is a complete LIDAR detection system with built-in beam scanning, and high sensitivity digital receiver. The Hawkeye system is compact and low SWAP and is compatible with sky ball turrets on MH-60 and equivalent aircraft."

Physical Sciences Inc., in collaboration with our subsidiary Q-Peak Inc., proposes to develop a SWIR lidar for long-range detection of periscopes in maritime environments from aircraft at both low and high altitudes. Our SWIR lidar utilizes a highly compact, state-of-the-art solid state laser transmitter operating at 1.5 m for eye safety. Our laser transmitter design benefits from experience gained while developing a related, multispectral solid state laser transmitter for the Navy in support of the Coastal Battlefield Reconnaissance and Analysis (COBRA) program.

        "abstract": "The invention in this proposal provides significant improvements for uncooperative submarine periscope detection and identification through the development of a hybrid multi-mode sensor, consisting of a combined direct-detection imaging flash lidar and a micro-Doppler coherent lidar that would dramatically enhance the effectiveness of operational airborne mission instruments. The lidar solution proposed will have a large field-of-view (FOV) active imaging sensor for basic, yet fast, object detection, a high-power transmitter for long range capability, an electro-optical beam steering aperture for a larger collection area\/small volume and reliability, and a highly sensitive active interrogation sensor for false alarm mitigation and target identification. While the optical signal and receiving detector(s) are different for the two technologies, significant overlap of components can exist if carefully designed; e.g., common scanner, pump lasers, signal processing hardware, and thermal management. The focus of this project will be to provide a lidar where the wide-beam (near) photon-limited direct detection flash lidar acquires detections and very quickly, in-turn the narrow-beam coherent detection lidar is directed to the detection position to interrogate and confirm\/reject those detections as periscope targets. This track-while-scan system with the potential to provide on-location target identification has the ability to be a game-changing US military asset."

        "abstract": "Whether a laser-based system is used to autonomously detect and recognize a periscope, or the laser-based system is used as a complement to a radar-based periscope detection system, the timeliness of the laser-based detection is critical. Electronically steering the pointing direction of the laser and the field of view of the laser receiver enables a timely response by the laser-based system to any breaching of the sea surface by a periscope. The emerging technology of diffractive waveplates enables electronic beam steering for narrowband systems such as lasers and active imagers along with electronic control of illumination spot size. In conjunction with a high-efficiency, short pulse laser illuminator and high sensitivity laser receiver, we propose an electronic beam and field of view steering system that can address any location in the field of regard within a response time that is orders of magnitude shorter than the time it would take to slew a conventional gimbal system over a comparable angle. In addition to enabling rapid response and high resolution detection, electronic beam and field of view steering is expected to have a major favorable impact on system size, weight, and power consumption."

These craft may be operated by forces from recognized adversaries such as Iran or North Korea, by Rogue States or by violent non-state actors whose ideology encourages violence against US interests. To counter this threat, the US Navy is developing new tactics and technologies to reduce the threat from FACs in littoral waters. Rapidly detecting, identifying, and tracking small fast attack craft using multispectral electro-optical imaging is a key force multiplier for the US Navy. The proposed high speed multispectral imager uses the polarization of the reflected light to reduce the background signal and to provide additional information on targets in the area of interest. The multispectral polarization imaging system (MPIS) will be compact and light enough to be used in both fixed-wing and rotary-wing naval aircraft."

        "abstract": "Detection, classification\/recognition, and tracking surface vessels on water is very challenging for many reasons. Haze, marine layer, and\/or other particulates can attenuate signal and create path background radiance, all of which reduce the contrast of the target against the background. The intensity and spatial frequencies of the background often mimic the surface vessel making acquisition and tracking of the target difficult. As stated in the solicitation, water wakes from fast moving boats such as the Fast Attack Craft (FAC) can produce wakes that have similar signatures or partially obscure the target.  Polaris Sensor Technology proposes to design in Phase I and develop in Phase II a Visible\/NIR, SWIR, MWIR, LWIR imaging polarimeter with 15 to 3 degree zoom capability. Polarization has been shown to increase contrast and reject background noise in multiple wavebands. Polaris will combine multi-spectral sensing, polarimetry and advanced image processing algorithms to develop robust acquisition, tracking, and classification capability in a single sensor."

        "abstract": "To address the Navys need for a Future Airborne Capability Environment (FACE)-compliant Countermeasure Dispenser System (CMDS) Operational Flight Program (OFP), Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new CMDS FACE-compliant Interoperable Reusable Software (CFIRS). CFIRS is based on a novel implementation of an adaptation layer that provides an interface between the CMDS native code to the underlying computing hardware environment. As a result, the current hardware-specific, tightly-coupled CMDS OFP becomes FACE-compliant and thus portable to a variety of hardware platforms irrespective of its hardware type, operating system (OS), or input\/output (IO) interfaces. Due to this, the code can be reused in a variety of different platforms with FACE-computing environments without major development requirements thus reducing redevelopment costs. This, in addition to POCs infrastructure and experience in developing FACE-compliant military avionics, will be leveraged in the CFIRS development to provide POC a head start in transitioning CFIRS to the Navy. In Phase I, POC will demonstrate the feasibility of CFIRS though system analysis and will develop limited capability software reaching technology readiness level (TRL)-3\/-4. In Phase II, POC plans to develop a fully functional prototype that will reach TRL-5\/-6 and be ready for initial tests at Navy facilities."

        "abstract": "Successful software systems eventually outlive the hardware they are deployed upon and must be migrated to a modern platform. The AN\/ALE-47 Operational Flight Program (OFP) is an example of such a system. Migration to a new platform incurs risk because it requires some level of change to the existing code base. Great cost and effort in testing and maintenance have been invested to bring the system to maturity. This is especially true of mission-critical tactical systems. However, migration offers the opportunity for enhanced performance, greater interoperability, and reduced software lifecycle costs. A balanced approach is required that maximizes gains in performance, interoperability, and lifecycle cost savings while minimizing risk and the cost of migration. SimVentions believes it has the experience, knowledge, and tools to provide such an approach. SimVentions will rely upon the knowledge gained as a member of the Future Airborne Capability Environment (FACETM) Consortium, the experience of re-hosting the Nulka Controller software in a Data Distribution Service (DDS) environment, and tools developed for other efforts like Dexter, Tactical Monitoring and Injection Tool (TCMIT), and Ada to C++ to re-host the AN\/ALE-47 to run on the Intel i7 or Xeon processor in a FACE environment."

SimVentions proposes an AN\/ALE-47 Automated Test Engine (A2TE) that interfaces to the existing AN\/ALE-47 Software Test Environment (STE) to automate the different phases of the testing. The A2TE will utilize dynamic message discovery, extraction, and validation by leveraging and modifying existing SimVentions tools to support test scenario generation, setup, and execution of multiple scenarios to provide automated operator and sensor inputs to test the system performance, without manual intervention. This test engine will implement a model-based system characterization of the different MDF configurations to evaluate system performance using automated data reduction and analysis to provide reporting. To facilitate test scenario setup and provide a foundation for scenario development, a generic framework for defining scenario conditions and inputs, message contents, valid sequences, timing, and expected responses will be developed. The intent is to combine these new test engine components with existing test capability in the AN\/ALE-47 STE, to provide an automated test solution to increase software reliability and reduce cost and schedule related to the manual test process."

        "abstract": "The ALE-47 Countermeasures Dispenser Set (CMDS) is installed on almost all Navy aircraft and is a vital component of the Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE) Suite. Each Type\/Model\/Series of aircraft utilizes a Mission Data File (MDF) which is mission-critical software that must undergo extensive testing prior to fielding. Each MDF must be tested against a different set of system inputs across different scenarios and conditions. The current manual testing process which includes platform-specific script generation, manual operation of the Software Test Environment (STE) and manual validation that the system is meeting performance specifications, can greatly benefit from automation to reduce cost and schedule and increase test coverage. This proposal addresses these challenges by the unique application of end-to-end automation applied to the entire lifecycle of MDF testing. This end-to-end automated testing solution is centered on a system model that defines the overall behavior of the ALE-47 system. This model, along with recorded test data is used to support generation of automated test artifacts including: automated STE scenario scripts, test execution flows that automatically operate the STE during test events, analysis cases for requirements verification, System Requirement Verification Matrix (SRVM) to provide test validation and automatically generated Objective Quality Evidence (OQE) reports."

AviatorDX will integrate data collection and fusion of metrics from multiple modalities in order to provide a set of comprehensive performance measures for Live, Virtual and Constructive flight training exercises. Our approach is to adapt and exploit advanced data science approaches, including Bayesian inference technology, to develop an optimal data solicitation schema that will improve its competency estimation model through machine learning as it gains experience. Perceptronics Solutions recognizes the criticality of performance assessment as an element of effective training. For this project, we will leverage two directly related previous Navy efforts; these are: (1) MPMS (Multi-Modal Performance Measurement System) is an assessment tool that will capture performance data from a variety of live, virtual, and constructive sources. MPMS will also provide data-derived performance measures, identify skill deficits, trace deficit sources, and prescribe remediative performance enhancing evolutions. (2) DECIDE (Diagnostic Engine for Cognitive Improvement and Decision Effectiveness) will provide AviatorDX with an innovative methodology for observer-based training assessment, diagnosis and improvement. We will adapt and extend the capabilities of DECIDE and MPMS to meet the goals of the AviatorDX project."

        "abstract": "Using integrated teams of Operational Analysts experienced with Naval aircrew training and Software Engineers experienced in developing dynamic analysis and reporting tools for aviation, a pragmatic and scalable approach to aircrew performance assessment and proficiency is proposed. Initial techniques to incorporate data fusion of disparate data sources are summarized from past experience and existing software solutions. These techniques can be applied to aircrew performance assessment to reduce instructor work-load while also increasing the speed and accuracy of assessment. A process outline to decompose training scenarios in a manner that supports automation, human-in-the-loop techniques, and advanced data science is presented for further refinement during the research. The methodologies proposed for research all include the ability to scale across multiple platforms, training devices, training missions, and aircrew configurations through innovative application of modern programming paradigms. The end result is a design realizing this innovation in a user-oriented toolset supporting actionable feedback in a performance assessment and proficiency system."

        "abstract": "The objective of this proposal is to design a software solution that consolidates performance data from multiple sources to ensure that data collection and assessment processes are accurate, efficient, and effective. The designed solution will leverage the work already conducted by NAVAIRs Training Analysis Project (TAP) regarding F\/A-18 air warfare. In doing so, the software will adhere to training best practices and align with the performance metrics that TAP has already identified as being critical to mission success in Component Commander plans. Since TAPs processes were designed to be scalable, this software will provide a methodology for the NAE to duplicate the entire TAP process for other platforms and mission sets in a manner that is streamlined and efficient. Artificial intelligence will be applied to enable automated and semi-automated methods for collection of data, assessment of performance, and reporting of training deficiencies. This improves the speed and effectiveness of the feedback to the trainee and the NAE leadership. The software will be designed to reside on hardware that is already resident at Fleet training locations (to reduce the physical footprint) and will incorporate an intuitive user interface (to minimize the need for additional aircrew training)."

        "abstract": "The Navy seeks to leverage data science-based tools, methods, and principles to achieve a warfighting advantage over our enemies. For example, aggregate data regarding Warfighter proficiency could help the Navy to make better-informed decisions on topics such as curriculum redesign, simulator acquisitions, and weapons platform acquisitions. However, in order to create such a proactive and predictive decision capability, the Navy first needs to develop reliable, valid, and unobtrusive measures of Warfighter proficiency that can be collected during training. Additionally, the Navy needs to develop a big data infrastructure that can integrate the Warfighter proficiency dataacross squadrons, training events, missions\/tasks, and timeto identify meaningful trends that will guide decision making activities throughout the Naval command hierarchy. To address this critical need, Aptima will develop the Aircrew Performance Measurement and Proficiency System (A-PuMPS). When complete, A-PuMPS will contain two primary system components. The first component is training-focused; it will ingest streaming simulator data to develop reliable, valid, and unobtrusive measures of Warfighter proficiency during training. The second component is data science-focused. It will systematically merge, aggregate, de-identify, store, clean, fuse, visualize, and model the Warfighter proficiency data to support proactive, data science-driven decision making."

The proposed SD-Link will build on the team&apos;s previous published work in FSO communications using spatial diversity and the team&apos;s previous STTR collaborations. SD-Link will combine proven multiple-input-multiple-output equalization, spatial diversity, beam tracking, and digital signal processing to improve reliability of current FSO communications. The Phase I will focus on system design of the spatial diversity FSO communication link as well as the beam tracking system. In Phase II, the team will build on the Phase I design to further mature SD-Link. Specifically, in Phase II the team will demonstrate performance of the optical links using modeling and simulation, prototype critical elements and demonstrate in a controlled environment, quantify the benefits of SD-link compared to existing techniques in similar environments, develop an approach to air vehicle integration, and identify remaining technology challenges. In Phase III, R-DEX will work with its academic and industrial partners to further develop SD-Link for both Government and commercial applications."

        "abstract": "Free-Space Optical (FSO) communication systems have numerous advantages over traditional RF based wireless systems including high data rates, long link distances, extremely low probability of interception and detection, and the ability to operate in RF denied environments with complete resistance to jamming. Additionally, compared to RF systems, FSO systems have very low Size, Weight and Power (SWaP). These advantages are often viewed to be hampered by the challenges of operating through the atmosphere, which creates scintillation and absorption that can disrupt the communication link. To address these issues, SA Photonics has developed innovative techniques that provide robust and reliable communication through a wide variety of atmospheric conditions, while maintaining a simple and low-cost system architecture. There are currently no FSO systems in use today on airborne platforms, mainly due to the need to use large and expensive stabilized gimbals. SA Photonics AgileBeam FSO system includes internal optical beam stabilization that allows the terminal to be directly attached to the aircraft, greatly reducing the cost to deploy and allowing use even on small UAVs. With the resulting compact size and robust and reliable performance, AgileBeam promises to enable widespread transition to the warfighter."

TWS approach will lead to the development of a cyber-physical system which integrates its physics-based modeling, NC toolpath optimization and data collection capabilities into a closed-loop adaptive control machining system. The system will monitor real-time force and temperature data, compare with an optimized digital baseline, and adjust the machining parameters to control machining-induced damage, optimize material removal rate and improve tool life. The resulting manufacturing data including temperature, forces, hole quality and dimensional accuracy will be retained and integrated into a part digital twin providing needed traceability of the part manufacturing process.

        "abstract": "Waterjets are widely used to cut and trim composites and techniques have been developed to trepan and pierce materials without causing delamination or fiber break-out on the exit side. However, using waterjets to mill countersunk holes has not been demonstrated before. This project will use a patented waterjet milling process to show that waterjets can successfully mill countersunk holes in composite materials for airframe structures without damaging the material. The proposed process is robust, reliable, inexpensive and very flexible, cutting holes from as small as 0.060 to inches in diameter, without the risk of heat damage to the material. The process is projected to be much faster than mechanical cutting tool methods and the nozzle wear life is in excess of 70,000 holes. Waterjet equipment already at the Fleet Readiness Centers could be used to cut stand-alone parts and tooling can be developed to drill holes in-situ on aircraft. In addition to carbon fiber products, the process can also be used to cut glass and aramid fiber reinforced product and even cut laminated titanium-graphite materials. The process works on inclined holes and laminated structures that include composites over metal framework."

        "abstract": "To address the Navys need for a maritime Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) System using ISAR data for the Tomahawk Missile, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new ATR System, Automated Identification of Maritime ISAR Targets (AIMIT). It is based on modern deep-learning techniques for identification of objects and salient features in image data. Specifically, the innovation in using deep- learning image recognition algorithms for maritime ISAR targets will enable the Tomahawk Missile navigation component to accurately target hostile ships, while avoiding innocent bystanders. Additionally, AIMIT deep-learning algorithms are computationally efficient at runtime and updatable via parameter files. As a result, this technology offers a high probability of correct identification, computational throughput sufficient for a 5 Hz update rate, and the capability to readily update the system with new targets. It directly addresses the Tomahawk Missile Program requirements for SWaP, update rate, and classification accuracy. In Phase I, POC will demonstrate the feasibility of AIMIT by demonstrating the performance against either a synthetic or experimental dataset, reaching TRL-3. In Phase II, POC plans to develop a prototype to show that the performance of AIMIT against representative data is acceptably high, bringing the technology to TRL-4."

Our Phase 1 program will develop a practical machine-learning based ISAR ATR system that addresses these challenges. The system will be designed to achieve high target recognition and confuser rejection performance, to be robust to target state and environmental conditions, to be easily extensible to classification of new targets, and so that online processing may be implemented on low SWAP hardware to meet demanding smart munitions timelines. To create this design, the Phase 1 effort will integrate and utilize high fidelity RF propagation and scattering simulations to drive trade study analyses that will identify deep learning architecture attributes, model training strategies, and sensing and signal processing approaches that address seeker-based ISAR target recognition challenges in maritime environments."

In congested territory that includes enemy and friendly ships, it is essential for the missile to main target track with extremely low false alarm rate to minimize collateral damage.

In poor condition, where there is low return signal to high interference, ATR systems simply do not work.To address this critical need, Intelligent Automation, Inc (IAI) proposes to develop an Intelligent Feature Extractor for Maritime Target (IFEMT) system based on deep learning.

This track management task can be overwhelming today, and will become more difficult with new adversary approaches such as unmanned air systems and swarming surface tactics including saturation raids. While AEGIS provides some capabilities for automatically identifying potential threats, making recommendations, and even engaging threats, its decisions are based on fairly rigid rules that do not take into account the current context in which the ship is operating. Instead, watchstanders must build up and provide their own context about the battlespace, the geo-political environment, and the normal background activities that occur in the environment. By not taking this information into account, current AEGIS tools leave the operators with too many tracks to manage on their own. SoarTech and team propose to design, develop and assess a ship-board Virtual Assistant to significantly reduce the workload of AEGIS operators. This Virtual Assistant will help watchstanders make decisions by learning relevant information from the environment and the watchstanders, providing additional context for decision-making, and making recommendations about tracks and potential responses."

IDA observes operators actions and interactions at the Aegis console. It interacts with the operator via standard console input and assists them to navigate, retrieve, and understand the vast amount of data from multi-INT data sources. IDA will alert the operator with critical events and recommend possible COAs in near real time as data becomes available. IDA will learn the operator behavior on the console using advance AI techniques and will continuously learn or adapt itself to provide personalized information to the user that will be contextually relevant to the user and mission. IDA will be taught by the operator, albeit indirectly, to assist them to identify and present contextually relevant information sourced from multiple disparate data banks relevant to the operator tasking."

VIMs act as a shock absorber that attenuates effects of mechanical noise caused by ship motion and the tow cables strum. The proposed effort will use a comprehensive materials-based approach to toughen the VIMs outer jacket against widely-used high-tension fishing longlines, with 1000&apos;s of fish hooks, which can span more than 10 kilometers in length. The proposed approach will leverage the latest developments in fabric reinforced rubbers and advanced additives to develop a wear and cut-resistant VIM jacket materials for improved service like performance. Material selection and testing will be optimized using statistical Design of Experiments. Experimental results will be validated using computer simulation modeling. A major objective of the proposed approach is to preserve the current manufacturing methods and supply base so the SBIR technology can be transitioned into the fleet in a time and cost-efficient manner."

        "abstract": "As described by the Navy, a surface ship towed array VIM (Vibration Isolation Module) hose that is resistant to cuts, abrasions, perforation, and other mechanical damage is needed by the Navy. The surface ship fat line VIM is a fluid filled hose that reduces the low frequency vibrations experienced by towed array sensors, such as the TB37 surface ship towed arrays, by attenuating the vibration through the VIM and especially through the hose wall. However, the soft hose material used in current VIM hoses is susceptible to cuts from floating materials such as fishing lines. A cut-resistant towed array VIM hose would increase the availability of existing surface ship towed arrays and reduce lifecycle costs. The Navy seeks innovative approaches to providing vibration isolation to, while reducing or eliminating susceptibility to cutting or puncturing hazards often experienced during towing, deployment, and retrieval operations. Mid proposes to develop a custom hose which includes a layer of protection to significantly minimize, if not eliminate, the risk of cutting the hose and maintain the vibration attenuation properties. The proposed solution has the potential to meet all the goals of this topic at a cost similar to the current hoses used in the VIM."

The topic description continues to define some of the key attributes of the Quad Small Form-factor Pluggable (QSFP+) transceiver module that the Navy sponsor, and the herein proposed work, aims to ruggedize. A critical problem inherent in the available commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) QSFP+, and related transceiver (TRX) modules, E\/O connectors and interfaces, is that none of them are designed and manufactured per relevant military standards; and therefore, all of them will suffer routine and frequent failures in environments that induce high vibration, radiation and\/or broad thermal operating conditions. These failures must be mitigated via a rugged-by-design and manufacture, drop-in replaceable QSFP+ TRX module alternative. the Nanomatronix team seeks to develop the Ruggedized QSFP+, or &apos;R-QSFP+&apos; product line specifically for harsher environment high bandwidth applications, including aircraft, naval craft and spacecraft per relevant standards."

        "abstract": "The Submarine Force is phasing out conventional optical periscopes in favor of digital sensor masts that electronically transmit video to the Control Center. Digital imagery still suffers from distortions due to atmospheric turbulence caused by humidity and temperature gradients near the ocean surface. While systems for turbulence correction exist, they have largely focused on static scenes and rely on precise image alignment of multiple frames to produce clean images. However, submarine imagery comes from a moving camera capturing a moving target, in a moving scene making alignment infeasible, and results must be available quickly (i.e., the system cannot wait for multiple frames before producing output). Therefore, existing mechanisms for correcting blur and loss of contrast cannot be effectively applied to turbulence correction for submarine imagery. To address these shortcomings, we propose Turbulence Mitigation, Error Reduction, and Increased Contrast (TURMERIC), a software system that uses deep learning to correct for atmospheric turbulence in imagery such that watchstanders and automated detection algorithms can optimally detect surface contacts. Specifically, TURMERIC uses a generative adversarial network (GAN), a powerful new deep learning architecture, to intelligently de-blur and enhance the contrast of photonics mast imagery using only a single frame."

The simulation can be exercised to demonstrate the interaction of the various relevant system elements (threat types, assumed capability of the incoming threat, number of threats, operational and test environment conditions, clutter and debris) that have the highest probability of kill.

It is possible that the internal atmospheric pressure could be increased up to 5X during a DISSUB scenario; currently, there is no method to lower that internal pressure. ADA Technologies proposes a method to decrease that internal pressure, thereby increasing the chance of survival by crewmembers. The Decompression of Internal Pressure of Submarine ATmosphere (DIPSAT) System will over-pressurize and subsequently vent gas from the DISSUB. The DIPSAT system will have the ability to be man-powered, in the case of no available onboard electricity. The proposed effort will leverage the high-pressure gas storage and delivery system design experience of the ADA team with the experience of the Lockheed Martin Rotary and Mission Systems division, as well as the extensive experience of DOER Marine Operations, an underwater technology company. During the Phase I Base Period, we will design the DIPSAT system and perform a small-scale demonstration of the concept. In the Option Period, if awarded, we will design and demonstrate the manually-powered compression system with the DIPSAT system."

        "abstract": "The US Navy has determined that the ability to decompress distressed submarines (DISSUB) before crewmembers are rescued could improve the survival rate. For various reasons, its likely that a DISSUB that ends up on the bottom of the ocean will have an internal pressure above 1 atm. If decompression of the DISSUB can be achieved before the crewmembers are rescued, this can significantly decrease, decompression requirements and the risk of oxygen toxicity, nitrogen narcosis, and decompression sickness.To achieve this, Air Squared is proposing the development of a Seawater Flooded Scroll Compressor with a Tribrid Power system (SFSC-TP). The seawater flooded scroll compression system, will utilize sea water, to seal, lubricate and cool the compression process, in order to compress the DISSUB internal atmosphere and discharge it external to the DISSUB. The SFSC-TP will be autonomously powered independent of the shipboard electrical power through the use of three sources, this includes stored energy in the ships high-pressure air banks using a scroll air expander, seawater pressure using a scroll hydro turbine, and a self-contained battery. This will allow the SFSC-TP to deliver a comprehensive solution which can provide maximum decompression depending on available power sources, DISSUB depth, and decompression volume."

        "abstract": "Future Navy pulsed power systems, including lasers, directed energy systems, and railguns will require short-term prime power sources exceeding currently available shipboard capacity. Battery systems are being developed to support this peak power demand on an as-needed basis. Batteries can be charged over a relatively long period of time at low power from an existing AC or DC bus. Ripple current is a primary factor of merit for battery charging, as it contributes to internal heating, and accelerates degradation of the battery cells. Ultra-low ripple, variable-rate charging and voltage maintenance of these batteries will require compact, efficient, EMI-tolerant, and reliable battery chargers capable of operation over a range of current, voltage, and power settings. Under this SBIR effort, Diversified Technologies, Inc. will develop and deliver a Compact, Ultra-Low Ripple, 1000V, 35 kW Battery Charger with a power density greater than 3 MW\/m3. Variable-parameter output modes will provide charging and battery maintenance over a range of commanded current, voltage, and power profile conditions, and will include a low-power maintenance discharge capability."

Our research will build on this foundation to establish methodologies for integrating cybersecurity analysis.Our research approach will address the shortfalls identified by the topic to achieving the detailed level of data collection necessary to model and integrate relevant system attributes to enable a unified cybersecurity analysis platform. Our engineers and system modelers have developed and deployed an efficient data collection strategy that allows for rapid consumption of information housed in non-electronic and physical data stores. This strategy has been used to generate models of more than 18,000 end-to-end architectural elements, mission threads and interface requirements. We will research ways to expand this methodology to integrate additional cybersecurity relevant analytics within a unified, data concordant model."

        "abstract": "There are many challenges associated with delivering new capabilities to a Naval Combatants. Because Combat Systems can apply lethal effects, ensuring the interoperability of the components and applications that comprise Naval combat systems such as AEGIS is a critical and essential task. Introducing a new capability or updating a single subsystem requires testing and certification of the subsystem as well as the system as a whole. This alone is expensive and time consuming. But, the reality is that by adding or updating one subsystem, other subsystems must also be updated. This additional activity only increases the cost and time it takes to deliver capabilities to the warfighter. SimVentions offers to define a new methodology, based on the FACE Technical Standard and software tools, to move AEGIS interface and data model specifications forward by specifying semantic representations, allow interoperability issues to be discovered earlier, and promote reuse by isolating code changes within the architecture. This will facilitate the introduction of new capability while allowing legacy subsystems to operate without change and migrate forward to FACE conformance as their Program allows. All of this will combine to reduce the effort and cost associated with developing, integrating, testing, and certifying tactical software."

VIStology proposes to develop a Semantic data Architecture for Future-proof Extensible integration (SAFE) approach that will leverage semantic technologies to allow adding and maintaining new components at runtime without affecting the legacy systems. Proposed semantically-rich protocols facilitate automating reasoning about the legacy and new components, which will make systems gracefully handle the addition of new components and data attributes, and to avoid undesirable side effects. Effectively, SAFE will enable capability upgrades at any time, regardless of the software version of the systems and components present on a ship. Instead of replacing entire software suite, individual modules of the combat management system can be deployed one at a time. To test the proposed approach, VIStology will work closely with its partner, which already provided a concrete use case that would drive the R&amp;D effort in Phase I, but also be used to assess usability, correctness and efficiency of SAFE. This collaboration will guarantee that any product developed out of this effort will address real needs of its potential users, and that SAFE improves the efficiency and the quality of the acquisition of DoD systems."

        "abstract": "Traditional integration approaches include numerous hand-generated and maintained mediation gateways, bridges, and interface adapters. Each integration evolution requires a full evaluation of every interface in every system, introducing errors resulting from incomplete understanding of data and its semantics. This traditional process yields brittle and incomplete integration solutions, inadequately tested software prone to error, and most significantly, one-off integration efforts with every system modification. This proposal leverages Skayls first generation sematic-aware integration compiler, and seeks to research, test and quantify further developments to this technology including the development of techniques for real-time signal and state management. This innovation will provide a more efficient and more cost-effective integration solution that can be dynamically reconfigured as requirements, systems, and interfaces (and even as real-time operational conditions) change. During the SBIR, Skayl will identify fundamental concepts relating to signals, state and behavior as related to the needs of combat systems and formally document them in a data model. Skayl will then develop metrics &amp; approaches for testing real-time integration in order to provide quantitative results of increases in efficiency as well as identifying areas for further development and improvement."

These developments to date have been targeted in the mid-wave infrared (MWIR), however with ever increasing threat sophistication there is a real need to expand the wavelength regime of these countermeasures to more diverse wavelengths, in particular the long-wave infrared (LWIR). Forward Photonics has had remarkable success using its proprietary wavelength beam combination (WBC) technology in the mid-infrared regime (45 m) with QCLs. Forward Photonics mid-wave infrared (MWIR) laser capable of producing &gt; 25 W in CW operation by using WBC to combine the outputs of individual high power QCLs. Forward Photonics is proposing a technical approach to construct a 100 W LWIR system based on WBC of high power QCLs."

The system is composed of multiple quantum cascade laser modules which are spectrally combined into a single output beam. In order to simplify system construction, the system is designed to operate with a small number of active elements engineered for high atmospheric transmission. This is made possible by the use of already demonstrated high efficiency quantum cascade wafer designs and a new, on-chip phase-locking architecture to significantly scale the output power per module. The proposed effort will both experimentally demonstrate a proof-of-concept laser module and explore initial system design for broadband spectral coverage"

These strategizes will determine the number of interceptors to be launched, their launch times, which threats they will engage, and will coordinate their flight paths to enhance lethality, avoid debris, and lower cost. This algorithm will be developed using a two-tiered approach. First create a large database of optimized PIPs spanning many different threat scenarios by using global optimization. Second use this database to train a neural network to create optimized PIPs in real time.

According to the SBIR description, detailed interface requirements between craft and launch and recovery systems are not established to prevent craft damage. MAPC will design a concept ABLARS which consists of a main ramp, extendable ramp, and a capture carriage. The main ramp runs the length of the boat bay and is installed parallel to the boat bay deck. The main ramp features keel rollers similar to those found on a commercial boat trailer along the centerline, and bunks on either side of centerline installed on pivoting arms."

Termed ADAM, for Autonomous Damage Assessment Module,&apos; ADAM will measure and store RF emissions from a targeted facility, record critical parameters of an HPRF engagement source, measure target RF emissions after the HPRF engagement, determine if significant changes in the RF signature have occurred, and finally transmit all of these results to a command authority within seconds to minutes after engagement. ADAM is made possible by the rapid advances and reduced costs of Personal Computer (PC) controlled spectrum analyzers and Software Defined Radio (SDR) transceivers and will have a footprint on the order of a square foot or less. ADAMs small footprint and low cost will allow deployment of multiple units close to a target facility by overt or covert means."

        "abstract": "Mentoring, demonstrating, and over-the-shoulder performance checks are some of the ways experienced Sailors pass their knowledge to newer Sailors, thereby furthering their growth. These methods are effective for passing knowledge to a particular Sailor or group, but are less effective for ensuring all Sailors have the knowledge, resources, and training they need when they need them. The effective reach and impact of these on-the-job knowledge sharing methods could be vastly increased by capturing experts knowledge in real time, as its being shared, and making it available for mass consumption and benefit. Technologies for achieving this capability exist; the challenges are adapting and integrating those technologies to support high quality, easily captured, and easily consumed knowledge products. To address these challenges, SoarTech proposes the tablet-based Proficiency Amplified through Knowledge Sharing and Support for Informal Teaching (PASSIT) tool for on-the-job, high-quality multi-media expert-knowledge capture. PASSIT will support on-the-job knowledge capture and sharing across a wide range of operations and maintenance work communities. In this Phase I effort, we will design an initial prototype based on the knowledge sharing needs and practices of two work communities, the Sonar Technician Surface (STG) and petroleum processing industries."

Sonalysts solution, the Peer-to-Peer Information and Education Resource (PIER), will increase warfighter effectiveness by providing sailors with the opportunity to learn from each other via a simple app-like authoring tool. PIER will allow the Navy to increase the distribution of tacit knowledge resident throughout the fleet and thereby capitalize on the collective intelligence of its men and women. PIER will be a highly usable wizard-like authoring system that will allow Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) to quickly, efficiently, and effectively develop a variety of performance supports. The PIER architecture will be designed to function on a range of traditional and mobile computing platforms. Robust design patterns will allow SMEs to document their lessons learned via specified knowledge-transfer documents. The PIER system will help SMEs to identify an appropriate job aid and then lead the SME through a documentation process. Bootstrapping questions and an analysis of the content will be used to define metadata tags and the information product will be placed in a temporary local data store. The chain of command can use vetting tools to assess the product and authorize its release."

S2S will be designed based on knowledge gained through interactions with potential users, lessons learned and best practice in the knowledge creation domain, and findings within the training and cognitive science literature. The S2S user interface design will be guided by human factors principles, ensuring that it is effective, easy to understand, and use.Once developed, S2S will be a powerful, usable web application for sailors to rapidly capture and share practical, hands-on, operationally-relevant knowledge with fellow sailors. S2S will invigorate Navy training by augmenting the more traditional schoolhouse and on the job training activities with highly specific video content created by sailors for sailors. Traditional formal and informal training support the development of needed, valuable knowledge, but is often limited in terms of accessibility and currency of content. Furthermore, invaluable location- and context-specific knowledge held by sailors is not being captured and disseminated efficiently and effectively.S2S will change the way sailors share and consume knowledge. Ultimately, greater knowledge dissemination will lead to improved collaboration and performance, and reduced inefficiencies around the Fleet."

Addressing this limitation, Dynamic Dimension Technologies (DDT), proposes to create the Water incorporated and Autonomy enabled Virtual Environment (WAVE) to accurately represent the multi-domain environmental states which influences amphibious vehicle motions. Based on lessons learned from a decade of developing M&amp;S for autonomous ground vehicle testing, DDT will design and develop a novel open architecture simulation framework which embraces naturalistic multi-domain environments required for amphibious autonomy systems evaluations. During Phase I, DDT will define an innovative methodology and modeling architecture that supports simulating full 6 degree-of-freedom, multibody dynamics for amphibious vehicles. These models will represent the full vehicle system with articulating components, hull form geometry, tires\/tracks, suspension, brakes, steering, engine, propulsion, etc., and interactions with the water, terrain and air. WAVE will include communications models for scenarios such as remote operations, formation maneuvers, swarming, teaming, etc., and sensor models (i.e. GPS, IMU, EO\/IR, RF, Sonar, etc.) for autonomy algorithms such as perception, world model, decision making and route planning."

        "abstract": "It has been recognized for over a decade that robotic and autonomous systems will become a major component of the US military warfighting capability. In working to create flexible, robust robotic capabilities, engineers have found that developing and testing these systems carry unique challenges that arent easily solved through the application of traditional engineering tools and processes. One area that has great potential, however, to enhance robustness, reduce costs, and shorten development time is the application of engineering modeling and simulation (M&amp;S). In this program, QS proposes to create ANVEL Coastal: Autonomous System Simulation Tool for Land\/Sea Systems. ANVEL Coastal will be a multi-domain engineering M&amp;S tool specifically built to support the development, testing, and validation of robotic systems that operate in land, sea, or in the transition between them. The system will build upon an existing ground-focused autonomous system M&amp;S tool, Autonomous Navigation Virtual Environment Laboratory (ANVEL), which is widely used by the DoD and other organizations in its ground robotics efforts. ANVEL Coastal will provide a desktop simulation capability that can be adapted and used in a variety of configurations to support development and testing of autonomous sea\/land\/transitional systems."

        "abstract": "Increased performance requirements of high-power or high-frequency electronics require novel thermal management materials. Boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) enhance performance of polymer-based electrically-insulating thermal interface materials (TIMs). This work will incorporate BNNTs into common micro-particle polymer composites to increase thermal transport between particles. Thermal impedance within TIMs is dominated by resistivity of the polymer which holds the thermally-conductive particles together in the matrix. Typically, inter-particulate space is 20% of interfaces volume. A multi-scale, bottoms-up approach to fabricating the filler material is expected to increase the thermal conductivity of many TIMs to above 10 W\/mK. TIMs based on epoxy, cyanoacrylate, silicone, silicone oil, nylon multipolymer thermoplastic, and polytetrafluoroethylene matrices will be explored. Preliminary in-house work already dramatically increased thermal conductivity to nearly 6 W\/mK in thermoplastics doped with BNNTs, implying an increase in inter-particle conductivity of ~20X. The TIMs produced in this study will be characterized for in- and through-plane thermal conductivity, and filler material development will be aided by scanning electron microscope imaging and surface area analysis of the densified powders to determine optimal ratios of components. The TIMs fabricated will be applicable within components, and as adhesives, pastes, top-side coatings, substrates, underfills, gap fillers, gap pads, and laminates."

        "abstract": "Electronic devices in general, and high power, high-speed electronics in particular, generate substantial amounts of heat that must be removed in order for the device to continue to function. Finned metal blocks and heat pipes assist in removing the heat from individual components and circuit boards. Soft, possibly adhesive elastomers help fill the small gaps between the component packaging and the heat sink, thereby greatly improving the quality of the interface through which heat can flow. Since the thermal conductivity of elastomers is rather poor, they are filled with fine particles of a good thermal conductor. Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has long been a material of choice for the filler, since it combines outstanding thermal conductivity with a low dielectric constant. Recently, polymers with small, exfoliated BN sheets have demonstrated tremendous increases in thermal conductivity, primarily due to improved alignment of the hBN in the direction of the heat flow. However, the reported methods of alignment are often not practicable in a manufacturing context, and the polymers are not generally suitable for thermal interface materials (TIMs). TDA will address these issues with a low-cost manufacturing process built around polymers that have long found to be satisfactory for TIMs."

The proposed materials will improve both performance and efficiency, prolong lifetime, and reduce lifecycle costs with enhanced thermal conductivity while remaining electrically insulating. During the Phase I program, UDC will formulate thermally conductive formulations and compare these with currently used commercial materials for electronic packaging characteristic, application method, cure temperature and time. The developed formulations will be tested for thermal conductance, electrical insulation, resistance to vibration\/abrasion, conformance to irregular gaps, and manufacturing cost. Additional tests will include coefficient of thermal expansion, rheological behavior and fabrication\/operational temperatures (+120C to 200C), and elevated humidity conditions in accordance with military specifications and ASTM standards. A report with results and conclusions will be submitted at the end of the program"

        "abstract": "Automated planners have been adopted as key decision support tools for mission planning in a wide range of domains, such as maritime Mine CounterMeasures (MCM). However, the models that power these planners, such as models of capabilities, tactics, environment, and goals, must currently be hand-codeda tedious and slow process that makes model maintenance impractical for highly dynamic domains where models must be constantly updated. Further, the hand-coding approach does not scale to scenarios with increasing numbers of heterogeneous unmanned assets, such as unmanned underwater vehicles, where their sensing and autonomous capabilities can vary widely and change far more rapidly than larger manned systems. In these scenarios, MCM operators cannot rely on automated planners to have adequate knowledge of assets and how best to tactically employ them because the rate at which this knowledge can be hand-coded is insufficient to keep up with the tempo of change. These limitations ultimately result in suboptimal mission performance and underutilization of unmanned assets. To overcome these challenges, the SoarTech team proposes MineApprentice, a machine learning system that incrementally and continually acquires both asset performance models and tactical planning knowledge from interaction with operators as they use existing MCM planning software (e.g., MEDAL-EA\/MineNet Tactical)."

These issues can adversely impact the quality and the effectiveness of support offered by automated software. However, manual maintenance of models planning domain is slow, expensive and error prone. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) present an opportunity to address this problem by automatically acquiring, enriching and updating asset performance models and tactical planning knowledge for use by automated mission software. We will develop CILEMP, a software system comprising Continuous Interactive Learners for Mission Planning. CILEMP shall utilize a family of numeric and symbolic learning approaches to learn from subject matter experts(SMEs) inputs they provide during practice planning sessions and during real operations. We will investigate ML approaches such as learning from demonstration and learning from experience to acquire and update model parameters, planning preferences, and higher order structures for tactics to improve model coverage, precision, accuracy and efficiency. We will work with SMEs to develop scenarios for evaluating the feasibility of CILEMP. We will develop a software architecture specification and prototype implementation plan for Phase II."

        "abstract": "The current exponential growth of energy consumption in supercomputers and data centers has become an ecological and economical problem for simple reasons of power delivery, power dissipation and heat removal. To go on with the exponential growth in the use of information we need to continue reducing the energy required to handle each bit. This reduction, however, becomes an increasingly harder problem. We propose a new strategy for the more efficient cooling of electronics, where cooling is achieved through efficient anti-Stokes spontaneous emission from quantum dots and low-dimensional structures embedded into a waveguide structure and excited by external laser emission. The physical mechanism is that of laser cooling and requires quantum dots with very efficient anti-Stokes emission. Various designs of the cooling device are explored to find the most efficient way for spontaneous emission extraction to prevent reabsorption and reheating in electronics. The geometry of a single device allows the fabrication of a planar structure for cooling 3D stacks of electronics, where power dissipation and heat removal becomes the most severe problem for the difficulty in designing effective heat sinks. The concept provides a means for implementation of such heat sinks as cooling planes compatible with 3D stacks of electronics."

Only a laser is used to pump in light; a semiconducting material upconverts this energy to reject higher energy photons producing a net cooling effect. Optical cooling is contrasted by mechanical systems, such as Stirling cryocoolers which can be loud, prone to vibration, and rapidly decrease in efficiency with thermal lift. Optical cooling may also be able to scale to the thermal load as the cooling power is linearly proportional to the laser power. And unlike thermoelectric Peltier coolers, optical coolers may be able to achieve temperatures of &lt; 10 K.Mainstream will overcome poor efficiencies of conventionally optical coolers by improving each of the components of the optical cooling device to improve the quantum yield, film integration, and emitted photon rejection. In Phase I, Mainstream will demonstrate the viability of optical cooling via quantum dot anti-Stokes upconversion to generate net cooling. In Phase II, the integration of the optical cooler with a specified device will be designed, fabricated, and tested leading to immediate commercialization."

        "abstract": "The Navy needs a multi-dimensional ambient noise model (MDAMN) which can account for the characteristics of noise due to wind, wave action, rain and shipping as a function of time, direction and location over a broad range of tactical frequencies and operational environments. Metron proposes to build an MDANM tool that aims to maximally leverage all available information sources and computes the directional noise field and associated array gain in an accurate and efficient manner. One of the key differentiators of the proposed product is its ability to adaptively adjust the underlying physics models and input data sources based on the use case parameters to provide proper tradeoff between speed and accuracy. A second differentiator is the combined use of Monte Carlo methods with real time shipping information to improve shipping noise estimates. The framework components of MDANM will be based on feedback from stakeholders and end-users for output to the next-generation Submarine Tactical Decision Aid (STDA). Enhancing the reliability and accuracy of detection modeling will lead to an increase the utility of TDAs, and allow operators to make better strategic and\/or tactical recommendations."

The Phase I effort will (1) develop a framework for MDANM and analyze and specify sonar and other data requirements necessary to develop and support MDANM; (2) establish that MDANM can feasibly meet Navy needs by detailing the proposed techniques to be used to estimate key MDANM parameters and strategies for how the data required to estimate the parameters can be obtained operationally; and (3) establish that MDANM can be developed into a useful product for the Navy by identifying the architecture, protocols, and formats for MDANM interface with and output to the next-generation STDA and other sonar TDAs developed by Naval Surface Warfare Center Carderock Division (NSWCCD) using the same common baseline."

We will demonstrate proof-of-concept simulation components that have the capability to pit smart red\/gray forces against smart blue forces to aid development of timely and effective decision support tools. This proposed capability will provide a service that is available for decision support tools to suggest modifications to current plans and predict future outcomes contextualized to a specific situation. Our demonstration scenario will be a lab-based 3-on-3 game in which both the red\/gray commander and blue commander have three platoons with an objective of securing an area of interest. To increase our understanding, we will vary the parameters of the game to explore the differences in strategies. For example, the differences between an amphibious operation to secure a beachhead as opposed to one in a dense, urban environment to secure critical infrastructure. The Phase I results will demonstrate the feasibility of the approach for an operationally relevant toolset and decision support instrument. The Phase I results will also identify metrics to verify performance, and model normalization across simulation systems necessary to reduce technical risk."

        "abstract": "Modern hearing protection devices (HPDs) often include electronic hear-through technology that helps to preserve or enhance the users auditory situational awareness (ASA). Restoration of ASA has removed one of the largest barriers to HPD adoption. However, because HPDs alter the shape of the ear or ear canal, they distort the acoustic cues used by the brain to localize the source of a sound. Thus, there is a need to both measure the effect HPDs have on sound localization and to train HPD users to localize sounds while wearing their HPDs. However, current sound localization systems are essentially fixed installations that are expensive to set up and difficult use. A new, portable, and inexpensive measurement-training system is needed. Creare proposes to develop an Auditory Situational Awareness Station (ASA Station) that combines innovative sound projection technologies and user interfaces to maximize training effectiveness and efficiency in a lightweight, easy-to-use, and portable package. In the Phase I Base we will demonstrate the core ASA Station innovations in a proof-of-concept system. In Phase II, we will develop a complete prototype solution covering the full range operational specifications."

PASAT, using a menu-based computer interface, will enable user-friendly setup, calibration, and operation by either trainer or trainee, and provide performance feedback during training exercises on accuracy and response time metrics. Using custom LabVIEW software, training will be enabled with both open ear and various HPDs and TCAPS, with on-screen comparison of results. A computerized automatic gain control innovation will maintain one of at least 3 preselected signal\/masking-noise ratios sufficiently above ambient noise encountered in training environments. Options for various military-relevant, pre-calibrated WAV files of signals and noises will be selectable by the trainer\/trainee. PASAT will include a 15-degree arcuate separation between signal speakers in azimuth\/elevation, with speaker array mounted on a collapsible, portable halo-style frame. Phase I includes a subcontract to Virginia Tech&apos;s Auditory Systems Lab to enable its full-scale DRILCOM ASA test system to be used as a springboard resource. The Principal Investigators have extensive experience with ASA testing\/training, having pioneered objective measurement of ASA performance in 2007, and thereafter developed instrumentation\/protocols for its laboratory measurement and trainee skills acquisition."

        "abstract": "The research objective of the proposed work is to develop a concept for a feed-forward control (FFC) hardware, algorithms, and multi-physics-based models to allow real-time tracking of powder bed layer variability and corresponding laser processing parameter compensation to improve the quality of laser fusion-based metal additive manufacturing (AM) parts. The FFC concept is designed to compensate for the systematic physical property variabilities of the powder bed layer arising from the non-uniformity of thermal evolution for the AM build and recoat layer powder. This includes the characterization of systematic layer thickness variability that is caused by splatter, molten particle ejects, denudation zones, and the previous layer surface roughness. The proposed FFC compensation algorithms build upon the predictions of multi-physics models in order to minimize defects and the non-uniformity of microstructure, which arise from the inconsistency of the melt-pool shape and its solidification behavior. The parameter compensation is designed to predict the current, relevant information using off-the-shelf hardware and data-reduction procedures that have been demonstrated. The Phase I will refine these procedures and the hardware utilization for real-time FFC application. It will also specify a range of parameter variables for the purpose of model development, system verification, and technology validation."

        "abstract": "To address the Navy need for cross-domain transition goggles with an integrated, illuminated display, Intellisense Systems, Inc. (ISS) proposes to develop new Transition Wide-Angle Goggles with Integrated Illuminated Display (TWIGIID) based on an innovative design that uniquely integrates an ellipsoidal visor with narrowband reflective coating, free-form anamorphic plastic-molded optics, and high-resolution miniature OLED microdisplays. The use of ellipsoidal reflectors provides wide field-of-view (FOV) distortion-free collimation; anamorphic optics to stretch and reconfigure the OLED image into 3-times higher horizontal resolution; and free-form surface design to correct the geometrical distortion over the wide FOV. The use of ellipsoidal visor lens and miniaturized projection optics enables the size of lap swim goggles. Water-proof sealing of microdisplay and electronics allows seamless transition between underwater and above-water operation. Use of a passive coating and purging with dry gas enables the small goggles to be cleared if flooded with water, to equalize pressure as needed, and to be fog-free. In Phase I, ISS will develop a detailed design of TWIGIID, analyze performance, and specify procedure and hardware for water clearing, equalizing, and de-fogging. In Phase II, ISS will fabricate, lab test, evaluate form-fit and function, revise design, and fabricate prototypes based on Navys feedback."

        "abstract": "Current military dive masks are relatively bulky and do not function well with night vision equipment or weapons because of a large forward projection from the face. The additional size and complications of an integrated display for situational awareness and augmented reality exacerbates these problems. A versatile, compact and easy to stow goggle system with an integrated illuminated display that can function effectively in all aspects of air-sea-land operations would have immediate advantages but also poses serious design challenges. Creative Microsystems Corporation (CMC) proposes to design, develop and transition the Cross-Domain Integrated Goggle (CDIG) to answer this challenge. CMC will leverage its existing technology and experience in wearable displays, near to eye displays and dive equipment development to bring to the Navy a new approach to eye\/face covering that can do all these jobs well. The proposed design can be particularly cost effective and weight reducing by replacing four or more pieces of special operator or Navy combat diver equipment. Commercial applications of the resulting design phase and its implementation can enable a wide range of swimming, scuba diving, industrial safety and first responder products that incorporate a display function."

        "abstract": "The U.S. Navy has a strong need to reduce the Radar Cross Section (RCS) of submarine masts such as the OE-538 in order to maintain stealth during high data rate communications. The submarine mast RCS is compounded by multi-path off the sea which tends to cause increased and persistent back-scattering over a wide range of aspect angles and frequencies. To avoid the high cost of reshaping the mast, the only viable technique to reduce the RCS is to utilize radio frequency (RF) absorber. The RF absorber needs to be judiciously applied to avoid degrading the communication signals while reducing the RCS. Toyon proposes to evaluate the feasibility of its patterned absorber for application in reducing the RCS of the Navy&apos;s submarine masts. Toyons patterned absorber can be applied like wall-paper and covered with a protective layer to withstand the harsh operating environment of a submarine mast. The thin patterned circuit layer consists of passive resistive and conductive elements that can be readily varied over a surface (i.e. tuned during manufacturing) using standard circuit board etching techniques. Toyon will use proven computer models to design absorbers specific to this application and then validate the predictions by testing a prototype."

        "abstract": "US Navy submarines use metallic masts such as Lockheeds OE-538\/BRC Multifunction Communication Mast Antenna System to communicate. Although these are highly effective, a main drawback to their use is that they can be detected by enemy radar. A prospective solution would be the application of material over existing masts that can be tuned to keep any desired band open for communication while maximally absorbing all other frequencies. This material must be environmentally stable to temperature\/pressure changes, salt corrosion, and humidity. Additionally, since the mast assembly cannot be removed, the coating\/material must be applied on the submarine. Luna proposes a multilayer adhesive appliqu, with different sheets tuned to specific open frequency bands. The individual layers will contain tunable fillers and\/or structures to maximally absorb unwanted frequencies while retaining the desired frequency band open. With slight modification to the formulation, the appliqu can be tuned to different open frequency bands. Protective coatings will be applied to the sheets to achieve desired marine environmental protection. For the Phase I program Luna will combine experimental simulations, material synthesis, and radar cross-section\/absorption testing, with the primary goal of demonstrating feasibility of tuning performance to the open frequency bands."

POC interference mitigation innovations built into HAWAII include: tunable filters and predistortion to linearize the amplifier and reduce intermodulation interference, and an interference canceller to provide simultaneous transmit and receive (STAR) capability. As a result, this system supports hopping and multi-carrier waveforms across the entire HF\/VHF\/UHF bands, which directly addresses the PMW\/A-170 requirements for integration with the Digital Modular Radio (DMR) and the High Frequency Over-the-Horizon (HFORCE) waveform. In Phase I, POC will demonstrate the feasibility of HAWAII, designing and developing a concept architecture to address high individual carrier power variations and mitigate the resulting intermodulation interference, reaching technology readiness level (TRL) 3. In Phase II, POC plans to develop and demonstrate a prototype system reaching TRL-5."

        "abstract": "In response to the N181-088 SBIR solicitation (&quot;High Dynamic Range Multi-Carrier Amplifier&quot;), MaXentric proposes EMBARC (Efficient Multi-carrier Broadband Amplifier for Radio Communication) to overcome the challenges of multi-carrier, multi-channel amplification. EMBARC supports up to 36 concurrent carriers from with 100W of output power for VHF and UHF systems (2MHz - 3 GHz). Due to the nature of multi-carrier signals (high peak to average power), EMBARC utilizes intelligent supply management as well as Adagio (multi-carrier enabler) coupled with GreenAmp envelope tracking to provide the highest efficiency, keeping the overall SWaP to a minimum. High linearity is achieved with our real-time predistorter MaXPAL. In addition, EMBARC integrates a coupler system to enable future-leaning STaR platforms. To enable smooth integration with existing and future platforms, EMBARC is designed to interface with the digital modular radios (DMR). In Phase I, the analysis and design of EMBARC will be performed through simulations along with relevant trade studies. The effort includes a feasibility demonstration of EMBARC. Phase II efforts involve the implementation, fabrication, and system integration of EMBARC, resulting in a hardware prototype-based design methodology and findings of Phase I."

The communications payload can communicate with existing and future tactical radios and pass HAIPE encrypted data to the host commercial SATCOM system to be relayed to the appropriate MOC where it can be decrypted, and an encrypted response be sent back through the HAIPE encrypted commercial SATCOM system and then back through the Vulcan NSR SDR to the appropriate tactical radio. There are a wide range of waveforms are possible for the NSR system to host. For example; MIL-STD-188-181B, MIL-STD-188-165A, Link-22, Link-16, Adaptive Networking Wide bandwidth Waveform (ANW2), Wideband Networking Waveform (WNW), P25 (Project 25), Protected Tactical Waveform (PTW), Solder Radio Waveform (SRW) and Common Data Link (CDL)."

The payload is envisioned as a modular system that can be added to commercial satellites in Low Earth Orbit (LEO), extending Navys communication systems. Military assets would send\/receive data through the host satellites gateway link, where SR-ATP would exchange this data through its interface with the host. From there, SR-ATP would modulate\/demodulate the data using a selected military waveform and transmit\/receive the data through its RF front-end module (FEM) and the antenna. In this design, each tactical payload is composed of a common processing module and one or more FEMs and the antennas. The common module has an FPGA-based communication processor, Ethernet connection, memory, and a power conditioning unit. For the FEMs, Cesium will develop two RF personalities, one for UHF operations and one for L-band operations. In addition, Cesium will develop a payload bus that would support the modular payload and allow for a variety of integration options with the host satellite. Using the core module, one or more bus units, and one or more RF personalities, Navy would be able to quickly assemble payloads of various complexities and integrate them on a host satellite."

The integrated architecture will combine capabilities resident in the Mobile Device (and operating system), Mobile Device Management (MDM) \/ Enterprise Mobility Management (EMM), IoT Technologies, Data Ingestion and Normalization, Device Virtualization, and Mobile Deceive Detection and Localization technologies to provide an end-to-end system. The proposed architecture will leverage open standards and open source technologies where possible. In cases that proprietary technologies will be used, SOLUTE will develop abstraction layers and Open APIs to ensure that the resulting system is vendor neutral. In addition, the IMU based motion prediction algorithms developed in the previous phase will be improved and productionized. Finally, GML based Smart Maps will be implemented to add context and intelligence to all motion and location prediction inputs. All location sensing system will be thoroughly tested to build real world error and accuracy models. Much like other forms of sensor fusion, these models will be used to more accurately predict location information by aggregating and fusing information from all available sensor data."

JENTEKs lower-cost, 7-channel jET handheld impedance instrument will be the primary platform for which corrosion and crack detection inspections will be developed. JENTEK will support the Navys efforts to validate and verify the performance by providing capability demonstrations, jET systems with appropriate end effectors and sensors, and training. A successful program will ready the technology for near term transition to the fleet."

SDIs software will be provided to NAVAIR at the outset of this project, and SDI will assist in a technical review of NAVAIRs analysis software. Through collaboration with NAVAIR, the capabilities of both sets of software will be extended to handle multiple types of hose, drogue, probe and reeling mechanisms. Additional detailed modeling will be conducted for the engagement mechanism. Validation of the software will be carried out with data provided by NAVAIR, including data obtained through recent flight testing. SDI will use the developed software tools for predictive modeling of F-18 and JSF probe loads, perform additional modeling and validation for the engagement\/contact of the probe and drogue, and develop the ability to interface with the Navys CASTLE software."

The primary emphasis of this effort is the development of the acoustic array and its associated data handling and telemetry electronics to provide a capable acoustic ASW sensor system that will deliver useful target detection information to the war fighter. The sensor array will be integrated into a full sonobuoy system, which will include the suspension and telemetry cable, the surface float, and batteries. The system will be developed throughout with full consideration of the A-size packaging constraints. Prototype over-the-side units will be fabricated and tested to demonstrate the system performance."

        "abstract": "The Navy continues to incur very high costs and lost service time due to unanticipated maintenance and repair or replacement of unreliable outboard sonar and other hardware on submarines, surface ships, minehunting systems and towed arrays. TRI\/Austin will develop innovative new primer and potting compound materials to reduce water permeation, mitigate cathodic delamination failures, and to eliminate many hazardous materials. In addition to the development of these new second generation encapsulants for underwater connectors, improved and highly predictive ALT (accelerated life testing) procedures are required to certify long-term durability. Current PRO 20 approved products for the priming and potting of underwater electrical connectors and other components were developed many years ago. The original encapsulant materials were developed under specification (MIL-M-24041) which was written in 1971. Many of the originally developed primers contain hexavalent chromium (strontium chromate or zinc chromate) moreover; they also contain volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and hazardous air pollutants (HAPS). In addition, some of these polyurethane potting compounds contain ingredients, such as toluene diisocyanate (TDI) or 4,4&apos;-methylene-bis (2-chloroaniline) (MOCA), which are potential carcinogens. Recently a new promising ALT procedure was developed at NUWC and its verification will be the subject of a round-robin study in the proposed effort."

A wide band response from below 2 kHz to over 9 kHz was measured and FEA results showed no significant stress in the single crystal material for a hydrostatic pressure of 1,000 psi. During the proposed Phase II a partial array of improved pressure tolerant d36 shear mode transducers will be developed. To this end, and before the array development, an optimized, improved, pressure-tolerant d36 single crystal version would be FEA modeled, fabricated and tested in-air and in-water under low and high pressures."

        "abstract": "Despite continual increases in battery energy density, unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) design and mission capabilities continue to be strongly influenced by onboard energy storage limitations. Primary and rechargeable lithium-chemistry batteries constrain operational endurance, require high initial investment and significant ongoing operations and maintenance costs, and are associated with both safety hazards and negative environmental impacts. Environmental energy harvesting provides a means to transcend the limitations of onboard energy storage, maximize operational flexibility and safety, and enable underwater platforms and vehicles to contribute their full potential to the Navys mission. The objective of this Phase II effort is to design, characterize, and prototype novel ocean thermal energy harvesting systems with the potential to support tactical and persistent UUV operations (e.g. oceanography, MCM, CN3, and ISR missions). Two distinct design concepts will be considered: Cyclic systems suitable as integrated onboard UUV power subsystems, and continuous systems suitable for moored or mobile power stations for UUV recharging or persistent underwater sensor or communication networks. The performance of these systems will be quantitatively assessed, first in a laboratory environment and then in the ocean, with specific emphasis on their ability to exploit the minimal and\/or variable environmental temperature differentials relevant to global naval operations."

This device is based on specific type of liquid crystal technologies and expected performance is not only wide beam steering, but also fast enough steering without using any mechanical moving parts. Unlike typical liquid crystal based technologies, this particular technology would enable polarization free beam steering. This gives more light throughput efficiency. Although most of liquid crystal technologies require single linearly polarized light switching, newly developing liquid crystal driving mode technology would enable up to 90% use of incident non-polarized light. This project includes couple of challenging technical development such as polarization-free switching, fast enough optical response (~ 1 ms) and wide enough beam steering. Fast optical response will be realized by i-CORE&apos;s specific liquid crystal material technologies, and wide beams steering will be realized by large spatial distribution of liquid crystal refractive indices in conjunction with specific integrated liquid crystal panel design such as fine pitch patterned electrode structures, and\/or blazed grating structures."

        "abstract": "Luna, teamed with the University of Texas - Arlington, is proposing to continue developing a miniaturized, low power system that detects imminent battery failure based on High Definition Fiber Optic Sensing (HD-FOS) technology. This system is designed to identify thermal runaways caused by internal faults that initiates an uncontrolled feedback loop resulting in overheating, fire, or explosion. When detected early, warnings can be transmitted and corrective action taken to save the vessel. The technology being implemented allows for a single, low cost, fiber optic sensor to be routed around and within cell and cell packs. With a spatial resolution of 5mm along its entire length and a millisecond response time, the sensor will immediately detect a thermal event. The sensor suite will be interrogated with a ruggedized miniaturized controller that relays warnings to a remote alarm panel. During Phase I, Luna demonstrated feasibility across a range of battery sizes. During Phase II, Luna will optimize the sensor placement and triggering algorithms, develop a prototype that satisfies the size, weight, and power envelope, and demonstrate accurate fault detection with repeated actual battery charge-discharge schemes. The Phase III effort will support the Navy in transitioning the technology to Advanced Undersea Systems use."

When a fault occurs, the Li battery can release toxic and flammable gases which can start and feed a fire, cause significant equipment damage, and present catastrophic hazards to personnel safety. Early signals of a battery issue can occur internally. If detected early, the system can provide critical warnings of cell issues before they evolve into more hazardous problems. This proposal concerns the development of a early warning fault indication system for lithium batteries. The proposed system allows for extensive monitoring of individual cells at high speed in real-time. It will provide monitoring at the cell level of key precursors of battery fault, triggering an alarm when a precursor is detected, and identifying the cell having issues. During Phase I, feasibility of the device was demonstrated by exposure to repeated simulated ambient battery environmental conditions. During Phase II, a prototype will be developed, fabricated, tested, and deliver to the Navy."

Passive remote sensing of profiles, structure, and gradients of refractivity, temperature, and water vapor in the troposphere can be obtained through observations. The methodology proposed herein is a new approach and utilizes both methods in heretofore unused infrared observations to maximize independent measurements and therefore skill, in obtaining said tropospheric structures. The system is capable of a very rapid, 30 Hz, frame rate of over 300,000 pixels of 0.04C infrared temperature resolution. This information is inverted mathematically into tropospheric structure. The profile information obtained can be utilized to model the refractivity environment in all EM wavebands, from low frequency radio through ultraviolet."

        "abstract": "There is an ongoing need to improve the design of low frequency, high power sonar transducers for use in underwater acoustic applications. During this Phase I Base Program, the Massa\/BAE Team investigated the properties of recently developed PMN-PT textured ceramics for transduction use in transducers, and then developed designs for two different PMN-PT transducers that were based on existing PZT-8 transducers to evaluate the potential improvements. The first design was a Class III Flextensional (Barrel Stave) Transducer that operated over the frequency range of 0.8 to 1.2 kHz. The textured transducer design produced an increase in maximum Source Level of 5 dB above the same sized PZT-8 transducer over the entire bandwidth. The second design was a lightweight direct mechanical and electroacoustic replacement for the PZT-8 Tonpilz TR-353 Transducers used in the projector portion of the LAB Array on Virginia Class Submarines. The textured transducer design produced the same resonant frequency and TVR at resonance as the PZT-8 TR-353, and a higher TVR over the operating bandwidth. A production design of this version of the TR-353 Transducer will reduce the weight of the Lab Array on each Virginia Class Submarine by almost 2000 lbs."

        "abstract": "To address the Navys need for a non-aqueous, environmentally benign, surface preparation process for pre-treatment of aluminum, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to continue development of the new Active-Feedback Laser Surface Preparation (AFLAP) system. This proposed surface processing system is based on pulsed laser ablation and novel use of real-time surface quality monitoring with plasma emission spectroscopy. Specifically, the innovation in making treated surface quality information available during preparation will enable preparation of aluminum alloy surfaces with homogenous topography and a high level of purity. During Phase I, POC successfully demonstrated the feasibility of the AFLAP system through design and development of a benchtop prototype and by conducting proof-of-concept experiments. Comparison of the wettability, metallurgical, and corrosion resistance coating adhesion test results proved that the AFLAP pre-treatment process is better than- or on par with the immersion tank process. Having fully demonstrated the feasibility of the technology, POC plans to develop a complete prototype with a fully developed ablation head and laser system and demonstrate its performance through laboratory bench level tests as well as field level tests at a Navy repair and rework facility. The proposed system is expected to reach TRL-6 at the end of Phase II."

        "abstract": "Superconducting radio-frequency receivers, optical absorption energy sensors, and quantum computers have the potential to revolutionize digital communications for manned aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles, (UAVs) and satellites. Development of low size, weight, power, and cost (SWaP-C) cryocooler technology is essential since these communication systems must operate at cryogenic temperatures. Turbo-Brayton cryocoolers, which have high performance at low temperatures, are attractive for providing low-temperature cooling in these applications. For these cryocoolers, high-performance recuperators are needed to transfer heat between the high- and low-pressure gas streams to reduce the required cryocooler input power and provide cooling at the low operating temperatures of the communication device components. The SWaP-C of the cryocooler is highly dependent on the recuperator characteristics. We propose to develop a compact, lightweight, and low-cost recuperator focusing on the temperature range between 4 K and 25 K. In Phase I, we sized the recuperator core components through thermal performance analysis, performed fabrication trials for key features and processes, and assessed manufacturing costs. In Phase II, we propose to advance the low SWaP-C recuperator fabrication approach, and demonstrate system-level technology by integrating the cryocooler with the superconducting RF electronics and performing integrated system testing."

The National Security Agencys (NSA) Commercial Solutions for Classified (CSfC) program offers an alternative to Type I CCI; however, its existing Mobile Access Capability Package (MACP) is ill-suited to this application because it relies on nested Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) tunnels that do not natively support multicast. During the Phase I program, WPL developed the Twice Encrypted and Authenticated Messaging (TEAM) solution and demonstrated that it can meet all of the Marine Corps stated requirements. In the proposed Phase II program, WPL will develop a scaled TEAM prototype for evaluation. We will demonstrate the TEAM scaled prototype in an ad hoc network of Windows- and Android-based end user devices, thereby showcasing the bandwidth efficiency of our native multicast solution versus the unicast-only MACP for secure group communications. We will also work throughout the Phase II program to carry TEAM through the CSfC certification process as an Addendum to the MACP."

        "abstract": "In modern military and commercial aircraft turbine engines, high cycle fatigue and foreign object damage are significant contributors to sustainment costs. Foreign object damage is most acute on the thin leading edges of titanium airfoils. Objects inadvertently ingested in the engine include small stones, aircraft fasteners, and birds. When these objects impact the rotating titanium airfoils, damage such as dents, nicks or tears result. Left undetected or uncorrected, this damage provides an ideal initiation site for high cycle fatigue cracks to form and propagate within the airfoil. Once these cracks reach a critical length, the airfoil will fracture resulting in significant secondary damage and a possible in-flight shutdown of the engine. The proposed program will develop an analytical tool for the design and repair of high cycle fatigue resistant integrally bladed disk airfoils. The analytical tool will be able to account for residual stresses while incorporating the probabilistic variability of airfoils. The analytical tool will serve to support airfoil design and will also be applicable to various airfoil repair cases."

The Phase II project will implement and test the Conformance Tool (CT) architecture developed in Phase I. The CT Hardware and Software Architecture is based on COTS products and technologies for the automated test platform. This project will generate the customized software test modules based on the Rules from the HOST Tier 1 and Tier 2 Standards. The Architecture calls for a self-contained test system housed in a typical 19 server rack, with all test equipment, cabling, Interface Test Assembly, and test management &amp; control computers included. The initial CT test system resulting from the Phase II Base project will be capable of rapidly testing any standard 6U OpenVPX component module (Circuit Card Assembly (CCA)) for compliance to HOST Rules. Other module form factors (i.e. 3U) and other OpenVPX backplane standards (i.e. fiber optic) will be added in later phases. We intend to develop support for other form factors and for system-level (LRU and multi-LRU) testing for conformance to HOST standards in later initiatives."

Recently, the ionic conductivity of solid electrolytes has improved significantly. Current solid-state batteries however, still suffer from low power and short cycle life, especially at low temperatures, due to poor interfacial conductivity and stability between solid electrolytes and electrode materials. Lynntech proposes to develop a practical all solid-state (PASS) lithium-ion battery (LIB) based on the combination of core-shell electrode materials and high conductivity solid electrolytes to provide high energy and power, long cycle life, as well as functionality over a wide operating temperature range. During Phase I, Lynntech have successfully developed advanced core-shell electrodes and high conductivity solid electrolytes. We have demonstrated the feasibility of core-shell electrode concept. Initial safety\/abuse testing showed that Lynntechs all solid-state Li-ion full cells are stable and safe under short circuit and overcharge conditions and flammability testing of electrolytes. During Phase II, Lynntech will develop a prototype 28 V PASS LIB system to meet the Navys performance requirements. Lynntech will also perform a preliminary cost estimate for battery manufacturing and demonstrate the manufacturing feasibility."

Using MOTSDA, operators will focus on promising alerts and regions of high interest that are generated by new automatic target discrimination techniques. MOTSDA provides a closed loop search and target alertment capability that works across wide geographic areas independent of operator fatigue and display. MOTSDA will improve active target discrimination by using a new classification feature. Key innovations include an automatic snippet confirmation detector that uses a short number of pings to confirm a targets presence and discriminate it from harsh clutter. A second innovation enables improved target classification in harsh clutter conditions when the target aspect averaged probability of detection is low. In Phase II, SSC will continue algorithm development using at-sea data sets, support Step 1 and 2 Advanced Processor Build evaluation of our Automatic Snippet Confirmation algorithm, provide a Step 1 briefing for our new classification feature, develop a real-time MOTSDA prototype processor and display, and evaluate the prototype in an at-sea closed loop test."

        "abstract": "The Navy requires a life raft that is small enough to fit within a front pocket on the body-worn survival ensemble. Having a pocket-sized raft at hand helps facilitate successful egress, inflation, and boarding. The required 12 cubic inches of stowed volume is a significant challenge, considering that a typical one-person raft compacts to about 700 cubic inches under vacuum. Safe, Inc. (Safe) has proposed a raft with innovative features to help meet this extreme volume reduction. The raft will be made of ultra-thin fabric that is two to four times thinner than current-generation flotation fabrics. The inflator will require about 12 times less volume than current inflation systems. The raft will be compressed to minimize its packed volume prior to vacuum sealing. Safes project team includes an experienced fabric developer and a manufacturer with practical experience building rafts from thin fabrics. Safes commercialization strategy assures flexibility to address both military and commercial markets."

        "abstract": "Systems Technology, Inc., with Dr. Eric Johnsons Research Team at Pennsylvania State University, directly address the Navy SBIR research defined in Topic N162-098, Aircraft Deck Motion Compensation Design. The objective of this topic is stated, Develop deck motion compensation algorithm and control law design methodology and guidance via airborne and\/or shipboard sensorsto improve aircraft boarding rate capabilities in high ship motion conditions. Moreover, the topic states, A design guidance and conceptual analysis toolset is needed for existing simulation environments to demonstrate the six-degree-of-freedom simulation response of an aircraft during a shipboard recovery. The objective has been addressed in the Phase I Base Program, where a prototype Rotorcraft Unmanned Aerial System - Deck Motion Compensation toolset (RUAS-DMC) was developed with a detailed RUAS model, a representative ship motion model, and a prototype DMC scheme based on the adaptive Generalized Predictive Control (GPC) algorithm. The Phase I Option Program will further enhance the toolset by incorporating flight test data to make RUAS-DMC more robust, will further advance the GPC-DMC algorithm, and will incorporate alternative guidance and control schemes. This naturally leads to the proposed Phase II Program where RUAS-DMC will be fully matured via extensive software additions and enhancements, extensive Monte Carlo simulations, hardware-in-the-loop tests, and flight tests with a relevant RUAS and ship deck. The Phase II Program focus is on the development of successful guidance and control scheme(s) to improve boarding rates. Moreover, toolset modularity and portability is a goal, so that specific components can be incorporated into existing tools (e.g., CASTLE and MATLAB\/Simulink). Generality is also a goal, so that the DMC toolset and scheme(s) are also applicable to fixed-wing carrier landing. At the end of the Phase II Program, RUAS-DMC will be well positioned for transition to Navy acquisition programs PMA-266 and PMA-268."

        "abstract": "The proposed work has two companion objectives. Objective #1 is to assess the feasibility of developing a prototype Systems Engineering Analysis and Documentation (SEAD) tool which effectively supports the analysis of static and dynamic systems, manages output data, documents and communicates the results. The tool will be designed to interface with, and use, system information\/descriptive models. Objective #2 is to host an Automatic Carrier Landing System (ACLS) domain model within the tool which encodes the tests, evaluations, examples, and design guidance appearing in Sections 6.4, 10 and 11 of the Carrier Suitability Testing Manual. The tool will host legacy ACLS models for the CASTLE non-linear F\/A-18C\/D model, a linear F\/A-18C\/D model and an A-7E model. The tool will support automated testing of these models against the Carrier Suitability test suite and will display the results against established design criteria. In Phase II Option 1, the ACLS domain model will be extended to include a model of the UCAS-D aircraft using the JPALS recovery system. The Phase II Option 2 will extend the ACLS domain to include the MQ-8C Fire Scout together with a model of the UCARS radar recovery system and environmental disturbances for DDG class ships."

Two types of information are needed in order to accurately predict structural integrity: damage data and structural response. Current SHM systems utilize PZT actuators and fiber optic (FO) sensors separately. The goal of the program is to develop an integrated systems approach for a hybrid SHM system consisting of a hybrid piezoelectricfiberoptic (PZTFO) sensor network, monolithic connector for both sensor types, and data acquisition hardware\/software integrated into a single unit that will take advantage of any commonality in electronic components. In Phase II, the team of Acellent, IFOS and Bell Helicopters will develop the monitoring system interfaced with the V-22 VSLED along with validation and proof testing. The end product will be a hybrid PZT-FO system that can easily perform structural health monitoring tasks. The use of Acellents patented SMART Layer will eliminate the need to install each sensor individually on the structure and the layer can easily be mounted on any structure in minimum installation time."

Unless we develop a better approach, it becomes cost prohibitive to integrate additional technologies and capabilities. Current integration approaches seek to address this complexity through managed commonality and shared infrastructure. While this approach works for a distributed application, it fails when applied to the system-of-systems integration problem.This research extends our established sematic model capabilities with the ability to generate configured, extensible integration software. This generated framework will seamlessly enable integration of disparate systems, with minimal manual effort. Where needed for performance, the generated infrastructure can leverage aspects of system homogeneitybut it is not required. Rather than a monolithic integration library, our infrastructure is based on a small set of modular operation primitives with the integration compiler assembling and optimizing the integration logic. This process, scales regardless of the number of systems, interfaces, messages, or protocols. The result of this research will be a semantic-based model driven integration capability that fundamentally solves the disparate system integration challenges (security, performance, redundancy, flexibility, extensibility) that plague todays systems-of systems integration efforts."

The CoWiR will be an all-weather system capable of providing precise information about the distribution of wind velocity vectors surrounding a ship with accuracy better than 1.5 knots and a data update rate of up to 10 Hz. In Phase I, POC both theoretically and experimentally demonstrated the feasibility of the CoWiR approach with a proof-of-concept prototype capable of measuring wind speed at a distance. In Phase II, POC plans to develop a fully operational prototype and validate its accuracy and coverage in a relevant outdoor environment as well as in a wind tunnel, demonstrate performance in poor weather conditions, and evaluate the systems ability to withstand environmental conditions according to Navy requirements. At the end of Phase II, the CoWiR system is expected to reach TRL 6 and full cost and integration feasibility assessments will be complete."

        "abstract": "Modern military and commercial gas turbine engines are subject to increased durability, performance, and safety issues when operating in austere environments where significant quantities of sand, volcanic ash and dust are present and can be ingested into the engines. These environments include desert regions, as well as, previously active\/currently active volcanic areas. Military studies of turbine engine sand, dust, and ash ingestion have shown that certain constituents, typically those containing CMAS (calcium-magnesium-alumino-silicate) compound minerals and\/or Chlorides and Sulfates, are particularly detrimental to engine turbine components. These compound minerals, known as reactive media, have one or more physical or chemical characteristics, including but not limited to size, mass, mineralogy and chemical composition. Reactive media has been found to have significant and rapid detrimental effects on engine performance, durability and operability. Currently, there are no aircraft\/engine sensors that can provide the information needed to understand the specific composition, size and concentration of ingested reactive material, which is a key factor in determining if reactive media is being ingested into the engine. In response to this need, Innoveering is developing a novel sensor system that that can measure the composition, size and concentration of particles being ingested by a gas turbine in flight."

The solution is scalable and can be readily adapted to new and higher speed I\/O bus structures. The methodology will also enable testing of bus protocols at various levels.

One of the key questions is how much fidelity is required for the simulation. Instead of questionable rules of thumb, developers need scientifically validated methods and tools for understanding and choosing the optimum level of fidelity for training simulations. Such tools can guide the development, evaluation, and acquisition of existing and new simulation-based training technology that is affordable and supports efficient learning. Based on our successful Phase I demonstration, we will develop and evaluate Simulating Training Results to Understand Differing Effects of Fidelity on Learning (STRUDEL). STRUDEL models how simulation fidelity, trainee experience, and task interact to produce different learning outcomes, and it includes tools to understand how the model applies to Navy training simulations and fidelity choices for future training solutions."

        "abstract": "An upcoming Navy program requires a substantial improvement in the speed of deploying undersea cables for communication, surveillance and control systems. Raytheon Integrated Defense Systems is working to create the new system. A critical component of the cable joint protection system is the polyethylene covering that is assembled in parts. These components must be fused to form a long-lasting watertight seal. Raytheon has determined that non-contact heating is the ideal polyethylene joining approach. Grid Logic has a portfolio of induction heating technologies, including a new ultra-high frequency method called Micro-Induction Heating, that can spatially-localize magnetic flux. These technologies could be adapted to create a rapid non-contact welding system to quickly heat metallic wires or particles embedded in polyethylene parts. As targeted volumes of polyethylene melt, polymer chains diffuse between the parts creating strong permanent joints. The companys technology might also be extended to provide a non-destructive inspection capability that could be used in-process. The objective of this SBIR Phase II project is to establish the enabling technology for a suitable polyethylene welding device based on Grid Logics technology. During the project, Grid Logic and Raytheon will also investigate heating element alternatives to make the polyethylene joining operation most effective."

        "abstract": "KCF Technologies understands that new CBM technology is required for realized Total Ownership Cost (TOC) reductions on many Navy platforms including winches. In particular, advanced solutions are needed to accurately predict component performance and maintenance from which overhauls can be reduced, work task times shortened, and maintenance logistics optimized. The lack of advanced monitoring technologies necessary to perform high fidelity diagnostics and prognosticswithin the constraints of most Navy platforms and logistics infrastructurerepresent a key technology gap that must be bridged to derive increased operational readiness and cost saving. In this project, advanced diagnostic and prognostic algorithms will be combined with KCFs mature commercial industrial machine monitoring solution. This marriage of technologies will be tailored and applied to the unique requirements of Navy winches."

Significant risk to capability and safety is incurred when obsolescence is reached while equipment is at sea and unavailable for upgrade. The government has defined practices to mitigate such risks while lowering the overall total cost of ownership. Active parts list monitoring and screening can minimize risk by consistently cross checking equipment configurations against industry discontinuance notifications. Such practices are presently not automated by technology and require significant effort by personnel to implement.Progeny utilized our extensive expertise accrued from over twenty years of systems engineering and integration (SE&amp;I) across multiple software and hardware manufacturing initiatives to successfully create an innovative solution within Phase I of this SBIR which is built upon graph database technology in order to maximize the utility of relationships in our knowledge base. Our COTS Obsolescence Decision Analysis (CODA) solution performs automated life cycle management of shipboard COTS hardware and software and unsupervised creation of mitigation recommendations through the integration of four innovative techniques for accomplishing data collection, data storage, automated analysis, and highly intuitive information visualization."

The proposed system is constructed with (1) a gated linear frequency modulated continuous wave (LFMCW) time division multiple access (TDMA) multiple input multiple output (MIMO) synthetic aperture radar (SAR), (2) an inertial measurement unit (IMU), (3) a data processor, (4) a set of laser indicators, and (5) a monitor. The basic idea of the sensor system is to scan the wall of the target room, and form an image of the wall with high resolution depth information and proper angular resolution (cross range resolution). When there is no hidden chamber, the radar will receive a reflected signal from the room wall. When there is a hidden chamber behind the room wall, there will be at least two reflected signals, one from the room internal wall and the other from the chamber wall. Thus, the hidden chamber can be detected, localized, and displayed on the monitor."

Based on our experience we believe that the RF spectrum is a natural fit to solve this problem. Therefore we have constrained our trade space for an optimized microwave technology solution.VAWD proposes techniques that will use Multi-Frequency discrimination in order to have reliable detection and identification hidden chambers. The Multi-Frequency techniques will use some of the same radar hardware and signal processing concepts that enabled us to penetrate through common building materials such as brick, cinder block, concrete, wood, sheet rock, ply wood, etc. and measure human micro-Doppler. The difference is to simultaneously use a higher frequency that does not penetrate through obstructions. This frequency will be about ten times the STTW frequency with an antenna pattern designed to mimic the STTW antenna. This technique allows the system to discriminate between multipath within the room and reflections from another chamber. The structure features will be classified into rooms so that hidden chambers can be identified."

Fogging of the lenses during routine use, however, is among the top complaints reported for protective eyewear and the leading cause of eyewear removal in the field during times of high physical exertion or during ingress-egress of buildings and rapidly changing environments, precisely when eye protection and clarity of vision are most needed. For these reasons, TDA is performing a feasibility study of technologies available for active anti-fogging systems available for Military tactical eyewear. This study will analyze and test currently available anti-fogging technologies and determine the most deployable active anti-fogging option for Military protective eyewear.

        "abstract": "ABOM has developed a novel active anti-fog technology platform that has solved the problem of eyewear fogging. These fog-free and ballistics-rated polycarbonate lenses provide the individual soldier with sustained distant visual acuity and improved situational awareness. Under this proposed SBIR Phase I project, ABOM will perform evaluation and feasibility studies for four proposed Military Combat Eye Protection (MCEP) candidates (two tactical goggles and two spectacles). All MCEP candidates will incorporate ABOMs active anti-fog technology platform and will be evaluated for lower size, weight, and power (SWaP) characteristics; abrasion resistance; individual equipment compatibility; ultraviolet blocking; maximum field of view; ballistic resistance; impact resistance; optical performance compliance; and cost-effective design. Feasibility studies will also evaluate centralized power source\/management system connections as a primary or recharging power source. Future integration opportunities include see-through heads-up-displays, physiologic and surveillance sensors, and communications technologies. The primary objective of this SBIR Phase I project is to select one of the four active anti-fog MCEP candidates to progress to Phase II using a down selection criteria matrix for translation into a stable, producible, sustainable, and cost-effective design that will enhance soldiers situational awareness, operational readiness, and sustained human performance\/effectiveness while operating in harsh environmental conditions."

The proposed Phase I feasibility study will analyze the IT Governance processes required within SOCOM to enable this innovative approach to come to fruition, the workforce training required, the human resource policies to vet freelancers, the requirements elicitation processes, project management, solution acceptance and testing, rapid deployment via a devops environment, and invoice presentment and payment. The feasibility of an integrated platform that supports all of the business processes leveraging open source technologies and commercial-off-the-shelf products will be explored to rapidly build out the solution. Since the original introduction of reverse auctions for services by GE, innovative companies have expanded this concept to IT services. Despite early successes, several challenges remain since procuring services is not as simple as procuring goods, and issues such as proper requirements, testing and deployment models need to be more rigorous to ensure success. The Phase I study will encompass these issues, provide recommendations and a roadmap for this transformative business process."

        "abstract": "Space superiority requires space protection and space situational awareness (SSA), which rely on rapid and accurate space object behavioral and operational intent discovery. The focus of this project is to develop a stochastic approach for rapid discovery of evasive satellite behaviors. Designing the innovative decision support tool has numerous challenges: (i) partial observable actions; (ii) evasive resident space objects; (iii) uncertainties modeling and propagation; (iv) real-time requirement and computational intractable algorithms.We propose a solution called Adaptive Markov Inference Game Optimization (AMIGO) for rapid discovery of evasive satellite behaviors. AMIGO is an adaptive feedback game theoretic approach. It gets information through sensors about the relations between the RSOs and ground\/space surveillance assets (SAs). The relations are determined by both the RSOs and SAs. Therefore, it is a game instead of control problem. The game reasoning interacts with data level fusion, the uncertainty modeling\/propagation, and RSO detection\/tracking to predict the future RSOs-SAs relations. The game engine also supports optional space pattern dictionary\/semantic rules for adaptive transition matrices in our Markov game. The outputs of our game reasoning include two kinds of controls: one for SAs and the other for RSOs. The two sets form a game equilibrium."

        "abstract": "Verification of the Guidance, Navigation and Control (GN&amp;C) algorithms and software utilized onboard spacecraft is of paramount importance to ensure resilient, correct operation after launch. Rather than wait until the GN&amp;C software has been deployed to perform on-orbit verification, offline verification integrated into the design process will improve mission performance, significantly reduce the risk of mission failure, and reduce overall deployment costs. Verus Research and our partner the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech) propose to establish the applicability of formal methods to offline verification of GN&amp;C systems, as opposed to simulation-based methods, to capture the multitude of uncertainties still present at earlier stages of development and prior to on-orbit testing, while providing rigorous assertions of requirements despite such uncertainties. The Verus Research team proposes a combination of transverse Lyapunov stability and reachability analysis techniques to verify robust stability and invariance properties of GN&amp;C algorithms. In Phase I, we will focus on verifying stability requirements of the attitude control system, with extensions to more general requirements and algorithms in Phase II. We will leverage the ASTROS facility at Georgia Tech to perform verification of GN&amp;C algorithms via Simulink models, and finally confirm the algorithm performance through hardware testing."

        "abstract": "In response to the challenges described in AF173-CT05, Applied Defense Solutions (ADS) and the University of New Mexico (UNM) (equivalently, the ADS Team) propose to research and develop innovative validation and verification (V&amp;V) algorithms for spacecraft GN&amp;C. The ADS Team is unique in that it brings operational flight GN&amp;C software experience (ADS) with cutting edge research on algorithm V&amp;V (UNM) together. The overall goal is to shift the paradigm in GN&amp;C software development practice from pre-flight simulations combined with on-orbit testing, to more resilient formal V&amp;V design approaches that reduce the reliance on simulation and on-orbit testing. The proposed V&amp;V algorithms: 1) are near real-time computable, 2) assure probabilistic safety and performance, and 3) solve both the maneuver-safety (falsification) and synthesis problems. The approaches and solutions developed by the ADS Team of world class researchers and practitioners of GN&amp;C software design and development will investigate approaches to V&amp;V of algorithms for GN&amp;C of spacecraft. This work is expected to result in a more robust GN&amp;C software that reduces dependence on on-orbit testing."

Patient handoffs are a crucial part of casualty care, both in military and civilian environments; and today handoffs are being performed in less than optimal fashion, with ineffective communications accounting for 80% of the handoff errors. Our new HTC3 Framework for simulation-based handoff training at all levels of casualty care will focus initially on the tactical, in-theater steps from initial aid though en-route care and facility acceptance.We will consider the Joint nature of medicine at these levels, which requires communication across Services, as well as the frequent need for communication across cultures.Similar considerations hold in the civilian sphere, and are also amenable to simulation-based training.Our HTC3 Framework product will be a suite of software tools that provides the means for creating simulation-based medical handoff training programs including in-situ team and individual assessment. The Phase II prototype will be a training system designed to work closely with a selected program of record.The tools and program will also support civilian activities such as disaster response, fire fighting, humanitarian aid, and day-to-day medical emergency services."

        "abstract": "Research has identified that handoffs are particularly important communication processes, during which communication error can lead to patient safety situations. Organizations have created standard practices and training materials to encourage teamwork communication for handoffs, however these do not necessarily capture the needs of military medicine of combat casualty care. Combat casualty handoffs can be even more complex, allowing for more opportunity for error. They require specific protocols and techniques that address the unique needs of the patients, providers, and environments and will allow for effective communication and information transfer.Thus, the proposed effort aims to design and develop a new concept for handoff protocols, for use through the continuum of care for combat casualty care. The CCHAT Handoff Protocol will outline the protocol for the purpose of implementation into an automated speech recognition system. The effort will develop descriptions of the correct methodology for performing a combat casualty handoff and a description of the concept of operations for future handoff training systems. These descriptions will be used to create the speech ontology for the speech recognition training system. This effort will result in the protocol documentation needed for the DHA17B-001 performer to develop requirements for a speech recognition prototype."

        "abstract": "The experimental validation of the DoDs weapon systems is at the cornerstone of national security considerations. The structural requirements for the targets utilized impose a severe cost and lead time burden due to the limitations imposed by the traditional manufacturing processes currently used. Novel manufacturing methods for metal alloys have been established in the past years, but they have yet to be incorporated into the DoDs target manufacturing supply chain. Our extensive experience with powder consolidation, parts manufacturing and additive manufacturing (AM) has led us to identify a combination of technologies to rapidly produce the required test items at a fraction of the current cost. We thus believe that 3D printing holds the potential for the production of printed green parts suitable for microwave (MW) sintering to consolidate them into materials of near theoretical density and strength. Our proposal will outline the advantages and limitations of each method, a robust work plan to address the current challenge and a solution to provide an expedited and low-cost manufacturing process for MDAs lethality articles. Beyond this specific application, we foresee a market in specialized industrial parts where the machining costs are elevated, all of which MATSYS will become a commercial supplier.Approved for Public Release | 18-MDA-9522 (23 Feb 18)"

        "abstract": "The use of laser technologies and high-power electronics is rapidly being incorporated into tactical platforms for imaging, target designation, and range finding. Electronic equipment including lasers demand power from a tactical aircraft and produce large amounts of thermal energy as a waste product. Current thermal management technologies will not be sufficient for future aircraft as thermal management of the high-power electronic equipment has become challenging and will become even more challenging as the heat loads continue to increase. As such, innovative thermal management technologies must be developed to keep pace with the increasing thermal demands and allow tactical aircraft to effectively perform their missions. Development of novel thermal management methods will be a lynch pin for incorporating high-energy electronics and lasers on future and current aircraft. Carbon dioxide has advantages as a working fluid in vapor compression cycle with higher specific heat and much higher volumetric heat density. The higher volumetric heat density reduces the size of the components such as the condenser, evaporator and compressor, resulting in improved size, weight, power and performance. A carbon dioxide vapor compression cycle is being proposed for its flexibility in operation, ability to be expanded, and volumetric reduction of potentially 80%."

The long-term objective of the proposed work is to understand why these differences occur and improve the target detection predictive capability of the models. Our approach in Phase I is to analyze bistatic sonar data collected on Navy assets. We will examine both cases with model\/data agreement and cases with disagreement. Leveraging previous research, we will evaluate possible physical causes for the disagreement with emphasis on scenarios where a surface duct is present to trap acoustic energy. We will attempt to improve the TL model predictions by incorporating additional information such as that derived from in situ environmental sensors or ocean models. The findings will then form the basis of a recommendation for the development of concrete solutions in Phase II."

        "abstract": "As underwater threats continue to evolve, active sonar systems and operators must evolve with them, requiring improvements to sources, receivers, signal processing algorithms, and search mission planning applications in order to maintain and improve detection rates. Any improvements in the latter requires a detailed and accurate understanding of the acoustic underwater environment, and the underlying sound propagation that leads to acoustic detection. However, the uncertainty underlying existing acoustic modeling approaches and databases makes predicting complex acoustic features challenging. Daniel H. Wagner Associates, together with the University of Michigan Department of Mechanical Engineering, propose an Active Sonar Statistical Estimation Tool (ASSET) that will very efficiently characterize environmental uncertainty and identify regions where acoustically important phenomena are likely to occur. ASSET will provide a probabilistic assessment of the detection process that accounts for uncertainties arising from random acoustic fluctuations, short-term and long-term water-column temperature fluctuations, and uncertainty arising from sea state variations that can be incorporated into anti-submarine warfare (ASW) mission planning aids."

        "abstract": "The littoral environment is especially demanding on tactical sonar systems, in large part because the spatial and temporal variability imposes sonar system operating conditions of a nature and with a scale heretofore not encountered in the open oceans. Recent Office of Naval Research (ONR) sponsored basic research as well as fleet exercises have shown that littoral environments tactically important to the US Navy have rapidly varying sound speed profiles (direction and time dependent) along with directional wind-wave conditions and horizontally anisotropic bottom properties that result in spatial and temporal anisotropies in transmission loss. Most existing TL models within fleet Tactical Development Aids (TDAs) and System Performance Prediction (SPP) capabilities are accurate when the inputs are appropriately modeled and accounted for. But often there are not enough sensors in the water to sample the temporal and spatial variability sufficiently and the model outputs are inaccurate. This proposal addresses these deficiencies in acoustic models by leveraging highly-sampled GFI measurements of oceanographic variability to inform sonar detection uncertainty estimates and predictions of sensor-level output, to aid asset placement, enhance test planning, and improve accuracy of post-test reconstruction."

        "abstract": "Operational experts collect recorded data about emerging tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) from sources such as live and virtual training exercises, and numerous test and evaluation simulations. However, instructional designers cannot easily reuse the recorded data to create new training. Without sufficient access to operational experts, expert knowledge is inaccessible and fragmented, often locked within documents like after-action reports, interviews, test summaries, and accident reports. So, instructional designers need a way to unlock the expert knowledge in written reports and recorded data. SoarTech and GTRI propose a data analytics approach that draws knowledge from written reports to transform recorded data into training content. Meaning-Aligned Record Synthesis for Training Emerging Capabilities (MARSTEC) leverages GTRIs academic leadership in textual analysis and semantic reasoning, combined with SoarTechs Training Analytics research team experienced in data analytics and research application specific to Naval training needs. MARSTEC will deliver the following key capabilities: First, narrative meaning capture unlocks the expert knowledge in text documents such as AARs. Second, aligned recording analysis replaces blind big-data approaches with informed analytics. Third, multimodal training integration supports instructional designers, unit commanders, and individual learners. As a result of our research, MARSTEC will enable fast and effective instruction for new TTPs."

Our proposed solution combines proven, current and emerging technologies to provide an innovative and integrated solution for the training community.

To enable truly adaptive training, training systems need to both (1) automatically generate training scenarios and (2) automatically assess trainee performance. Lastly, (3) diagnostic visualization technologies must enable instructors and analysts to validate the outputs and processes of the complex automation technologies. TOPMAST (Training Operational Performance via Measure Automation and Scenario-generation Technology) is an adaptive training solution that will repurpose tactical training data to enable adaptive training at scale. TOPMAST will enhance existing simulation technologies to automate requisite adaptive training capabilities (challenge 1). Bayesian statistics and a supervised reinforcement learning framework will automatically discover which Measures of Performance are most predictive of a trainees mission performance (challenge 2). Advanced, high-dimensional data visualizations will provide a user-friendly view of the automated measurement discovery processes and will empower instructors and analysts with the knowledge of the automated systems reasoning (challenge 3). This understanding will ensure instructors remain in control of tactical training despite their usage of automated technologies."

        "abstract": "Naval aircraft components are routinely made of 7000 series aluminum alloys due to their strength, weight and fatigue properties. Present Additive Manufacturing (AM) processes falls short of producing 7000 series Al alloys successfully due to lack of porosity, thermal and composition control. In-situ methods implemented to date largely only yield information about the component surface and other more advanced techniques capable of inspecting sub-surface have been tested ex-situ, but are yet to be integrated. In order to develop a proof of concept for a novel AM process for use with 7000 series Al alloys, and to demonstrate its feasibility to address material reflectivity and residual stresses produced during solidification, the following three challenging tasks are proposed in Phase I: (1) The first is the defect identification, monitoring and chemical composition prediction, (2) The second is the estimation and mitigation of residual stress through hardness prediction using smart optical monitoring system (SOMS), and (3) The third is the feasibility study on the integration of in-process monitoring system into AM control system. The integration of laser-based AM system with SOMS system will be designed and evaluated to accommodate in-house fabrication capability to produce the coupon samples during the AM sample development phase."

        "abstract": "To meet the U.S. Navy, specifically PMA-201, need for nondestructive evaluation (NDE) of concrete, including evaluating its strength, material properties, and damage localization, Luminit, LLC, and Southern Illinois University (SIU) propose to develop a novel Concrete Materials Characterization (COMAC) system, combining several methods of concrete characterization into a single sensor\/software combination. The COMAC will use ultrasonic, physical, thermal, and radiographic methods to measure macroscopic values, then combine these measurements to calculate relevant concrete parameters. The combination of complementary measurements will provide a faster and more accurate characterization of the concrete to be measured, and will provide data for inclusion into Holmquist-Johnson-Cook modeling and the Navys hydrocode models. The COMAC will fit within 6 cubic feet, weigh less than 20 pounds, and be capable of a complete operationincluding setup, test, and packing upin under 45 minutes. In Phase I, we will analyze the available technologies and determine the minimum set that will provide the complete information needed, ending with a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 3 laboratory test prototype and software description. During Phase II we will develop this into a fully testable engineering prototype that, after testing by the Navy, will be at TRL 6."

We will make different types of concrete with variations in constituent ratios as test samples; use ASTM tests to destructively determine true strength; collect nondestructive testing (NDT) data; correlate NDT data to ASTM data; develop statistical bounds on both the NDT data and the correlations to ASTM strengths; and design the Phase II prototype.The Phase I work will provide evidence that the proposed approach can produce accurate, rapid, on-site assessment of concrete properties. This assessment is applicable to curing, fully cured, and aged concrete. The sensitivity of microwave signals to chemical and physical changes in materials makes microwave-based techniques ideal for interrogating many properties of concrete structures. We will demonstrate feasibility of microwave-based techniques to evaluate concrete materials properties such as mixing proportions, compressive strength, and aggregate distribution. We will also develop a testing methodology that is rapid, accurate and can be performed with a hand-portable device suitable for in-field measurements (to be developed in Phase II)."

These tools are an expansion, enhancement, and focusing of those already under developed as a part of RDRTec efforts on the ongoing Triton DAA radar development. The FAA is the certifying authority for civilian UAVs with DAA that are presented to them by developing companies. The Navy self-certifies DAA systems to operate not only in civil airspace but also in military airspace and Due Regard operation; however, it has the additional responsibility of effectively and efficiently procuring the system from contractors that it will be certifying after development. PMAs are responsible for procurement and TAEs are responsible for certification. DAA non-cooperative sensor certification is in its infancy. The evidence required for certification has not been completely formalized. The dilemma is that efficient cost-effective procurements require upfront understanding of certification process and evidence requirements. Tools are needed to perform analysis that connect performance to requirements within the Size Weight and Power Cooling (SWaPC) and maneuver limits of the particular UAV throughout the procurement process beginning during pre-award."

Our experience in bio-inspired robot (including jellyfish), nonconventional actuation, and energy harvesting development promises to provide a tactically relevant solution. We can show feasibility in the short term as well as major advantages from cutting edge approaches in the long term. Driven by a prime contractor that has over 20 years of proven success commercializing technologies including maritime devices, the MEDUSAE project promises success for ONR and future transition partners. Our team and our network of connections to the user community provide reduced risk with increased probability of transition. The MEDUSAE concept provides a low cost, station keeping, energy harvesting solution for long term use (greater than or equal to 12 months). PH I will generate proof of concept and align PH II for success through use of our existing capabilities and technology in the oceanographic, dropsonde, and sensor markets and a focus on the main challenges of this specific development (mobility and power)."

        "abstract": "Tool materials development has been the major limit for the application of friction stir technologies\/welding (FSW) on hard alloys such as steels and titanium alloys over the past decade. During friction stir welding on steels, temperatures can exceed 1000C, so the tool material needs to be strong enough to sustain wearing and deformation at elevated temperatures for long times. There are two major draw backs of tool materials developed previously: short life time and expensive processing routes. Therefore, it is urgent to develop a new low-cost tool material with longer life time. In this STTR program, QuesTek Innovations and University of North Texas (UNT) propose to design a WC-based tool material with refractory high entropy alloys (HEA) or MAX phases as binders, by combining Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME) and experimental approaches. QuesTek will apply the ICME approach to design and optimize the WC-based tool material and UNT will process and test the material with their expertise in FSW. The final goal of this program is to design a suitable tool material for FSW on high strength low alloy (HSLA) steels and other alloys at a lower cost."

These smart capabilities include collaborative IoT sensors and platforms that are self-aware and provide capabilities of self-prediction, self-configuration, and self-maintenance. To fully take advantage of these advances, however, testbeds and frameworks are needed to evaluate IoT approaches in representative laboratory and operational environments that allow for a fly before you buy approach when replacing traditional sensors and networked platforms with smart IoT alternatives.In response to these needs, we propose to develop an IoT Agent (IoTA) Framework that provides a path to evolve and evaluate intelligent agent designs that interface with Naval IoT sensors and platforms. This path supports early stages of design driven by behavioral simulation environments, through interaction with hardware in a laboratory setting, with eventual support for interaction with actual hardware in an operational setting.The proof of concept will demonstrate several scenarios in Joint Semi-Automated Forces (JSAF) or a similar simulation environment and show how IoTA is used to test and evaluate IoT solutions by driving hardware sensors and systems from actual, emulated, and simulated environments while extracting key performance metrics from the IoT target."

        "abstract": "Additive manufacturing (AM) fills a technical need for the US Navy to produce on-site, on-demand, cost efficient parts. However, the lack of established procedures for AM machines and processes introduces significant variability in their mechanical behavior. A high throughput method is needed to characterize the variability in the mechanical properties of AM materials using large statistics. To meet this need, Corvid will leverage their computational modeling and test design capabilities with UofLs additive manufacturing expertise to develop an innovative mechanical test approach using miniature specimens. This mechanical testing will be combined with thermal imaging of the melting process and X-ray computed tomography (CT) of the grain\/porosity to thoroughly characterize AM materials across various length scales. Lastly advanced algorithms will be developed to correlate the mechanical properties with the microstructure and build process to create a non-destructive approach for inspecting quality of AM materials. By combining these elements of the process-structure-property relationship, Corvid and UofL will provide the Navy with a robust, high throughput testing approach to understand the variability of additive manufactured materials and advance computational models of the AM process."

        "abstract": "In the setting of altitude-induced hypoxia, operator cognitive capacity degrades and can compromise both individual and team performance. This degradation is linked to falling brain energy (ATP) levels and an increased reliance on anaerobic energy production from glucose. Ketone bodies are the evolutionary alternative substrate to glucose for brain metabolic requirements; previous studies have shown that the presence of elevated ketone bodies (ketosis) maintains brain ATP levels and reduce cerebral anaerobic glycolysis during hypoxia. Ketosis can be achieved when fasting or following a ketogenic diet; however, these approaches are impractical for military operators in the field. Exogenous ketone ester supplementation allows for rapid (&lt; 30 mins) and significant elevation of blood ketone levels without the need to maintain a diet or fast.HVMN, in collaboration with researchers at IHMC, proposes a study to investigate the effects of consuming an FDA-approved ketone ester food on operationally relevant cognitive performance in the setting of hypoxia. For the proposed 4-arm within-subject study, participants will complete a cognitive performance test battery under the conditions of normoxia or hypoxia following consumption of a ketone ester drink or a placebo drink. We hypothesize that ketone ester supplementation will attenuate hypoxia-induced deterioration of operator cognitive performance."

Acclimatization is important in this context because a warfighter who is acclimatized to high altitude is immune to high altitude illness, has superior work capacity, and has cognitive function approaching that found at sea level. In other words, the acclimatized warfighter is optimally equipped for task completion at high altitudes. Currently no drugs are known that will cause a warfighter to become acclimatized. We propose thatpre-treatment with proly hydroxylase inhibitors at low altitude will mimic acclimatization thus creating for warfighters during acute exposure to high altitude immunity to high-altitude illness, along with improved exercise and cognitive performance."

        "abstract": "Recognizing faces in low-light and nighttime conditions is a challenging problem due to the noisy and poor quality nature of the images.Thermal imaging is often used to obtain facial biometric in such conditions. Thermal face images, while having a strong signature at nighttime, are not typically maintained in biometric-enabled watch lists and so must be compared with visible-light face images to enable face recognition in low lighting conditions.In this project, wea thorough feasibility study to investigate the limits of current deep learning-based cross-modal matching algorithms for visible-to-thermal matching.In particular, the goals of this project are as follows:-Collect a dataset consisting of face signatures across the spectrum from 100 subjects using the Army Research Laboratory Government Furnished Equipment (GFE).-Integrate, fine-tune and evaluate the best performing face verification and recognition system from the JANUS project on the new heterogeneous face dataset.-Design and evaluate a robust deep learning-based domain adaptive matching system (or systems) for cross-domain face recognition. Address the risks and potential payoffs of this technology"

        "abstract": "Military systems operate in complex, adversarial environments where their initial planned operations are often overcome by events, but soldiers use those systems in creative ways to achieve their mission objectives. For example, complex ground robotic systems that were initially deployed for surveillance and explosive ordinance disposal have instead been used as decoys, ammunition carriers, and other creative applications. While AI systems are creating a revolution in civilian autonomous systems, they are not aimed at achieving this type of creativity in the face of adversity. Generating creative plans requires a more fundamental understanding of the capabilities and potential functions of system components. We propose to develop CPS, a planning and plan execution system that will enable future autonomous systems to creatively solve problems for which they were not originally designed or prepared, yielding robust autonomous systems that achieve mission success even in novel, unexpected scenarios. Key research advances will include:-Abstract models for understanding how system components can be combined in novel ways.-Creative configuration and hybrid systems planning to create new compositions of primitive capabilities that will achieve complex system goals.-Adaptation via trial and error, robustly achieving goals despite inaccurate models and continuously degrading capabilities."

        "abstract": "Modern air-cycle machines (ACMs) depend on dry lubricating coatings to protect the foil bearing during operation; however, the current coating solutions are suspected of outgassing noxious gases during operation that could prove harmful or fatal to pilots. A new non-outgassing coating technology is necessary that will extend the lifetime and performance of these bearings without compromising pilot health.The Phase I results definitively demonstrated the developed coating met and exceeded all specified Phase I requirements and goals. Compared to industry PTFE\/polyimide technologies, the developed coating exhibited a 5x reduction in the CoF (and a concomitant reduction in friction induced temperature spikes), and was demonstrated to be over 1,000,000 times more wear resistant after the initial break in period.For the Phase II program, Nokomis will demonstrate the technology through a battery of tribology experiments that culminate in the testing of an actual air foil bearing in a relevant naval environment (inside an ACM). Nokomis perform relevant MIL-STD-810G certification testing through the Base Period and Option Periods of the effort.The proposed technology will provide NAVAIR with an improved and safe alternative to the current technologies."

        "abstract": "The addition of CNTs traditional steel cabling has the potential to significantly improve cable strength and longevity. However, previous methods for CNT integration struggle due to CNT aggregation and poor interfacial interactions between CNT and matrix. Mainstreams CNT coating process is based on a simple, scalable, one-pot process that uses emulsion chemistry to coat a metal on the surface of the nanotubes. This coating provides an iron-coated CNT nanopowder which enhances the binding of the CNT to the steel matrix, improves mixability, and limits aggregation. In addition, the emulsion chemistry enhances the matrix\/CNT interface, improving both mechanical properties. During the Phase I, Mainstream showed a 90% increase in fatigue life by integrating Fe-coated CNTs into a pure iron matrix. During the Phase II work, we will advance the state-of-the-art FeCNT encapsulation process developed during Phase I and optimize the composite loading, mixing, and fabricating conditions before testing in relevant conditions."

Based on the Phase I results, we propose to assemble and demonstrate a fully integrated, intuitive and user friendly, Live USPL Characterization System, termed LUCS, using novel methods of data capture, data reduction, and distributed processing. Phase II work will integrate the individual diagnostics selected in Phase I into a compact man-portable system designed for the near and short-wave infrared bands of 600-1700-nm, with a 3-5-m band system developed in the option. In addition, the single shot phase characterization technique will be realized in an extremely compact geometry, which will be insensitive to both alignment and beam profile, simultaneously providing detailed temporal and phase profiles. Advanced data reduction algorithms and system architectures will be implemented and a single graphical user interface (GUI) will display user selectable, processed, laser parameters including live tracking of statistical variations in figures-of-merit. Additionally, the GUI will provide control of all diagnostic system components. The GUI will initially run on a laptop and will ultimately be available as a tablet or smartphone app. The diagnostic subsystems will be seamlessly integrated to provide rapid data processing, with display updates exceeding 10-Hz."

        "abstract": "It has long been established that the best way to learn is to have a private tutor who works with you one-on-one, adapting the training to your learning needs. In such settings, one can: ask questions, get feedback on an approach, and suggestions on how to improve. A skilled tutor will identify a students strengths and weaknesses and adapt teaching to emphasize solutions that take advantage of the students individual talents. Private tutors are too costly for all but the most affluent, while experts are, in general, too busy to mentor as they once did. The need for individualized instruction, however, has remained. This is particularly true in complex decision making environments such as Anti-Submarine Warfare where trainees need to be prepared for situations that are highly varied. Discovery Machine Incorporated describes how adaptive training for tactical decision making can be obtained through the use of Virtual Observer\/Controllers, which shall be developed to mimic human observer\/controllers(O\/Cs). Human O\/Cs provide a type of apprentice training. These O\/Cs watch what the trainees do and inject challenges based on how the trainees have performed. They also adapt the training to make sure that the trainee is getting the most out of their training"

        "abstract": "To address USSOCOMs need for a system to detect, locate, track, and either disable and\/or destroy a small unmanned aerial system (SUAS) from a distance, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop the new SUAS Killer, Identifier, and Tracker (SKEET) system. The SKEET system is based on a new design that combines state-of-the-art airspace monitoring technology utilizing compact scanning radar with novel passive RF scanning for rapid identification and discrimination from false targets. Innovations in accurate, high-speed tracking will enable fire control augmenting system data to be generated with enough fidelity to calculate dynamic, real-time firing solutions which can be fed to a motorized gimbal or to a weapons operator via heads up display or digital spotting scope. As a result, this system offers a tactical, ruggedized solution that provides effective countermeasures with sufficient standoff to allow for personnel to take appropriate offensive or defensive action. In Phase I, POC will theoretically demonstrate the feasibility of SKEET by conducting focused feasibility studies coupled with selected feasibility experiments to reach technology readiness level (TRL)-3. In Phase II, POC plans to refine the system design and produce a fully-integrated prototype to use for live demonstration against a SUAS, reaching TRL-6."

This will provide a framework to evaluate autonomous behavior strategies, such a safety, effectiveness, and robustness to manipulation. This work will enable surveillance operators to distinguish between uncertainty in RSO statethe more directly measurable quantities, and uncertainty in underlying intent.The proposed system will also enable assessment beyond what behavior is occurring, and speak to why in an operational sense, and quantitatively show the uncertainty of such categorizations. Understanding how intent is reflected in behavior and state space will also allow the detection of any technological gaps, the unobservable behavior space region where an RSO could hide its behavior or intent. Framing the surveillance problem as a multiplayer game enables the use of Information Space Receding Horizon Control (ISRHC) to discover likely intent, as well as other reinforcement learning techniques, and allows for longer lookahead windows. This may allow for the identification of a variety of unexpected events, such as sudden break-ups, or aggressively evasive maneuvers."

        "abstract": "Earths outer radiation belt, which consists of electrons with hundreds of keV to MeV energies, is a highly dynamic and driven environment.The large variations in electron flux, if unaccounted for, can cause satellites that travel through this complex region to experience anomalous behavior ranging from temporary satellite outages due to electrostatic discharge events in system electronics to potentially catastrophic damage of important satellite instruments, which lead to complete mission failure.The environment a given satellite encounters throughout its life effects on the probability and modes of failure it may encounter.Even with a large deployment of satellites, it is practically impossible to create an array of satellites that can effectively provide a 3D picture of the radiation belts and to fully capture the physics necessary to accurately estimate energetic electron flux.An assimilated model, that combines both spacecraft data and physical modeling, is necessary to fill this role.Although previous models may simulate GEO and HEO electron fluxes relatively well, they do not include any drift physics, which is particularly important for LEO satellites. Our proposed model which includes radial diffusion, pitch angle diffusion, and azimuthal drift, serves as a better general purpose operational radiation belt model."

The approach will use the novel formulation of Auger recombination pioneered at U. Iowa which divides the electron-electron scattering process into electronic response properties with a given momentum and energy, that are then connected by the Coulomb interaction matrix element. This approach will be extended to intraband scattering for electron-electron relaxation, and supplemented by scattering cross-sections obtained from realistic dopants and defects, and also bulk and superlattice phonon calculations. The results will be verified by evaluating vertical and lateral transport in mid-wavelength infrared and long-wavelength infrared InAs\/InAsSb superlattices. Combined with the carrier recombination rates already available from this software the quantum efficiencies of these superlattices will be predicted."

This particular approach offers a potential material system for wavelength flexible, high-efficiency, surface-emitting mid-infrared sources with significantly reduced complexity, cost, and constraints on the growth layer sequence in comparison to Type II superlattice structures.

The effort falls into three major thrusts.First, we propose a systematic evaluation of the symptoms and measures used to study hypoxia.Second, we focus on the development of system for supporting the use of multimodal data.This involves not only supporting the processing of raw data, but also methods for aligning data collected from different sources and across different time-courses.Finally, we set forth standards, methods, and experimental designs for evaluating the hypoxia test battery. This general metric evaluation design aid leverages statistical and machine learning approaches to identify valid, reliable, and practical measures for inclusion in test batteries. In pursuing these three thrusts, the Griffon Tool Suite aims to offer a test battery, a support tool for using that test battery, and a flexibility for adapting that test battery to apply to the measurement of different conditions affecting human performance in extreme environments."

While these methods are robust and have well characterized errors, Runge-Kutta methods have limitations for high-resolution federated simulations. These limitations include extensive computational throughput requirements and large output data sets. Other limitations include the need to perform time-step matching between component simulations, and to determine the states for federated simulation events between the calculated time-steps.Our approach helps mitigate all of these difficulties with traditional missile trajectory representations based on time-stepped position and orientation data.Approved for Public Release | 18-MDA-9522 (23 Feb 18)"

        "abstract": "High-fidelity trajectory propagators are fundamental to the simulation and analysis of launch vehicles, missiles, and satellites. Applications in fields ranging from missile threat analysis to flightpath optimization seek fast and accurate solutions to large numbers of trajectories in federated simulation environments. Due to their robustness, well-known properties, and straightforward implementation, most trajectory simulators use standard numerical integrators. However, the low computational and memory efficiency of standard integrators often limits the scope and complexity of the problems they consider. Recently developed multi-stage, multi-derivative Hermite-Birkhoff-Taylor methods couple Taylor Series and Runge-Kutta methods and achieve superior computational efficiencies compared to standard integrators. A straightforward extension of these methods based on Hermite interpolation yields smooth, piecewise polynomial expressions for the solution with tunable accuracies and storage requirements. Nanohmics proposes to collaborate with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory managed by the California Institute of Technology to investigate extensions of Hermite-Birkhoff-Taylor methods to efficiently solve and store vehicle trajectories in high-throughput, federated simulation environments. Numerical experiments on simple 3-DoF space launches will compare the computational performance of prototype implementations with those of standard propagators. Experimental results will be extrapolated using numerical analysis to identify computationally efficient extensions suitable for 6-DoF trajectories based on high-fidelity models.Approved for Public Release | 18-MDA-9522 (23 Feb 18)"

        "abstract": "The Department of Defense uses large-scale high-resolution federated simulations to propagate rocket vehicle trajectories. Runge-Kutta methods have served as a de-facto standard while conducting such simulations. However, there are several challenges while using Runge-Kutta methods for this task. Firstly, there should be exact time-step matching between federates, otherwise the states have to be interpolated between time steps, further introducing errors. Secondly, Runge-Kutta methods requires extensive computational throughput which in-turn increases the data output size. Thirdly, rocket vehicles follow different dynamics at different stages of its trajectory. Runge-Kutta integration schemes incur large integration errors at instances when change in dynamics occur. The proposed work develops a new class of structure preserving algorithms which inherently addresses all these limitations. Constants of motion are preserved throughout the rocket trajectory ensuring better error control at integration points and allowing larger time-steps, thus reducing output data. Moreover, a structure preserving interpolation method is proposed ensuring that the in-between states follow laws of physics obeyed by the underlying dynamical system. Phase I will demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed algorithms. In Phase II, a prototype will be developed to run multiple federated simulations.Approved for Public Release | 18-MDA-9522 (23 Feb 18)"

LMSSC manufactures a space cryocooler that already meets most of the solicitation goals, with the exception of the desired power efficiency; this provides an excellent starting point with a high probability of success on this STTR program for our innovative microvascular technology.Cryocooler efficiency can be greatly improved with better regenerator materials, and with an improved compressor motor configuration. The regenerator material can be tailored to a wide variety of cryocooler temperatures, and offers improved efficiency for every cryocooler made by LMSSC.The performance benefit derived from lower flow friction in the regenerator has been experimentally demonstrated to provide a 20% efficiency enhancement in a single-stage pulse tube cooling at 125 K. This Epoxy Resin Circular Hole (ERCH) regenerator will be low cost, high performance material beneficial for every cryocooler.Likewise, the enhanced motor configuration will provide higher efficiency for all cryocooler applications.Approved for Public Release | 18-MDA-9522 (23 Feb 18)"

In Phase 1 we will scale up a design currently in development for NASA to meet the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) topic requirements. Our approach achieves extreme miniaturization by operating at very high frequency (~200 Hz) while employing a well-established, high efficiency space cryocooler architecture, namely an active Stirling with motor-driven displacer. Termed the SSC-X because this version is larger than the 200 mW @ 80K NASA variant, initial modeling results indicate that the MDA version of the SSC will provide 2.3W heat lift at 110K for 17.6 WDC bus power at 300K warm end, all packaged with electronics and cryocooler mount within a 500 cc volume.Approved for Public Release | 18-MDA-9522 (23 Feb 18)"

For these reasons, thin-ply composites hold the potential for reducing the structural mass of the GMI interstages through increased structural efficiency.In the proposed effort, Materials Research &amp; Design (MR&amp;D) will team with Southern Research Institute (SR) and Orbital ATK to demonstrate the feasibility of replacing the current interstages of the GMI with a thin-ply composite.Approved for Public Release | 18-MDA-9522 (23 Feb 18)"

Recently, MDA has sought technologies to improve the performance of the booster vehicle (BV). To date, studies have shown that reductions in weight have a direct impact on overall effectiveness. The current proposal aims to Design for Additive Manufacturing (DfAM) by structural optimization and material selection to reduce the weight of existing components while meeting design specifications.Physical and environmental requirements will be considered in conjunction with manufacturing, storage, and operation expenses.Initially, the team will evaluate candidate parts (nozzles, brackets, y-joints, etc.) and material systems (steel, titanium, inconel, glass composite, etc.) best suited for light-weighting. A single component will be selected for optimization and AM fabrication. Simulation of AM build will assess sensitivity of material and process parameters in order to define an optimized approach to fabrication.The virtual component will be subjected to virtual testing to assess the fidelity of the model and support design optimization.Finally, an optimized AM component will be fabricated and subjected to service loads and compared in terms of weight and performance to a traditional fabricated part.Approved for Public Release | 18-MDA-9522 (23 Feb 18)"

These types of systems are commonly employed on fixed wing and rotorcraft platforms. The first expected use of this technology will be on the H-60 platform as part of a lightweight electronics enclosure. Mentis Sciences, Inc. and the University of New Hampshire will establish the feasibility for the design of an extremely light weight thermal management system with a focus on removing heat from the systems laser head using thermoacoustic heat pipes and lightweighting other components of the system. In previous work Mentis and UNH teamed up for the development of an extremely lightweight, modular electronics enclosure. The enclosure is designed to be mounted from a BRU-14 or BRU-65, as found on many Navy applications, including the H-60 helicopter. The entire pod is cooled using a vapor-compression system to maintain an internal temperature of 655 degrees F The team will leverage this work to demonstrate the feasibility of the system through modeling as well as by manufacturing representative thermoacoustic heat pipes."

        "abstract": "The objective of this program is to develop and demonstrate a flexible and efficient cooling system (FECS) for helicopters and other aircraft. FECS can be used to cool lasers, electronics or other devices in slow or fast-moving aircraft that are operating in high ambient temperatures. It utilizes a modular approach that allows FECS to be quickly and easily modified for various payloads. There are three main enabling technologies: a multi-function cold plate \/ evaporator (CPE), compact efficient compressor, and an intelligent and adaptive control system. The evaporator can be configured in many ways by the operator in the field, depending on the desired cooling interface. The FECS utilizes a variable speed positive displacement compressor that can change its speed and reduce its electrical power draw to the minimum needed to provide the cooling required while holding a precise temperature setting. Key features of the control system are adjustable operating parameters, i.e. compressor, fan, and pump speed, and aperture setting; and, adding supplemental cooling loops to the system for a range of equipment cooling options.These components will be integrated into the FECS to meet the needs of the Navy."

        "abstract": "The Thermoelectric coolers (TECs) are solid-state devices with no moving parts that provide reliable cooling power compared to traditional cooling systems such as vacuum compressors. However, their relatively high cost and low coefficient of performance (~ 0.5) have relegated them to niche applications such as small-scale portable coolers and, have yet, to be competitive from an efficiency standpoint with large-volume conventional cooling technologies. Recent improvements in TE device performance along with novel architectures in the form of a large-area, conformal TEC provide a means to manufacture larger-size spread coolers that can transfer significantly more heat (~ kW) with higher efficiency (COP~2.0) at a reduced cost compared to the tiling of rigid, ceramic-plate TECs. The novel TEC design can cool 2 kW of heat from a laser enclosure and permit the laser head temperature to be maintained at 10C and an enclosure temperature at 25C. Large-area conformal, solid-state TEC devices will be more reliable and consistent compared to conventional cooling systems such as vacuum compressors and Rankine coolers."

The approach enables conformal geometry that permits the laser cooling system to be designed around available space in the equipment bay. The proposed novel compact laser head cooling system with unprecedented efficiency will enable both future and current aircraft laser systems to occupy the smallest volume possible, and acquire, transport, and reject waste heat from the laser systems. The viability of the proposed design will be demonstrated by a 3D additively printed laser cooling head coupled with a commercial water chiller compressor. This laboratory prototype is scaled-down in the Phase I version. A completed system that meets all the requirements will be built and extensively tested in Phase II."

Currently, there is no viable GaN technology to realize large-area and low-defect substrates simultaneously. The technology producing 6&quot; and larger GaN wafers results in defect densities as high as 1e9 cm-2 whereas the technology achieving defect densities of 1e5 cm-2 or less can only provide 2&quot; wafers. To solve this dilemma, SixPoint Materials and UC Santa Barbara will explore both a tiling method (lateral crystal fusing) and a layer transfer method, to develop high-quality 4&quot; GaN engineered seed crystals suitable for SixPoint&apos;s proprietary near equilibrium ammonothermal (NEAT) method, which can achieve dislocation density of 2 x 1e5 cm-2 or less. The Phase I effort will focus on proof of concept with 10 x 20 mm seeds. During the Phase I option period, 2&quot; engineered seeds will be achieved. By the end of Phase II, this project will achieve 4&quot; GaN substrates with defect densities lower than 1e5 cm-2 and accelerate the wide adoption of vertical GaN power devices in both military and civil applications."

These are the three most critical requirements for military, aerospace and many commercial applications. In this STTR program, Qrona Technologies will collaborate with the University of Central Florida to develop low-cost and high-yield thin-film deposition and wafer transfer technologies to fabricate ultra-low defect III-nitride device structures grown on bulk GaN substrates. The proposed process reclaims and reuses the high quality bulk GaN wafers to achieve low-cost production of reliable GaN power devices with higher performance than the current state-of-the-art for both the government and commercial applications. As a demonstration of the effectiveness of the proposed approach, high current Schottky diodes will be fabricated in the Phase-I and Phase-I Option projects."

        "abstract": "Alloys of aluminum in the 7000 series are known to have good weight, strength, and fatigue properties and are commonly used in Naval aircraft components. Recent manufacturing trends are increasingly focused on additive manufacturing (AM) methods as a way to reduce lead time, cost, and to improve part performance. Current additive manufacturing techniques are unable to fabricate parts in 7000 series aluminum alloys due to a lack of ideal thermal control to prevent defects. To address this, Optonicus proposed the use of an adaptive fiber-array laser system as the energy source for Laser Additive Manufacturing of Seven Thousand Series Aluminum Alloy Components (LAM-STAAC). Integration of this multi-beam laser source into a powder bed fusion system will provide flexibility in controlling the laser intensity distribution on the powder bed material. This will allow enhanced control of the thermal gradients during material processing to generate components that cost less, perform better, last longer, is lighter weight and cannot be manufactured any other way."

In Phase I we expect to demonstrate the feasibility of our comprehensive approach and identify all the inputs and outputs necessary for the aircraft verification system software.

Where possible, the team will compare the performance of multiple technologies for printing a single material, to have a basis for comparing the advantages and disadvantages of each approach. In the Phase I option period, fundamental research studies will seek to expand the materials palette and deposition capabilities of ADM by establishing printing protocols for metals and polymeric materials that have not been previously reported for ADM.

To maximize compatibility, these libraries implement rarely used features that increase attack surface. Examples include the SSL Heart Beat feature (HeartBleed) and weak SSH ciphers (LOGJAM).The Navy would like to reduce software attack surface by removing unused protocol features. Our proposal, LeastProtocol, aims to develop a means to identify and eliminate features from existing software binaries. We will base our feature removal and identification research on two techniques: monitored execution and differential slicing. Multiple research papers have demonstrated that monitored execution combined with statistical techniques can map coarse protocol features to implementation code. Differential slicing compares two program executions and identifies locations where execution differs, enabling precise feature identification.For Phase 1, we will implement a proof of concept that works on a single protocol and implementation. The protocol and implementation will be of a real, deployed protocol but limited to open source software that runs on x86 Linux. We envision LeastProtocol will accept a protocol specification, a list of features, and a program binary. The tool will output a new binary that speaks the same protocol sans unwanted features."

Traditionally, the Navy subscribes to a blanket adoption of a standard protocol &quot;as is&quot;. Unnecessary features are active and can be accessed by both internal and external systems creating security vulnerabilities. PJR Corporation&apos;s (PJR&apos;s) Phase I STTR Proposal, in partnership with the University of Michigan (UM), seeks to automatically customize or subset the protocols to allow only necessary functionality. PJR and UM intend to reverse the trend toward one-size-fits-all protocols by enabling end users to selectively remove features they do not use or want. Examples of protocol features could include support for legacy functionality or a feature that is made unnecessary by a feature in another layer. The primary objectives of the proposed Phase I work is to research, validate, test, and demonstrate approaches to resolving higher risk technical challenges to automatically identifying and removing targeted features from common protocols. UM will continue it&apos;s research of machine learning to protocol feature analysis and discovery, as well as mapping required features to binary\/source methods. PJR will research and evaluate approaches to automated code modification\/transformation."

To address this challenge, Soar Technology (SoarTech) and the GeorgiaTech Research Institute (GTRI) propose Twiner, an intelligent system that aggregates very large sets of heterogeneous data, correlates them to detect causal relationships and displays both the data and its relationships in a way that enables novel cyberspace operations. Our goal is to allow users to find interesting entities and events and, by selecting them, to see how they are intertwined with others, thereby creating a dynamic, multi-layer map of cyberspace. Twiner will require us to develop novel anomaly detection and large-scale correlation techniques for which our machine learning (ML) expertise is ideally suited. However, since these deductive ML techniques alone are insufficient to establish causation, we will pair them with an abductive reasoning engine. Abductive reasoning starts from a set of observations and finds the likeliest explanation for them using behavioral models. Twiners engine will use Soar cognitive agents and a custom model library."

        "abstract": "Providing effective cyber defense for the DoD is compounded by the fact there is not a single physical or logical entity that defines cyberspace. In reality, DoD networks are often composed of three disparate but interacting layers: a physical layer that defines the structure of the network (e.g., computers and routers), a logical layer that represents the static or dynamic state of data within the physical layer (e.g., data accesses and modifications), and a human layer that describes the users and their interactions with each other and the other layers (e.g., project teams). Existing cyber defense solutions often only target malicious or anomalous activities within a single layer, and thereby neglect patterns, behaviors, or anomalies that may span multiple layers and indicate malicious behavior. To address this technological gap in cyber defense, Charles River Analytics proposes to design and demonstrate Layered Inference for Cyber Network Knowledge Synthesis (LINKS). This powerful tool uses real-time data to infer a multi-layer event graph and extracts complex normal and anomalous patterns across the layers of cyberspace. Ultimately, LINKS will enable cyber defenders and analysts to visualize and understand the complexity of cyberspace and more effectively respond to cyber threats."

These can be grouped into three layers: Physical, Logical, and Cyber-persona layers. Securing and protecting such complex and dynamic cyberspace resources and services are grand challenges. This project aims at developing a multi-layer anomaly behavior analysis of all components associated with each cyberspace layer and how they interact with each other in order to achieve superior capabilities in characterizing their normal operations and proactively detect any anomalous behavior that might be triggered by malicious attacks. In this project, we will develop a Multi-Layer Anomaly Behavior Analysis (MLABA) technology that is a true alternative to the existing security technologies. Our methodology to develop the proposed MLABA is based on a holistic approach that will continuously monitor, analyze, and diagnose the operations of all cyberspace layers in an integrated manner. For each layer, we will develop innovative data structures that can be used to accurately characterize the normal behavior of a resource, application or user to integrate the behavior of each layers to overcome the main limitations of anomaly behavior analysis and take proactive actions to stop cyberattacks propagation."

These technologies will include physical and video odometry for tracking distance traveled over the hull of the vehicle, as well as an automatic tether deployment and retraction system for controlling the amount of tether deployed. The tether deployment system will limit deployed tether to help avoid entanglements and excess drag on the vehicle, as well as providing a controlled operating envelope for the positioning technologies to work within. During Phase I, KCF and research partner Penn State will perform candidate sensor qualification and modeling to assemble the necessary hardware and software capabilities for autonomous hull navigation. During Phase II, KCF will engage with ROV manufacturing partner VideoRay LLC to build a working prototype autonomous hull-grooming system. Testing will be performed in a realistic field environment to confirm functionality. KCF is uniquely qualified for this topic due to its considerable experience in underwater navigation, ruggedized industrial device design, and ROV hardware integration."

        "abstract": "The objective of this proposed effort is to develop a highly autonomous hull-grooming system that can be operated easily and cost-effectively with minimal supervision. This system will meet the rigorous standards of current manned-grooming operations using a rotating brush tool and will ensure complete coverage of the groomed area by providing on-hull positioning accuracy of 0.15m. We will develop this system initially for use on DDG-51 class destroyers as well as both Freedom and Independence-variant Littoral Combat Ships though due to the tremendous commercial potential for such a capability, we will also design for multi-purpose ship grooming use. Building on the significant developments already realized for on-hull underwater vehicles, vehicle-to-hull attachment methods, tooling, and grooming methodologies, our research will focus on providing an accurate navigation, control, and operations scheme to these existing capabilities. Our proposed technical approach is based on the development of a multi-modal aided Inertial Navigation System (INS) specifically for hull-relative orientation, localization, and navigation combined with a proven autonomous control architecture for miniature water-borne robots and an intuitive mission-planning, quality assurance, and visualization Human Machine Interface (HMI) for supervising the hull grooming robot."

        "abstract": "The underpinning science and sensing associated with autonomous navigation is advancing on numerous fronts. The navigation capability required for ship hull grooming in a low visibility environment is a natural application of this technology. Enormous benefit will be realized in the public and private sectors of the shipping industry. The economic and environmental impact realized using proactive ship hull grooming will benefit society through reduced fuel cost, reduced greenhouse gas emission, and reduction in the transport of aquatic invasive species. The process of autonomously navigating a crawler on a ship hull will take advantage of the constrained nature of this motion and the closed form surface of the hull. Inertial, acoustic, and optical sensors will support the application of simultaneous localization and mapping methods (SLAM) optimized for this sparse feature environment. Methods of initial mission planning, and re-routing when confronted by obstacles, will allow for the grooming of an unknown hull. The results of the initial grooming will provide a baseline model of the hull for further review and mission planning, which will be utilized in the numerous future grooming cycles on that hull."

It is the Navys goal to develop an active EO\/IR imaging system that jointly optimizes illumination source properties and implements advanced image processing to improve performance and operational range of current technology. Optonicus proposes the Control and Optimization of Multiple Illumination Characteristics (COMIC) of a Pulsed Fiber Array Laser System for Active Imaging Through Fog system as a solution for increased situational awareness, target identification and recognition and target tracking in the presence of dense maritime fog. The COMIC system utilizes a novel pulsed fiber laser array illuminator to allow for optimization of wavelength, pulse shape and coherence, polarization and combined beam illumination profile to provide a ten-fold improvement in operational range over current active imaging systems in degraded weather conditions. In addition, GPU-based wave optics modeling of fog based on current weather conditions can provide a measure of image degradation from forward scatter and attenuation. Subsequent real-time image processing will allow removal of PSF image blur due to dense fog improving target identification, recognition and tracking."

Coherent range, Doppler, and polarization selective digital holography (DH) will be investigated for isolating the coherent direct ballistic photons received from the target from the incoherent scattered photons that lead to large background, decreased contrast, and image blurring. Coherent polarimetric imaging will be investigated to improve the reach of the DH imaging systems. To cue the narrower field-of-view DH imaging system with target location and Doppler tracking needed to maintain long coherence times, Blackmores high resolution, coherent FMCW scanning lidar system will be utilized and optimized for operation in marine fog environments. In addition, the photon link budgets for active imaging through fog with coherent imaging technology will be validated with fog tunnel and natural fog tests using this mature system, providing high confidence models for the design of a Phase 2 prototype system. Fog measurements will include extinction, absorption, and scattering in different fog conditions."

Their unique ability to operate independent of surface vessel conditions allows oceanographic seawater measurements when traditional means is not possible. Historically sensor packages for UUVs have been based on adaptions of ship deployed equipment. Recent development in sensors, such as the Hybrid Flow Through Conductivity sensor developed under prior Navy STTR supported programs are still being field evaluated, and continue to look to have an impact on improving CTD persistence especially in the UUV, and Float applications. However, while such evaluations are ongoing, this topic offers the opportunity to look industrial developments which can be applied to those traditional sensors and new industrial sensors and their application to oceanographich measures. These new sensors can change sensor deployment strategies such that advances in long term stability and deployment platform persistence can be attained. Single use disposable sensors have the potential to eliminate effects of biological growth degradation of conductivity measurement performance. Additionally, new technologies applied to existing sensors can dramatically reduce cost. The team includes two groups with demonstrated ability to deliver innovation solutions to oceanographic physical property of seawater measurements."

Currently there are no sensors capable of recording data such as dust composition, particle size distribution, total mass, etc. and have sufficient durability for flight conditions. Lynntech and Texas A&amp;M University propose to develop a sensor system based on a spectroscopic method integrated with a tunable size classification technique for real-time characterization of particles. During the Phase I project, characterization of standard test dust particles will be performed to identify and quantify CMAS constituents and other species such as NaCl. Particle analysis will be performed with single composition particles as well as standard test dust. Lynntech will engage with experts from the aerospace industry and within NAVIR to discuss sensor specifications and integration with an engine platform. During the option period of the Phase I project, volcanic ash simulants will be analyzed using the sensor system and functioning of the size classification technique will be demonstrated. During Phase II, the sensor system will be validated and optimized close to near-engine velocities on a test rig at Lynntech. Optimization of the sensor system design and its packaging into a ruggedized breadboard unit is also envisioned."

        "abstract": "Particle ingestion can be a significant issue for military aircraft with gas turbine engines. Ingested particles can erode or foul engine components such as cooling holes, accelerating engine wear, and decreasing service intervals. To better understand engine wear, and to plan service intervals, the Navy is interested in developing sensors that can measure particle loading in real time onboard operational gas turbine engines. Ingested particles may include sand, dust, salt spray, or even volcanic ash. Particles with high melting temperature, such as quartz, may fully transit the engine when ingested. Particles with low melting points can melt in the engine and stick to cool engine surfaces. For this reason, the composition and melting temperature of the particles is of significant interest. We propose to develop a novel sensor technology capable of measuring particle size, loading, and composition onboard an aircraft. The sensor is inherently compact and lightweight, and does not require probes or sampling tubes that interact with the flow. In Phase I, we will evaluate and apply a novel approach for classifying particles in the laboratory. In Phase II, we will develop and demonstrate a prototype flight sensor for measuring particle size, loading, and composition."

        "abstract": "The objective of this project is to develop a hybrid, multifunctional composite material that improves the thermal and chemical stability, and surface durability of traditional carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites. By using a standard prepreg lay-up process, in which a flexible conductive ceramic thin layer is bonded directly onto the outmost layer of polymer composites to ensure the material integrity, a hybrid composite will be manufactured following the same procedure as standard CFRP composites without increasing extra manufacturing cost. The prepreg lay-up manufacturing steps to produce such a hybrid multifunctional composite material are listed as below: (1)spray release agent on the tooling surface; (2)apply the flexible thermally-conductive ceramic composite layer on the tooling surface over release agent; (3)prepreg multiple layers of carbon fiber sheets over the flexible ceramic composite layer; (4)co-cure the hybrid composite using the standard autoclave method. The produced hybrid composites can be used in harsher environment, (e.g., high temperature, moisture under load, ultraviolet radiation, corrosive chemicals). The manufacturing procedure is readily scalable. During experiment, we will implement process optimization\/control during scale-up (size and geometric complexity) from coupon size to full-scale article according to application requirements."

        "abstract": "Accurate oceanographic sensing of temperature, salinity, velocity, noise, and turbidity is important to broad scientific, commercial, and military applications. The subsurface environment directly affects animal migration, sonar propagation, global weather patterns, and the primary productivity that underlies the ocean food chain. Most current methods for subsurface sensing require stationing of a research vehicle at each measurement point, resulting in limited spatial resolution, short observation periods, and high cost. An inexpensive, long-duration, three-dimensional sampling platform is needed. Creare, together with our research institution partner, the University of California, propose to develop a Bio-inspired Profiling Float to fill this unmet need. The Bio-inspired Profiling Float adapts a proven autonomous underwater platform to this mission through the addition of a jellyfish-inspired lateral propulsion mechanism and energy harvesting technologies. The integration of lateral propulsion in addition to the host platforms existing buoyancy control, will allow any individual Bio-inspired Profiling Float to drift along at a programmed depth profile or maintain station depending on mission requirements. Energy harvesting allows for unconstrained mission durations providing detailed, three-dimensional sensing with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution."

        "abstract": "Friction stir welding (FSW) is an attractive joining method where high strength low porosity welds can be attained. However, the high temperatures and forces required for welding high strength materials like steel require the use of exotic tools. Cubic boron nitride (cBN)-based tools offer attractive tool wear characteristics in steels, but are very costly. Conversely, refractory metal alloys are moderately less expensive, but offer poorer wear properties. A potential economical solution is to apply cBN-based onto affordable metallics tools. Claddings containing cBN+binders deposited by plasma spray onto the wear surface of tools have the opportunity to reduce cBN volume thereby reducing tool cost while maintaining the wear rate of monolithic cBN-based tools. The proposed Phase I STTR will investigate plasma spray deposition of cBN-based materials. Liquid forming phases will be incorporated with cBN to avoid cBN sublimation. Thermodynamic computations by STTR partner, University of Alabama, will guide selection of these liquid forming phases. Promising deposits will be exposed to typical FSW temperatures. The University of Alabama will characterize claddings pre- and post-thermal exposures to identify phase stability. Follow-on efforts will encompass deposition trials onto a FSW tool and welding trials at the University of Alabama."

Although naval platforms networks and communication suites have evolved significantly in the past few years to support such required connectivity, one of the greatest technical challenges still facing the military community is the processing of huge amounts of information, determining what is important from it, and how to get it to the right person at the right time.The overall objective of the Information-based Norms on Flow, Operations and Traffic Over Networks (INFOTON) program is to build a prototype framework to model and analyze the dynamic communication network and information flow between set of agents (sensors, platforms, units) communicating over the IoT. The system will be applicable to the spectrum of communication and control paradigms (e.g., centralized, locally centralized, decentralized, etc.) and leverage military simulators to define realistic operational scenarios. INFOTON will help characterize the impact to measures of performance as a function of agents&apos; processing of information, sparsity of reports given the conditions of the environment, available bandwidth, and the value of the information flow (communication volume) that is present in the IoT over time."

As such, extraordinary physical and mental demands are placed upon them to excel in extreme environments for extended periods of time. This unrelenting cycle of combat deployments and intense pre-deployment training shortens the functional life of operators, a highly undesirable outcome. Rejuvenate Bio developed a gene therapy platform that identified genes that can increase the stress-resistance, health and lifespan of mice as well as mitigate three different age-related diseases (heart failure, diabetes and obesity). We believe that these novel gene therapies will also enhance performance due to their modulations of stress responses and metabolic energy pathways. As a first step toward developing therapies for humans, we propose to measure the effect of these gene therapies on endurance, speed of recovery, and resistance to muscle damage. Completion of this Phase I study will enable us to begin Phase II testing of these therapies ability to enhance performance in a large animal model (canines). Using aging as a model to discover performance enhancing genes will allow for increased performance now and far into the future."

        "abstract": "Face recognition performance using deep learning has seen dramatic improvements in recent years. This improvement has been fueled in part by the curation of large labeled training datasets with millions of images of hundreds of thousands of subjects.This results in effective generalization for matching over pose, illumination, expression and age variation, however these datasets have traditionally only focused on visible spectrum imageryCovert face recognition for the warfigher requires matching non-visible spectrum imagery against watch-lists derived from current visible facial databases.However, it would be impractical to collect non-visible training datasets at the scale necessary for end-to-end training.In this proposal, STR, and university partner Northeastern University, will investigate cross-modal transfer learning by applying domain transfer techniques for matching a visible face representation to low-light and night-time sensor data.The STR team will collect a cross-spectrum biometric dataset from LWIR\/MWIR\/NIR sensors in support of a feasibility study on this cross-modal transfer learning capability, leveraging the STR Janus face matcher for baseline performance evaluation."

        "abstract": "Bulk InAs(x)Sb(1-x) is an infrared detector material that promises higher quantum efficiency than antimony-based superlattices in the longwave infrared (LWIR).This is due to the longer diffusion length of minority carrier holes in the bulk than in superlattices where they are localized.No native substrate exists for lattice-matched growth of InAs(x)Sb(1-x) material with LWIR bandgaps.So a key challenge is finding a suitable buffer that will minimize the crystal dislocation defects that will inevitably result from lattice-mismatched growth of InAs(x)Sb(1-x) on a substrate such as GaSb or GaAs.Such defects provide leakage paths and increase dark current.They also reduce minority carrier lifetime which reduces diffusion length and therefore quantum efficiency.Eliminating these defects is key to device performance.One solution is a suitable metamorphic buffer layer that filters out crystal dislocations and provides a template for the defect-free growth of the subsequent device layers.In Phase I, a QmagiQ-led team of device, material growth and material analysis experts developed such buffers and demonstrated high-performance focal plane arrays with cutoff wavelengths of 5 and 7 microns.In Phase II, we will build on this work and extend cutoff wavelength to the desirable 10-12 microns region."

        "abstract": "Optical cryocoolers, which are compact and produce no vibrations, are ideal for many electronics and sensor applications. In particular, some advanced metrology systems require cooling to around 124 K, the temperature at which the coefficient of thermal expansion for crystalline silicon goes through a null point. Currently, the dominant solid-state cooling technology is thermoelectric cooling, which uses the electrical Peltier effect. Despite decades of effort, the lowest achievable temperature for multi-stage thermoelectric coolers (TECs) is around 170 K. ThermoDynamic Films, LLC, together with it collaborators at the University of New Mexico (UNM) have been pursuing an alternative, approach to solid-state cooling technology, optical refrigeration. To date, the TDF\/UNM collaboration has cooled an optical-refrigerator from room temperature to 91 K with about 1% efficiency. This is the world record cooling for optical refrigeration (or any solid-state cooling technology). Under the STTR Phase II contract the TDF\/UNM team will build an optical cryocooler to be used to cool a crystalline silicon laser reference cavity. The TDF\/UNM team will build the cryocooler and adapt it to cool silicon mono-crystalline optical reference cavities."

        "abstract": "Under this Phase II effort, the design of a modular 60 kw (3.6 MJ) shock tolerant composite flywheel for backup\/ride through power will be finalized. This composite flywheel design will make use of a novel low cost thermal press cure process to fabricate the individual composite rings used to build up the flywheel. The manufacturing process parameters used in previous hydroburst testing of initial cylindrical large scale test coupons will be refined for fabrication of the flywheel banding. This program will also use the MiTi developed shock tolerant foil bearings to support the rotor system in a low ambient pressure environment. Upon completion of the composite flywheel design, the flywheel rings will be fabricated using the out of autoclave thermal press curing process. The individual bands will then be assembled into the test composite flywheel. Once fully assembled, MiTi will conduct spin tested to verify the structural integrity of the flywheel using the low cost thermal press curing manufacturing process."

        "abstract": "The objective of this project is to develop a portable and lightweight cyber forensics software toolkit with advanced capabilities for supporting live forensics on SCADA Machinery Control Systems (MCSs). The lack of standards, coupled with extensive reliance on proprietary solutions and protocols, essentially prevent the ready adoption and utilization of current forensic tools and methods. Additionally, the unique requirements of legacy and proprietary components, protocols, and the likes, within SCADA MCS, necessitate an open architecture design in order to functionally test various tool components to be integrated into the CyFT framework. Based on our Phase I feasibility study, we feel confident and encouraged to propose developing an Open Systems Architecture-based Cyber Forensics Toolkit (CyFT) Framework. Tools developed with cyber forensics capabilities can be seamlessly integrated into CyFT framework. Some of the key factors evaluated for suitability and feasibility of available alternatives for adoption during Phase II prototype implementation are as follows:1.Design Alternatives Modular vs Integral; 2.Solution ArchitectureClosed vs Open; 3.API SpecificationsOpen Standard vs Custom; 4.Evaluation ModelsFormal\/Abstract vs Simulation\/Prototype; and5.Tool ExecutionMemory Resident (e.g., Terminate &amp; Stay Resident (TRS)) vs Disk Resident."

During Phase I, we will develop a detailed design of the sun tracking radiometer, resulting in detailed specification for the antenna, radiometer, sun tracking pedestal, and external in situ sensors."

These tools will be applied to 2 years of GEO ephemeris data of active satellites at DF&amp;NN. The RDESB prototype will reduce the risk in rapidly discovering the behavioral patterns of potentially evasive and\/or ambiguous active resident space objects. RDESB will detect non-Keplerian behavior in ephemeris data for 2015 and then learn these normal behaviors with ANOM. ANOM application on the 2016 ephemeris will detect abnormal maneuvers, cross-tags, etc. which are tracked within Abnormality Detection Classification Viewer. The Smoking Gun tool will be extended to find temporal relationship correlations amongst these abnormal events. The ClassCat GUI will be extended to enable the user to create the Ontology-based Knowledge Graph for classification and relationship ontology labels of the abnormal signature detections to include confidences of alternative labels. The marked normal maneuvers (e.g., E\/W, N\/S, etc.) and relationship behaviors will be learned by sparse categorization NNs which automatically select the significant variables necessary. These sparse NNs flag 2016 abnormal and missed maneuvers and relationship precursors to create sensor tasking for increased sensor updates during times of predicted maneuvers and after these abnormality detections to achieve and maintain custody of UCTs."

Extremely small and precise geometries each containing a controllable number of dopants in a 2D array will create tunable electronic states and, we believe, strongly correlated quantum systems.The technology to create and measure these designed 2D materials is only just emerging. We will significantly improve the accuracy and scale of the arrays, develop reliable electrical contacts to permit transport measurements, develop other dopant options including acceptors and donors, and develop transport and other measurement processes to explore the quantum nature of these devices. This commercialization will put these capabilities into the hands of many quantum researchers."

CONCUR ingests both social media and archival data using an already developed tool, identifying key indicators of urban functions and potential disruptors. CONCUR quantifies these indicators importance to the environments stability and incorporates them into a conceptual ontology, characterizing the urban terrains ability to maintain stability and provide civil services and governance. CONCUR weighs the impact that these indicators and their causal inter-linkages have upon each other across time, and produces a resilience score, characterizing the urban environments fragility and forecasting its likelihood to become feral. CONCUR uses cutting-edge analytics to identify specific weaknesses in infrastructure and services and to identify emerging tipping points that could lead to instability and rapid system failure. CONCUR provides users both quantitative analytics as well as intuitive visualizations through an already developed insight-generating interface."

        "abstract": "Combat casualty handoffs are critical communication moments during which responsibility for the patient and important casualty information is transferred between providers. The nature of these handoffs requires specialized training, for which no standardized framework currently exists. The proposed effort aims to develop a capability, compatible with current DoD systems, that provides caregivers with the opportunity to master combat casualty handoff protocols, from the point of injury through the continuum of care. This solution, the Combat Casualty Handoff Automated Trainer (CCHAT), focuses on the verbal communication and proposes a speech recognition system that will automatically assess a trainees handoff performance in real-time.The proposed system will incorporate the speech protocol created by the DHA17B-002 performer. Using this protocol, trainees will perform a handoff in any simulated training environment. Their speech will be captured by the system and interpreted by the software. As the speech is interpreted, it is evaluated against the standardized speech protocol and populated in trainee and instructor user interfaces. These interfaces will provide in-situ performance feedback and AAR metrics. This effort will develop a TRL3 prototype system and demonstrate feasibility of speech recognition for handoff training."

        "abstract": "Approximately 70% of sentinel events in medical care are related to communication mishaps, and despite regular and frequent occurrence, an even higher percentage (80%) of severe medical errors are related to miscommunication during handoffs (i.e., the transferring of information, responsibility, and authority for patient care from one provider to another). The TiER1 team proposes to address challenges related standardized handoff protocols, validation of those protocols, and transfer of evidence-based approaches to the field. To address these challenges, we propose to develop the Effective Combat Casualty Care Handoff Operations (ECCCHO) system. Three components comprise the ECCCHO system: (1) The Toolkit including mnemonics and a digital Tactical Combat Casualty Care (TCCC) Card to ensure the right elements accompany a handoff; (2) The Methoddrawn from team performance research and applications, current best practices in patient handoffs, and TiER1s approach to addressing performance and organizational gaps in Fortune 500 companies; and (3) Outcome measures against which methods and elements of handoff protocols can be evaluated. The Toolkit will include what (required elements) to communicate as specified by DHA Procedural Instruction Number 6040.01, and the Method will specify how (process) to communicate during handoffs throughout the continuum of care."

        "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) often occurs when a sudden trauma or head injury disrupts the function of the brain. Common causes of TBI include damage caused by explosive devices, falls and vehicle or motorcycle accidents. Sepsis is the result of a massive immune response to bacterial infection that gets into the blood. Sepsis often leads to organ failure or injury, and has always been a significant problem on the battlefield; infections ran rampant before the discovery of antibiotics. TBI has been called the signature wound of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. The US Department of Defense, calculates over 360,000 soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines have suffered some form of TBI since the year 2000. Sepsis, while affecting a small proportion of military casualties, has a significant effect in increasing morbidity and mortality. Further, this disease often proceeds rapidly, and manifests itself in unpredictable ways. Ionica Sciences proposes to develop a multiplexed platform that targets biomarkers associated with sepsis and mild to moderate TBI. The Ionica Sciences assay combines target-specific DNA aptamers with Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) to rapidly and sensitively detect human biomarker protein tau for TBI and human procalcitonin for sepsis."

In addition, by applying a small voltage and current across the membrane, the oxygen production rate can be greatly increased.During Phase I, we intend to demonstrate 99% plus oxygen purity at a level of 15 liter\/minute\/sq-meterof membrane surface area, convert the configuration from our flat membrane cells to tubular membrane cells, which increases the support surface area.Building on the tubular membrane support technology, we also plan to develop a concept design for a 120 liter\/min oxygen pump targeted for military use. It is anticipated that during a Phase II a 120 liter\/min oxygen pump device can be demonstrated that will meet the military needs for a field hospital intensive care unit."

Though there has been a large variety of research performed in trying to understand the problems and why theyre caused, there are inefficiencies due to the lack of standardized cross-laboratory protocols, procedures, and metrics. To address this challenge, Aptima and partners at The University of CaliforniaSan Diego propose to develop AeroQUEST (Aeromedcial Quantified Understanding via Experimental Standards Toolkit). AeroQUEST will be a distributed system enabling aviation medicine and human performance researchers to implement essential actions to design studies, execute study designs, and analyze collected data and results in a standardized fashion. The system will include a dynamic user interface that allows researchers to design, compare, and contrast current study designs with that of other labs, allow researchers to interface with a standardized set of sensors for data collection via the HPML standard, and allow researchers to analyze and disseminate data and study designs across laboratories as necessary. When complete, the AeroQUEST system will ultimately contribute to bolstering the fidelity and replicability of studies across laboratories, which will ultimately lead to the development of mitigation strategies for PEs of interest."

The TAP-LAM metal additive manufacturing system will advance strategic missile defense system testing capabilities by improving 3D printing methods to rapidly produce large-scale threat surrogate targets with identical material properties to those currently built with conventional, subtractive techniques. Through the use of proprietary multi-beam fiber-array laser systems the metal LAM material properties will be tailored to meet the strict tolerances required in high strain rate testing conditions. The proposed system will adapt high-power coherent fiber-array and adaptive beam control technologies originally developed for DoD directed energy applications. In Phase II, Optonicus will develop a fully functioning TAP-LAM-DED system, which will be used to quickly fabricate full and scaled test articles which will be delivered to MDA for further evaluation. Optonicus plans to commercialize this technology for DoD defense markets and civilian applications in Phase III.Approved for Public Release | 18-MDA-9522 (23 Feb 18)"

        "abstract": "This is a follow-on SBIR Phase II as a result of a fully executed SBIR Technology Transition Plan to transition MSIs COgnitive Stochastic MOdeling System (COSMOS) in a microsystem hardware to increase reliability of systems and components which would reduce maintenance and increase operational availability, which reduces the number of aircraft needed to complete missions. ACC and the AFRL propulsion division desire a new prognostic health management (PHM) approach that applies advanced cognitive diagnostic and prognostic algorithms to systems and components of vehicles operated under harsh or off-design conditions typical of military platforms. In Phase II of the SBIR to AF121-170, MSI developed, prototyped, and demonstrated a prototype PHM system that can provide accurate prognosis of propulsion system health and, as much as possible, preempt loss of control, in-flight shutdowns, and cut down on false removals and maintenance time caused by inadequate information from the aircraft. The demonstration included real time data collection, signal conditioning, cognitive Bayesian processing, offload via Ethernet, and probabilistic decision support information for maintenance troubleshooting assists. During the demonstration, simulated missions were seeded with faults that are typical of hard-to-isolate problems experienced in propulsion systems. COSMOS successfully identified the seeded faults."

Instead of medical personnel waiting until the area is secure before approaching a casualty, a well coordinated robotic response can be launched, drastically decreasing response times and potentially saving a life.To accomplish the stated objective, multiple unmanned systems (US) will be required to work together such that a single operator can control them in a very accurate and predictable manner.In addition, their movements must be synchronized and tied to a single frame of three-dimensional reference to ensure their end effectors reach their commanded locations, navigation must be accurate, and austere terrain must be traversed with maximum safety and comfort afforded the casualty.The proposed effort meets the stated objectives by leveraging existing robotic technology and employing a novel applique kit to enable the use of any military robot with an arm and end effector."

There are a plethora of sensor types that should be integrated into such a system; however, COTS solutions in this field are generally proprietary and thus limited in compatibility from many perspectives.The UTC solution is a unified technology platform; a total solution that can be used for anything from testing new occupancy strategies to implementing automated HVAC controls.By building the foundation of this solution on an open-source, tested, interoperable framework, the UTC approach will deliver a solution that can detect and react based on pre-defined sensor patterns without compatibility or implementation limitations typical of existing COTS smart building packages.The UTC team, including UDRI, SlickLabs, Harbor Link, and Greenspace, has the BAS interoperability experience from previous efforts with AFCEC, experience with facility-related control systems (FRCS), and innovators in the occupancy sensing space."

        "abstract": "Automatic conversion of computer aided drafting (CAD) geometry to computational grids appropriate for high fidelity hypersonic analysis is needed. With respect to grid quality, the output must be purely hexahedral and C2 continuous, even at extraordinary vertices. To accomplish this, a pipeline of local and global CAD repair algorithms will feed into a feature-preserving quadrangulation module with optional adaptive surface refinement. Catmull-Clark subdivision surfaces will be iteratively aligned to the quadrilateral surface meshes to provide a lightweight parametric representation. Recent advances from the computer graphics community will be employed to assure C2 continuity at extraordinary vertices. These techniques map a C2 continuous polynomial onto the subdivision surface with a C2 continuous compact weight function. The result will be projected back into the UV space of the input CAD to enable geometric surface sensitivities. Proven quadrangulation algorithms will then be extended to 3D hexahedralization to enable the automatic generation of purely hexahedral volumetric grids. Similarly, 3D subdivision volumes will map hexahedra to continuous, lightweight parametric representations. An additional library will be created to discretize the parametric grids and push them directly into processor memory. Bypassing the hard drive in this way is essential for parallel scalability to billions of grid cells."

The Phase I effort focused on developing a wide and deep network algorithm using Industrial Product-Support Vendor (IPV) Gen II program for predicting the probability of failure. The proposed Phase II effort leverages the Phase I work and will focus on three main goals:(1) Inclusion of Bayesian networks to the existing wide and deep network algorithm to extract risk correlations;(2) Implementing a secure cloud based module for ingesting new data sources - weather, financial and event data;(3) Implementing an application that integrates the algorithmic and data sourcing components in an adaptive framework that can predict the likelihood of supply chain failure and identify the key risk factors that create those failures. Phase II will result in a software program that will adaptively gather relevant industrial supply data and provide an almost real time prediction of industrial risks.

        "abstract": "The Arctic is warming at a rate that is nearly twice the global average. Low, shallow, stratus clouds are persistent from spring through early winter in the Arctic and are strong contributors to warming and ice melt in the Arctic. These clouds allow visible sunlight to penetrate to the surface, but trap long- wave radiation emanating upwards from the surface. The result is a cloud blanket that warms the Arctic and promotes melting. The melting creates more open water, which is a better absorber of sunlight than ice, thereby facilitating a positive feedback that increasingly warms the Arctic. The Arctic stratus clouds are called mixed-phase clouds because they generally contain both supercooled water drops and ice crystals. Precise measurements of the size distributions of water drops and ice particle in mixed-phase clouds can only be accomplished by in situ instrumentation. Manned research aircraft used to make in situ measurements are expensive, have relatively short duration and pose safety risks for the crew. Safer, more efficient in situ measurements are needed. Addressing the Problem: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and tethered balloon systems (collectively UAS) offer significant advantages over manned research aircraft. They are capable of long-duration measurements of cloud properties in regions where piloted aircraft are unsafe, e.g., at very low altitudes over remote regions, such as tundra and open ocean. UAS are now widely recognized as a technology that can provide unprecedented insights into cloud and radiation processes, but development of miniature sensors capable of providing sophisticated measurements of cloud, aerosol and radiative properties lag behind. The DOE recently purchased a midsize UAV, called an ArcticShark, which will be used to collect data in Arctic mixed-phase clouds. The proposed research is to develop a combination optical particle probe that will be installed on the ArcticShark and make measurements of water and ice particles in Arctic mixed-phase clouds. Phase I: The company designed and performed feasibility laboratory tests on a state-of-the-art instrument, called a SharkEye, which combines three optical cloud particle probes in a small, lightweight (4 kg) instrument that can be installed on the DOE ArcticShark and tethered balloons. The SharkEye combines a scattering probe that measures the sizes of cloud particles from 2 to 50 microns, an optical array imaging probe with 5-micron pixel resolution and four gray levels, and a cloud particle imager that records high-definition images with 1-micron pixel resolution. The size resolutions of the optical array imaging probe and cloud particle imager are superior to all existing instruments and are unique to the field of in situ optical cloud particle probes. The SharkEye will collect unprecedented data in mixed-phase clouds, enabling it to precisely measure the water and ice size distributions. Laboratory tests in Phase I demonstrated the feasibility of fabricating a SharkEye capable of installation and successful operation on the ArcticShark in Phase II. Phase II: We propose to install the SharkEye on the DOE ArcticShark and conduct a pilot field project at the DOE\u2019s research site at Oliktok Point, Alaska. Collected data will be placed in the DOE archives and analyzed by company scientists. Anticipated results include improved radiative transfer retrievals and climate models. Anticipated Benefits and Commercial Applications: Long-term in situ measurements of the effects that clouds and aerosols have on climate in Polar Regions will improve the parameterizations of climate prediction models, giving scientists and politicians a better awareness of how to prepare for ice melt, habitat change, sea-level rise and the impact on coastal populations. UAV\u2019s are an emerging market that will eventually routinely monitor gases and aerosols in urban environments, thereby aiding in identifying statutory violators; aerosols and clouds that are generated from forest fires, and ash from volcanic eruptions that have a strong impact on aviation safety."

        "abstract": "Many atomic processes occur on timescales that are as short as tens to hundreds of femtoseconds. While pulsed lasers have the temporal resolution to investigate these processes, they cannot provide the requisite spatial resolution. Ultrafast electron diffraction (UED) and Dynamic transmission electron microscopy are pulsed electron techniques that have been recently developed to probe the dynamics of these processes with adequate spatial resolution. Unfortunately, electron-electron interactions increase the beam energy spread from a fraction of an electron-Volt to hundreds or even thousands of electron-Volts, which broad- ens both the temporal and spatial extent of the electron pulse. Consequently, there remains a strong de- mand for improving the temporal resolution of the probing pulse without sacrificing total pulse charge and spatial resolution. In this SBIR project, EOI is developing a UEM with atomic resolution, on the order of 3\u212b, and capable of reducing the pulse length into the sub-nanosecond range for single shot applications with up to 107 elec- trons\/pulse, and femtosecond temporal resolution for stroboscopic applications with thousands of elec- trons\/pulse. The key feature of this approach is the combination of a superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) gun and a novel electron column operating at 4 MeV. This approach has two major advantages: first, the acceleration to relativistic energies dramatically lowers the Coulomb effects due to electron-elec- tron interactions, which allows the use of significantly more electrons\/pulse; and second, it provides high temporal resolution that is accompanied by atomic scale resolution owing to a lens system with low aber- rations and SRF gun with low energy spread. During Phase I, EOI successfully completed simulations demonstrating the capability of the UEM column to produce a single shot with 10 million or more electrons in a sub-nanosecond pulse while maintaining atomic resolution. EOI drafted a set of candidate UEM architectures, evaluated the trade-offs between temporal and spatial resolution, and designed a column optimized for ultrafast microscopy applications. In this initial Phase II, EOI will produce a detailed opto-mechanical design of a core UEM column con- taining the critical optical components, i.e. the illumination optics and objective lens. EOI will work with Dr. Xijie Wang\u2019s group at SLAC to assemble the UEM column, integrate it with the SRF gun and verify experimentally the performance of the instrument. Without the magnifying power of the projection optics, the spatio-temporal resolution will be limited to approximately 50 nm - 100 ps in single shot mode. However, by inverting the orientation of the objective lens, the column can operate in selected area UED mode, probing regions as small as 10 nm with femtosecond temporal resolution. The full prototype with atomic resolution will be completed in a sequential phase II project. EOI\u2019s novel UEM column provides a path to a product targeted for emerging ultrafast applications, thus making it suitable for enhancing the study of the structure, composition, and bonding states of new mate- rials at ultrafast time scales to advance material science research in the field of nanotechnology and in particular in biomedical research."

        "abstract": "Ceramic matrix composites, or composites, allow for higher operating temperatures in nuclear reactors and provide improved accident tolerance. However, composites cannot be processed like metals and require joining techniques like brazing to obtain complex three-dimensional shapes. Brazing is not the ideal solution, as brazed joint material may not be chemically stable, hermetic, or neutron irradiation tolerant when compared to the base composite material. For example, preferential oxidation can occur due to the lower chemical stability of some brazed joints, resulting in a compromised composite structure.How the Problem is AddressedThis project uses commercially available arc welding technologies for the joining of silicon carbide based ceramics. Arc welding allows the application of heat at the joint, eliminating the need for large furnaces to heat the entire component being manufactured and joined. Sub-components can be fabricated and joined to form complex three-dimensional composite components for next generation nuclear applications.What was Done in Phase IArc welding parameters were developed to weld a silicon carbide-zirconium diboride-zirconium carbide ceramic, and solidification of the weld pool was analyzed. The flexure strength of the joined ceramics were shown to be comparable to current ceramic joining technologies, like brazing. Once arc welding parameters were established, arc welding was used to join flat plates to make a monolithic channel box. Arc welding of monolithics was then transferred to composites, fusion welding of ceramic composites was demonstrated.What is Planned for Phase IIArc welding of ceramics is a relatively foreign concept. In Phase II, the understanding of what can be done and how it can be accomplished will be increased through the welding of new ceramic compositions; weld behavior analysis, such as strength and corrosion resistance; to the modelling of the ceramic arc welding process. Moreover, the development of an autonomous ceramic welding system will increase precision and reliability. Ultimately, for successful acceptance and transition, joining of composites via arc welding techniques will continue to be developed, demonstrated, and refined.Commercial Applications and Other BenefitsThe high temperature tolerance of ceramic matrix composites could allow power upgrades in commercial reactors of as much as 30%, increasing the capacity of existing plants and saving ~$240 million over the lifetime of a plant. An economical, field-deployable welding method will enable robust joining technology that can be widely deployed for the fabrication of complex, three dimensional, silicon carbide based composites for use in Gen IV nuclear reactors."

Coating of existing accelerator vacuum tubes with compacted thick crystalline copper is a very cost effective way to mitigate significant problems in accelerators trying to increase luminosity. IAD results in superior quality film deposition, which due to inefficiencies, is presently restricted to high value items.

        "abstract": "A major problem facing the existing U.S. fleet of Light Water Reactor facilities is stress corrosion cracking of austenitic nickel and iron alloys, which comprise the bulk of wetted components in LWR facilities; up to 70% of wetted non-fuel areas in a typical facility, making this problem particularly widespread and especially prevalent with extended service life. Cold spray technology offers an effective solution to repair corrosion damage that can be applied at low temperature, therefore minimizing substrate heating, maintaining dimensional stability, and avoiding unwanted thermal effects (HAZ, thermal stresses, dilution layer formation, etc.). The repair will arrest crack growth, protect from further corrosion damage, and fully restore load carrying capacity of the component, and can be applied in-situ, eliminating the otherwise necessary component removal process. In phase I, the project team down-selected appropriate cold spray-able nickel powder materials, established baseline processing parameters, optimized the cold spray material deposition process, evaluated the structural properties of the repair, analyzed the corrosion resistance of the cold spray material, optimized the cold spray material through the development of post-deposition heat treatment, established working relationships with a LWR manufacturer, a DOE National Laboratory, and a large owner \/ operator, identified several target components for repair, established long term transition targets, and designed equipment modifications to enable in-situ repair within the LWR facility. The cold spray repair process can be applied at low temperatures, resulting in a material with exceptional structural properties that is more noble than 304L Stainless Steel or Alloy 600, which minimizes galvanic effects and prevents further corrosion at the repair site, making cold spray an ideal solution for structural repair in corrosive environments. The phase II project will implement design modifications allowing in situ repair, further develop cold spray processing parameters, surface preparation techniques, and repair geometry effects, and develop statistically assured material property data for future structural implementation efforts. Additional cold spray materials will be investigated for feasibility and applicability, and the cold spray material will be analyzed in greater detail, using elemental analysis, advanced mechanical testing techniques, and stress corrosion crack testing under relevant conditions. Finally, phase II will demonstrate a cold spray repair on a component supplied by a large owner \/ operator. This effort advances the state of the art in cold spray repair and develops the foundation for ASME code consideration, directly in line with the DOE\u2019s need for in situ mitigation and repair of corrosion damage in LWR\u2019s, offering owners \/ operators a cost-effective means of plant sustainment and reducing the overall maintenance burden of aging reactor components. This repair approach also improves the safety of LWR facilities, which provides both a benefit to the plant owner \/ operator, as well as the general public."

        "abstract": "The Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Nuclear Physics Research supports user facilities studying the physics of rare radioisotopes. The facilities produce sufficient quantities of rare radioisotopes to be studied and possibly used for new applications, including medical diagnostics and treatment. The DOE Office of Nuclear Physics Isotope Program supports the US supply of many important uncommon isotopes that require unique DOE capabilities for their production. Both the Nuclear Physics Research and Isotope programs necessarily involve unknown spatial distributions of radioisotope mixtures that cannot be readily observed by conventional nuclear-detection means. General Statement of How this Problem or Situation is Being Addressed The overall objective of the program is the development of a commercial Nuclear Physics (NP) Imager to provide high-resolution spectroscopic detection and imaging of uncommon and rare radioisotopes as they are processed. The NP Imager will provide quantitative visual data allowing the researcher to develop new processes faster, increase workflow efficiency and lower the radiation dose to personnel. What was done in Phase I? During Phase I, early existing gamma-ray imaging systems were taken to two different DOE isotope research and production facilities to measure the gamma-ray spectra, quantities and gamma-ray images of various isotopes as they were processed. The data from these measurements were used to design the NP Imager and new imaging modalities to be prototyped, developed and demonstrated during Phase II. What is planned for the Phase II project? Phase II will see the manufacture and evolution of several prototype NP-Imagers with new advanced gamma-ray imaging modalities to provide vastly improved sensitivity and resolution. These prototype imagers will be used to observe isotope processing at DOE facilities conducting rare and uncommon isotope research and production.\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits The NP Imager will naturally contribute to other DOE security-related fields including nuclear weapons non-proliferation, treaty verification, nuclear-explosion monitoring, nuclear materials holdup, nuclear safeguards and diagnostics. However, the NP Imager will be extremely useful to programs outside DOE producing large quantities of isotopes for specific medical procedures. In these circles, the technology developed here also sees a natural foray into nuclear-medicine treatment fields."

        "abstract": "Ethylene demand is expected to increase by 50% domestically and worldwide over the next 5 years with a scramble to increase supply via expansion or grass root facilities. US capacity will remain at about 20% of the world\u2019s supply and exceed 100 BPPY. To meet this challenge, US-DOE has invented a mixed metal oxide catalyst, M1 for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (C2-ODH) to ethylene at high conversions and very high selectivities. Yields which historically only reached about 50% per mass of ethane feedstock will now exceed 90% with the M1 catalyst (C2-ODH-m). The process, now exothermic and low temperature may be run in a packed bed with cooling. Other operating conditions are low pressures and residence times of several seconds. Overall Objective: Conventional recovery and purification of ethylene would include compression, chilling, and sizable distillation columns. These systems are capital and energy intensive. C2-ODH-m technology will require none of those unit operations, only requiring 3 major systems; a reactor, heat management, and an ethylene recovery system using membranes. Capital costs are much lower, estimated "

        "abstract": "There is an urgent need to significantly reduce CO2 emissions from coal burning power plants. Current CO2 capture technologies are too expensive and not economically viable. A new technology that can capture ~90% of the CO2 and significantly reduce the cost of capture is required for commercial viability. Statement of How this Problem is Being Addressed:This project is aimed at the development of an advanced algae technology that can enable 90% of the CO2 from coal based power plants to be captured and converted to liquid bio-fuels and other high value products. Generation of high value co-products creates substantial added revenue which can potentially reduce the net cost of CO2 capture to 80% CO2 capture from simulated flue gas was demonstrated using discrete components. The dewatering technology was advanced and a new membrane developed. Presence of key co-products validated.Plans for Phase 2 Project:In Phase2, the technology will be advanced and positioned for future testing in relevant environments. A lab scale pilot system to demonstrate the core technology for high efficiency carbon capture at high productivity will be built and operated. The new technology for dewatering will be advanced and membrane modules made. The technology for producing high value co-products will be demonstrated at lab scale. Techno-economic analysis will be refined.Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:Commercial applications of the new technology include CO2 capture from coal power plants and other fossil fueled industries, production of liquid bio-fuels, food and nutraceuticals. This will greatly reduce CO2 emissions and consumption of petroleum. About 99% of the water used is recycled thus greatly reducing fresh water consumption. By enabling the large new applications mentioned above, it can create new industries and jobs."

        "abstract": "This proposal addresses the challenge of measuring the hydrogeologic response of geologic formations in-situ and at high-resolution to determine flow and storage parameters governing groundwater availability, contaminant fate, and other dynamic subsurface processes. How this problem is being addressed: We will develop direct-push and borehole instrumentation and methods for efficiently acquiring high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data in the shallow subsurface. A novel high-resolution, ultra-slim sensor will be engineered for deployment in small-diameter direct-push rods. In addition to measuring the static NMR response, which conveys porosity, fluid mobility, and pore size, probes will be integrated with tooling for flow injection around the NMR tool to measure dynamic flow and saturation characteristics. Phase I Progress and Phase II tasks: The Phase 1 research successfully established the feasibility of the ultra-slim high-resolution NMR sensor, culminating in a working prototype senor. The feasibility of the novel flow injection methods was also demonstrated through meso- scale experiments in a test cell providing a borehole analog for NMR measurements paired with fluid injection. In Phase 2, we will commercialize the ultra-slim tool and develop a functional version of the tool embedded into direct push rods. Tooling and ancillary control systems will be engineered for dynamic flow measurements in boreholes and wells and we will demonstrate these methods at hydrogeologic test sites, DoE sites of interest, and on commercial projects. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: Completion of this technology in Phase II and beyond will deliver high-resolution dynamic NMR as a commercial product for sale, rental, and services in the booming subsurface characterization market. This technology will make it possible to efficiently and directly measure subsurface properties that have proven difficult to measure with existing methods. The newly forged capabilities will be of tremendous value to any company, government, or public agency engaged in contaminated site remediation, soil geotechnical analysis, groundwater resource evaluation, or critical zone research. Ultimately, the technology will benefit the global economy and human health, by enabling more effective understanding and management of the subsurface environment."

        "abstract": "Synchrotron light sources and X-ray free electron lasers are now generating shorter pulses with more intense light than ever before possible. The capabilities of these new sources grant unprecedented access into the workings of the natural world. X-ray detectors, as they currently stand, cannot accommodate the large dynamic range of collected x-rays in modern scattering experiments. This capability gap in the detector market leaves scientists unable to answer fundamental questions. Statement of how this problem is being addressed The proposed program will advance the development of a novel wide dynamic range x-ray mixed-mode pixel array detector conceived within a national laboratory. This mixed-mode detector has demonstrated single x-ray sensitivity with a dynamic range of greater than 108 photons per second per pixel with a read noise of 0.16 photons. The technology has evolved to the proof of concept phase and the proposed program will leverage the current developments at the national laboratory to transition the technology from prototype into a commercial instrument. What was done in Phase I During Phase I the technology of the proof of concept detector was transferred to the small business, who then evaluated and conceptually redesigned the system to a commercial robust platform with a larger active area and a state of the art fiber optic interface, by leveraging existing technology from their portfolio. What is planned for the Phase II project In the Phase II project, two parallel objectives will be executed 1) the remaining design components will be developed and the detector will be fabricated, tested and installed at several light source beamlines for full system evaluation and 2) an updated application specific integrated circuit will be developed to rapidly push the detector technology forward, so as to be ready for the needs of the future upgraded light sources. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits A robust and commercially supported detector with the current proven performance specifications will enable x-ray scattering without the need to introduce structured semitransparent beam stops or phase diffusers, which is not possible with today\u2019s commercial detectors. This will lead to new higher resolution, and sharper contrast diffraction patterns and higher resolution structure determination. These advances will provide the user community with unparalleled resolution of data sets with even larger dynamic ranges, drastically improve scientist\u2019s ability to collect data, and allow greater insight into materials."

        "abstract": "There exists a need to obtain near-real-time information in a wireless tool configuration to be used in dynamic geothermal well conditions, such as when drilling is in progress. A tool which can provide this near real-time information from sensors located near the bit of the drill string will help reduce the hazards and costs associated with geothermal well development by allowing surface monitoring of key variables such as bit vibration (for extending the bit life and penetration rates of PDC and roller bits, and verifying the operation of hammer bits); drill pipe and annular pressure (for quickly detecting and locating lost circulation and high-pressure zones); and downhole temperatures (to better match drilling fluid and cement properties to field conditions). All of these factors play critical roles in enhancing wellbore integrity under high-temperature, high-pressure conditions.How Problem will be addressed:The proposed near-real-time wireless tool will be achieved by modifying a commercial ElectroMagnetic Measurement While Drilling (EM MWD) System to operate in the high temperature environments associated with geothermal well applications. During Phase 1, a system architecture, based on distributed computing techniques, capable of hosting advanced digital coding protocols and adaptive digital modulation techniques will be developed using electronic components that can operate at geothermal temperatures while unprotected by thermal flasks. Specifically, silicon-on-insulator (SOI) and silicon-carbide (SiC) semiconductors will be investigated for the design of the downhole electronics with a goal to operate for extended periods of time at a maximum temperature of 250\u00b0C (which is well above the temperature specification for our current commercial packaging technology). This temperature specification should be sufficient to satisfy drilling requirements for reservoirs up to 300\u00b0C since drilling fluids dramatically cool a well below the surrounding reservoir temperature. A commercial system system that has been successfully used under air-drilling conditions will be implemented, so the new geothermal system will be fully capable of operating in CO2 reservoirs as well."

        "abstract": "The supercritical CO2 (sCO2) Brayton cycle is gaining interest across a variety of power generation applications due to its potential for providing higher efficiencies. The range of industrial applications include: industrial waste and heat recovery, coal and nuclear power plants, and renewable energy sources such as solar thermal and fuel cells. Direct fired sCO2 cycle loops require combustors that operate beyond the critical point of CO2 in a flow regime that is not well understood. Development of efficient combustor designs at these conditions presents many challenges due to the lack of design and simulation tools that properly account for the reaction kinetics, turbulent mixing and real fluid property variations. Our proposed work here addresses these deficiencies. Statement of How this Problem or Situation is Being Addressed: The design of combustors for sCO2 power cycles presents many challenges since the physics of the reaction kinetics, turbulent flame interactions and real fluid properties in this flow regime are not well understood. Under this project an advanced turbulent combustion model was developed to address complex reacting flow environments under real fluid conditions. Accurate kinetic modeling under these conditions was also be addressed in partnership with the Georgia Institute of Technology. Under the Phase I effort the framework of the new modeling approach was developed and demonstrated. This project will extended an advanced modeling formulation for application to real fluids and multi-stream mixing environments. The model was then be demonstrated for a current SCO2 power cycle combustor geometry. Under the Phase II program with new modeling formulation will be rigorously validated with respect experimental data for multiple experimental configurations and cases. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:The sCO2 Brayton cycle is gaining interest across a variety of power generation applications including nuclear, fossil fuel, waste heat as well as solar thermal and fuel cells due to its potential for providing efficiencies up to 5% points higher than a steam Rankine cycle. However, the design of efficient combustors for direct fired systems is complex. Our work here provides a high-fidelity design tool that permits accurate performance predictions in this thermodynamic regime and enables the commercialization of optimal combustor designs for these more efficient power generation systems."

        "abstract": "Rapid, simple and inexpensive molecular on-site diagnostics for the detection of classes of microbes are essential for the bioremediation community. The sophisticated techniques currently used for detection of microbial activity in submerged soils and aquatic sediments can be labor intensive and technically difficult. In addition, the expense of these approaches can discourage the series of measurements over time required for relating microbial activity to seasonal changes or environmental disturbances\u2014thus limiting the value of such tests. This project\u2019s portable nanomaterial-based sensor will quantitatively detect subsurface microbes on site with minimal user training. General statement of how the problem is being addressed: The project team is developing a sensitive nanomaterial-based microbial monitor that will detect biomarkers indicative of key metabolic functions of Geobacter species specific to the Rifle site and Berkeley Lab\u2019s East River, Colorado research watershed. The envisioned sensor would have a disposable sensor chip that could be used with a portable hand-held unit for data acquisition, processing and read-out. What was done in Phase I: In Phase I, the team developed a working model that was validated with chemostat cultures of Geobacter. The sensors detected femtomolar levels of the metabolic proteins specific to Geobacter within 30 minutes. An unambiguous sensor response was seen for the target metabolic protein biomarkers amongst approximately 3000 other proteins with minimal cross- reactivity. What is planned for the Phase II: In Phase II, we will further test, evaluate and refine the sensor prototype to target general guidance on microbial processes in the sites of interest. Advances in Phase II will expand the monitor to include enzymes catalyzing methane production and sulfate reduction. We will also develop reader housing and software to support sensor data acquisition and display. Commercial applications and other benefits: The underlying technology has the capacity to detect a wide array of microbes and microbial functions in situ and in real time. Thus, this sensor device will support the approximately $7B United States remediation market, driven by needs of the Department of Energy, Department of Defense, Resources Conservation and Recovery Act, superfund sites, and others."

        "abstract": "Particle accelerators need precise, real-time control of the particle beams used to create the conditions required for Nuclear Physics (NP) experiments. The digital feedback of these control systems requires low latency ADCs with high linearity and dynamic range. High performance multichannel digitizers dissipate excessive heat. Therefore, low power dissipation is another critical requirement for ADCs. Currently available 12-bit 500MSps ADCs include only 2 channels and require 12 clock cycles per conversion. Pacific Microchip Corp. proposes to develop a 12-bit 32 channel (operating in parallel) 500MSps low latency, low power ADC ASIC. The ADC will employ a novel two-step conversion architecture based on a merged sample &amp; hold (S\/H) circuit, a residue C-DAC and a shared 6-bit flash core ADC. The core ADC will provide coarse and fine digitization, one after another, by using two cycles. The proposed 2- step ADC will feature a flash-like performance using just a fraction of the on-chip area and power consumption compared to a regular flash ADC.Within Phase I, the ADC\u2019s architecture was developed and modeled, the critical circuits were designed and the proof of feasibility at architectural and circuit level was provided based on simulations. Phase II will result in the fabricated and tested ADC ASIC\u2019s prototype ready for commercialization in Phase III. Commercial applications and other benefits: Due to the increasing role of digital signal processing in the state of the art electronic systems, an ADC becomes a generic building block employed to perform direct digitization and multichannel signal processing for a great number of applications including sensor systems, control loops and RF receivers. Thus, the multichannel low power, high sampling rate 12-bit ADC will be demanded for a large number of tasks. Radiation hardness will expand the proposed ADC ASIC\u2019s applicability to other DOE and NASA science programs and to the systems under development by the industry. To ensure the highest outcome of the developed technology, we plan to license the ASIC as an IP block to other interested parties for integration with other blocks (both analog and digital) for a system-on-a-chip (SoC) solution. According to the latest market study released by Technavio, the global data converter market is expected to reach $4.24 billion by 2020, growing at a CAGR of almost 6%. This projection confirms the great commercial potential for the proposed ADC."

        "abstract": "The Department of Energy\u2019s Office of Nuclear Physics Isotope Development and Production for Research and Applications Program has identified a need for materials that will survive high radiation environments to support next generation rare isotope beam facilities. Specifically, long-lifetime, rotary vacuum and water seals are needed to survive 0.5 \u2013 15 MGy\/month. Current gaskets and seals do not offer the combined mechanical and radiation survivability needed for years of service, and can evolve HF which is a major safety hazard. How this problem is being addressed: The objective of Phase I and II of this program is to develop and demonstrate advanced rotary vacuum and water seals with extreme radiation durability. The approach involves the synthesis of innovative non-fluorinated polymers that do not evolve HF and offer combined low air and water permeability with extreme radiation durability. What was done in Phase I: In Phase I, advanced polymers were developed and exposed to harsh irradiation alongside candidate commercial seal materials for a durability study to reach a Technology Readiness Level 5. Mechanical, thermal, and thermomechanical testing were conducted prior to and post irradiation. What is planned for Phase II: 2-3 A down-selected set of polymers shall be irradiated under harsh radiation up to 600 kGy, and then under conditions representative of the rare isotope beam facility at Brookhaven&apos;s Linac Isotope Producer, up to 20 MGy. Seal prototypes shall be extruded, and seal performance shall be evaluated. Technology Readiness Level 7 shall be reached via experiments in a representative rare isotope high radiation environment. Commercial applications and other benefits: Radiation durable rotary vacuum and water seals shall be manufactured for use with rare isotope beam facilities for the stable production of new and rare isotopes. These isotopes shall benefit advanced imaging needs within the medical community. Many dual-use applications are being explored with partners in space, military, and nuclear energy markets."

        "abstract": "The proposed program provides a new biomass conversion technology to produce FDCA, 2,5- furandicarboxylic acid, to replace hydrocarbon chemicals for production of plasticizers and polyester polymers. FDCA is currently produced from hexose carbohydrates, such as sucrose or high fructose corn syrup. Recent trends in petroleum pricing have reduced biomass raw material cost advantages for replacement of hydrocarbon chemicals, a key driving force for sustainable FDCA commercialization. The proposed technology will provide an alternative pathway to FDCA using low cost biomass obtained from a wet waste pulp mill hydrolysate stream. The new technology will use a slip stream of hydrolysate from a hardwood pulp mill currently being disposed of as a wet organic waste through a waste heat boiler. The production of high value chemicals, such as FDCA, from waste pulp hydrolysate will provide new technologies and products from pulp and paper manufacture to enhance industry profitability, employment and competiveness. The Phase I program successfully demonstrated the technical and economic feasibility of the new catalytic reactive distillation technology for FDCA from pulp waste hydrolysate. The Phase I program successfully demonstrated the production of FDCA by the CO2 carboxylation of furoic acid at greater than 90% selectivity, and a commercially scalable reaction system for performing the carboxylation reaction. The Phase I program also established the feasibility of producing the furoic acid intermediate from furfural derived from pulp mill waste hydrolysate. The new technology, based on a waste stream currently burned for fuel value, will provide a low cost manufacturing process to accelerate the commercialization of FDCA. In the Phase II program, research and development will be completed to support immediate commercialization of the new technology for FDCA production. The overall manufacturing process will be optimized to provide low cost, high quality FDCA product. Performance of FDCA-based non- phthalate plasticizers will be confirmed to meet commercial requirements. The program includes a subcontract to the Department of Chemical Engineering at the University of Massachusetts. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:FDCA produced by the new technology will find immediate application for production of non- phthalate bio-plasticizers for PVC, and for the production of large volume polyester polymers for fibers, beverage bottles, and other products. The proposed technology will provide a new low cost raw material base for FDCA production, as well as utilizing carbon dioxide greenhouse gas for commodity chemical manufacture. The new technology will benefit the U.S. pulp and paper industry by providing new products from pulp and paper manufacture, to enhance industry profitability, and employment."

        "abstract": "The rise of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from a range of power plants and industrial sources have contributed to alarmingly-increased atmospheric levels of CO2. Several capture and sequestration (CCS) technologies are under investigation to reduce CO2 emissions from new and existing coal- and gas-fired power plants and large industrial sources. Although there are a number of active and effective CCS programs, there remains a strong need for alternative routes to recycle the CO2 into useful products rather than just sequestering the CO2 for long-term storage. This will provide new valuable products and drive a market for the CO2 to offset the capture costs. The direct use of the CO2 as a chemical feedstock represents a logical strategy. However, due to the high thermodynamic stability of CO2, conventional chemical synthesis routes require high activation temperatures and pressures to drive the reaction, thus limiting the economic viability of the direct use of CO2.Statement of how this problem or situation is being addressed Electrochemical activation provides an alternative low temperature and pressure route with much lower energy pathway, thus facilitating direct reuse of CO2. Furthermore, the potential synthesis of carboxylic acids by the direct insertion of the electrochemically activated CO2 radical represents a cost-effective pathway to an interesting and attractive class of chemicals. Carboxylic acids are used as key intermediates in a wide range of pharmaceuticals, polymers, agrochemicals, and fragrances, with a large number of both high-volume and niche high-value products possible. In Phase I, Mainstream demonstrated the stable production of a range of carboxylic acid intermediates with high yields and current efficiencies using Mainstream\u2019s high-performance gas diffusion based electrode structures and electrochemical flow cell design. The direct electrochemical insertion of CO2 not only provides a pathway to utilizing abundant CO2 but offers an alternative more straightforward and more environmentally acceptable route to many carboxylic acids. In Phase II, we will further optimize the gas diffusion electrode, electrochemical cells design and overall reaction chemistry to maximize the yield, reaction rate and overall energy efficiency for the capture and reuse of CO2.Commercial Applications and Other BenefitsMainstream\u2019s electrochemical synthesis can be applied to utilize CO2 directly in a wide range of chemical syntheses of valuable organic intermediates. Our approach provides a low energy pathway to the utilization of the abundant supply of captured CO2 provide a market for the CO2 as well as providing an economically and environmentally viable approach to the production of in-demand chemical intermediates."

        "abstract": "In this Phase II SBIR program, QuesTek Innovations LLC, a leader in the field of integrated computational materials engineering (ICME), proposes to develop a methodology and software suite for applying Bayesian statistics to fit CALculation of PHAse Diagrams (CALPHAD)-based thermodynamic databases to quantify, store, and propagate the uncertainty in the chemical thermodynamic models. QuesTek will build off of the success of the Phase I program at demonstrating that such a methodology can be used to quantify and propagate uncertainty through thermodynamic calculations to apply Bayesian CALPHAD to databases of quaternary and higher order materials systems. As a partner of the Center for Hierarchical Materials Design (CHiMaD), QuesTek will connect this software suite with web-aware tools for sharing materials data developed in CHiMaD such as the Materials Data Curation System (MDCS). QuesTek will work with Thermo-Calc Inc., world-leader in CALPHAD thermodynamic software, to ensure the developed methodology will be robust and well-suited for commercial CALPHAD software. In Phase I of this program, QuesTek has applied its expertise in ICME and CALPHAD to develop web-based tools for performing chemical thermodynamics calculations and for working with CALPHAD databases. QuesTek has worked with Citrine Informatics to develop CALPHAD database and experimental data file search functionality for Citrine\u2019s web-based platform. QuesTek developed a python-based web application for performing CALPHAD thermodynamic calculations using the Thermo-Calc software platform. QuesTek has also developed a Bayesian framework for incorporating uncertainty quantification into CALPHAD model databases and propagating this uncertainty through chemical thermodynamic calculations to provide confidence intervals on predicted thermo- chemical quantities. QuesTek has demonstrated this framework on a thermoelectric alloy system PbS\u2014PbTe that has potential applications for waste-heat recovery and power generation. In Phase II of this program, QuesTek will build out this uncertainty quantification\/propagation framework to apply to large CALPHAD thermodynamic databases containing up to hundreds or thousands of model parameters. These types of databases are used in practice to design and develop new materials. A key component of incorporating uncertainty quantification into CALPHAD thermodynamics is a tight coupling between the underlying thermodynamic models, the numerical minimizer used to calculate equilibrium, and the Monte Carlo simulations used to sample model parameter space. To this end, QuesTek will develop the methodology of Bayesian-based CALPHAD thermodynamics will be developed on pycalphad, open-source python-based thermodynamics calculation software that can be tightly integrated with pymc3, open-source python-based Bayesian modeling software. Another key component of incorporating uncertainty quantification into CALPHAD thermodynamics is the storage and dissemination of the uncertainty associated with a fitted thermodynamic model. QuesTek will leverage its partnership with the Center for Hierarchical Materials Design (CHiMaD), a NIST Center of Excellence, to disseminate the uncertainty-quantified data generated in this program. CHiMaD has several web-based materials tools that enable sharing of materials data including the Materials Data Curation System (MDCS) and Materials Data Facility (MDF). QuesTek will develop schema for the Bayesian CALPHAD databases developed in this program that will allow this type of data structure to be shared through these web-aware materials platforms."

        "abstract": "Software protection and its associated tools can be regarded as a first line of defense for run-time integrity in an High Performance Computing (HPC) system, but cannot be easily extended to provide security solution beyond the software level. Hence, it is also essential to build a system-wide security analysis tool to assess the entire HPC system\u2019s security. The major challenges for building such a tool include efficient data processing under limited resource and performance constraint, customized feature extraction for security assessment, and the balance between security and overhead\/usability. Statement of How this Problem or Situation is Being Addressed: To address this need, a machine learning based security assessment tool is being developed to ensure system-wide security monitoring and assessment in HPC systems. The overall approach is to leverage existing\/future HPC profiling and tracing tools to provide real-time data collection and then use this information combined with HPC program behavioral knowledge, system logs and network traffic data for cyber security assessment using big data analytics and machine learning techniques. What was done in Phase I: During the Phase I period, to meet the project objectives, the following has been performed: literature study, system architecture design, machine learning algorithms design and development, preliminary system implementation, and initial performance evaluation of our proposed solution. The final goal is to provide a software tool that can efficiently collect system-wide data (user, application, and network) in HPC systems, perform analysis to detect security related events and generate effective alerts. What is planned for the Phase II project: In Phase II, this security assessment tool will be further developed to provide better data analytics for system-wide security monitoring and assessment. Its core functionalities include data collection and pre-processing, classification of HPC applications and phases, network anomaly detection and security assessment, and synthetic data generation of normal and abnormal datasets. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: The proposed security tool has a significant impact on the cyber security enhancement for HPC systems to improve HPC security at the entire system level and raise global operational security awareness for system administrators. It can be applied to and benefit a broad range of HPC centers and Large-Scale Distributed Computer Systems in industry (such as IT, various science applications, finance\/economics, etc.), university\/academic, and government agencies (such as defense and government labs)."

        "abstract": "PCI\u2019s innovation is a compact, modular Post Combustion Carbon Capture System (PCCCS) utilizing high internal volume nanosorbents for carbon capture, supported on a tailorable substrate. Our system enables low pressure drop, high volumetric utilization and high mass transfer, and is suitable for the rapid heat transfer and low temperature swing regeneration operating modes needed for cost-effective carbon capture. Capital and operating costs are reduced based on lowered energy demand. Our approach to regenerable CO2 capture eliminates close to 90% of the energy cost required for operation of methylethanolamine (MEA) based systems. In Phase I this approach has been proof-of concept demonstrated at the laboratory level. Our work also included an economic model for integration with a coal-fired power plant that demonstrated our approach can meet the DOE cost-goals related to effective carbon-capture. Our primary benefit will be a new technology for substantially reducing the cost of CO2 capture, offering energy savings and economic advantage to industries that may need to reduce carbon emissions. Worldwide, carbon emissions are forecasted to grow dramatically, with fossil fuel combustion and industry accounting for substantial CO2 emissions and with competing industries and economies worldwide seeking to reduce carbon emissions. Carbon capture technologies provide a path to reduce net carbon emissions while also supplying CO2 for integration with value-added chains of several industries, including enhanced oil recovery and an emerging industry of converting CO2 to value added chemicals such as fuels and plastics. Technologies that capture CO2 emissions at lower cost offer potential for American global economic advantage and energy independence, both for domestic industries that save energy using the technology and as the basis for export products that deliver the technology to others. Phase II work will build on the Phase I success to further develop and optimize our sorbent and substrate properties, demonstrate performance and durability testing with coal-derived flue gas, and produce a refined techno-economic analysis model based on CFD and process modeling and a fully integrated economic analysis including balance of plant components. Our product\u2019s essential value proposition is that it enables lower cost post-combustion carbon capture, with potential for further cost reductions with further technology development, experience and scale. The critical need it will fulfill is to provide carbon capture at lower cost than other technologies, offering energy savings and economic advantage to industries and plants that need to actually remove carbon emissions from their post-combustion exhaust."

        "abstract": "Computation plays an important role in materials science, engineering, nanotechnology, pharmaceutical research and many other research fields. Faster time to market, increased return on investment, and enabling new products are common reasons computation is used in product development. However, surveys have shown that moderate sized companies are only slowly adopting materials simulations and taking advantage of the potential increases in innovation and productivity. Statement of how this problem is being addressed Improving the adoption of computational chemistry software is addressed by developing a frame- work to help streamline complex simulation workflows (STREAMM) involving molecular dynamics and quantum chemistry simulations. This framework will be provided in a user-friendly application capable of taking advantage of cloud computing resources, such as Amazon\u2019s Web Services (AWS) or Microsoft\u2019s Azure platform, for the pharmaceutical and materials industries. What was done in Phase I Phase I developed and tested Docker containers enabling molecular dynamics simulations (LAMMPS) and density functional theory calculations (NWChem) to be run on AWS clusters. Excellent parallel scaling efficiency was demonstrated for both codes on multi-node clusters. Containers were also developed for the STREAMM framework and another quantum chemistry code (QMCPack). Initial products are planned for sale in the UberCloud marketplace in the near term. What is planned for Phase II Phase II work will include additional simulation codes to be containerized and made available through the UberCloud marketplace (available for both AWS and Microsoft Azure), such as SP- PARKS (kinetic Monte Carlo) and AWSEM-MD (appropriate for ligand binding in drug discovery) that are more appropriate for our targeted markets. Also, specific industry workflows, defined by our identified beta testers who have provided support letters, will be implemented in a new application ChemiStream. Lastly, open-source machine learning and artificial intelligence methods will be provided to leverage recent successes in drug discovery.Commercial applications and other benefits We are seeking to improve the drug discovery process in the pharmaceutical industry, and the product development cycle in materials processing companies. By making cutting-edge, open- source software from the national labs easier to use, their entire user communities, including those in academia and at the national labs, will benefit as well."

        "abstract": "For nuclear physics research, thin film isotopic specialty targets are often requested for the use and in charged-particle-induced experiments. There are also tens of radioisotopes that are of interest for medical imaging, industrial and R&amp;D uses. The targets of interest include B, O, Si, and Cr; isotopes of refractory metals, such as Re, Os, Ir are good examples. However, many of the isotopes cannot be made as free-standing foils and require thin film backing. The limitations of existing backing materials are poor thermal and mechanical stability. Statement of How this Problem or Situation is Being Addressed \u2013 All-carbon graphene-based films would be an excellent choice as a backing material due to its high thermal conductivity, high temperature tolerance, low outgassing, mechanical integrity and ease of handling. In addition, it would be possible to electroplate a thin layer of the target material or its precursor over the conducting graphene surface in case of limited availability of the isotope, or if the isotopic material cannot be deposited by sputtering or e-beam or thermal evaporation. For specialty targets, the target material can also be embedded in the graphene matrix during the backing film fabrication. What was done in Phase I - In Phase I, we fabricated thin graphene backing films with B-11, Cr, and Ir targets by different techniques: sputtering deposition, electroplating, and target material embedded in graphene matrix. The fabricated graphene backed targets along with free standing graphene films were delivered to ANL for evaluation. What is planned for Phase II - In Phase II, we will optimize the processes and techniques developed in Phase I, introduce a new target preparation method, fabricate an enriched isotopic Cr-52 target, as well as refractory metal targets (W, Mo, Nb) by different techniques. The fabricated targets will be delivered to ANL for evaluation. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits \u2013 The technology that will be developed in this effort may have additional commercial applications in the area of extraction foils for medical cyclotrons, filter membranes, transparent optical conductors, X-Ray and ion beam windows, and polymer nanocomposites for automotive, aerospace and defense applications."

        "abstract": "Development of high performance downhole components and materials is necessary to enable geothermal exploration and production capabilities in high pressure and high temperature applications. Conventional well materials are poorly suited for corrosive environments. Steel casing, screens, and other wellbore components are susceptible to corrosion in extreme geothermal conditions. An ideal replacement for many of these components is a ceramic-like material formed in place, with porosity and permeability tailored to the application\u2019s requirements. Such a form can be achieved through Self-propagating High-temperature Synthesis (SHS), an engineered fuel\/oxidizer reaction complemented with additives to yield specific product properties. These reactions can produce strong, dense, corrosion-resistant, predominantly ceramic matrices with very high inherent service temperatures (greater than 1000\u00b0C). The objective of this proposed effort is to explore the viability of forming high porosity ceramic features in-place for applications such as well screens or borehole stabilization features. The initial Phase I effort evaluated the application environment and developed performance specifications for the ceramic screen application. Thermite\/diluent systems were developed and tested to achieve a range of permeability, porosity, mechanical strength, corrosion resistance, and reaction properties. Pressurized experiments evaluated the ability to sustain the reaction to completion and retain porosity in the products at pressures typical of deep emplacements. Based on the material development and scaled test results, a conceptual design was developed for three specific applications: screen and sand control, bridge plug or drillable packer, and borehole stabilization\/lost circulation remedy. The proposed Phase II activities will refine the reactive material formulations, improve their porosity generating capacity under pressure, develop reaction simulation tools to assist design, and demonstrate the applications in field tests at shallow well sites and in geothermal wells."

        "abstract": "High Performance Computing technology has advanced significantly. Advanced parallel computers are being built, with DOE leadership. Yet, the American engineering\/manufacturing industry has not leveraged parallel computing at a significant level, partly because of the challenging nature of modern simulation software. US competitiveness in manufacturing may suffer due to its ineffective utilization of parallel computers. Objective: The broad objective of this project is to make Adaptive MPI (AMPI) become a plug-and-play replacement for other MPI implementations, but with added adaptive automatic capabilities such as load balancing, fault tolerance, and checkpoint\/restart. This easy to state objective leads to a complex set of research\/implementation challenges, but will ensure widespread adoption. Phase I Work: Included increased MPI standard compliance, performance improvements to match or exceed industry-standard implementations, exploration, enumeration and amelioration of ease-of-use concerns, and industry discussions and collaborations to identify challenges and opportunities. Phase II Plans: Includes a) improving value proposition by enhancing adaptivity features, flexible runtime-optimized integration of within-node parallelism, adaptively optimized support for cloud environments, etc., b) lowering barrier to entry, e.g by automating global-variable privatization for thread safety, standard compliance, Python support, etc., c) providing infrastructure enhancements, and d) application demonstrations with external partners, and in-house development of libraries and mini-applications. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: The SBIR project effort is aimed at producing a commercially viable product based on Adaptive MPI that incorporates innovative research on dynamic run-time systems with the familiar programming interface of MPI. It will be the main commercial application to result directly from this effort. In addition, it is expected that libraries developed using the Adaptive MPI product will be an additional category of commercial applications. Some of these may come from Charmworks, Inc., but it is expected that many, in the future, will come from other companies. End-user applications is probably the largest category of commercial applications enabled by this project effort. This project aims to achieve a broad impact on the state of HPC adoption among the manufacturing and engineering industries."

        "abstract": "Advanced new and upgraded synchrotron X-ray beamlines and sources are being constructed worldwide, and these facilities require fast new X-ray detectors to complement them and foster new scientific applications. In particular, new detector capabilities are desirable in the time domain, for the study of fast material and molecular kinetics, in the intensity domain for keeping up with brighter X-ray sources, and in the energy discrimination domain for combining area detection with new energy resolution techniques. This grant will be used to develop and commercialize a fast new hybrid pixel array detector for use in materials science experiments at these facilities. The new detector\u2019s novel properties are the abilities to record two simultaneous X-ray images at different colors or sample times, and the ability to accurately measure much more intense X-rays than previously possible. This detector will be used for many new classes of experiments, such as pump-probe X-ray scattering, X-ray fluorescence, and time-resolved X-ray spectroscopy.In Phase I, a small-sized prototype X-ray detector was built around a 48x48 pixel chip, and software and firmware was developed to operate it and see the dual images it produces. The prototype detector\u2019s functionality and novel features were demonstrated in X-ray tests, showing that its new dual gate functions can be used to sync the counters to multiple time points in experiments. In Phase II, a significantly larger-sized X-ray detector, with 768x704 pixels, will be designed and built in three stages (full-sized chip, then a multi-chip module, then a tiled multi-module detector). Each stage will be bench tested and characterized with X-rays, and at several points outside scientists will be invited to perform synchrotron experiments in real-world pump-probe experiments. Polished and user-friendly software will be designed and used to operate the detector in many experimental environments.The development of this X-ray detector into a mature, stable, commercial instrument promises to open the doors to new scientific and technological breakthroughs in many fields. These include those studying fast processes in materials, such as nanoscale devices, solar energy conversion and energy storage materials."

        "abstract": "The design and fabrication of vacuum nano-electronic devices is essential to the present and future US economy and energy sources. Highly-resolved 3D electrostatic particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations are required to correctly model and optimize their fabrication and operation; however, the associated run-time and complexity of such HPC codes is prohibitive. The Scientific Discovery through Advanced Computing (SciDAC) program has contributed to the development of Warp, an open source multi-species 3D PIC code that scales efficiently to many cores and includes many state-of-the-art algorithms, including mesh refinement. With code hardening, and some additional physics and design capabilities, Warp will profoundly impact the vacuum nano- electronics industry.We are developing a commercial quality GUI for cloud-based execution of Warp on HPC servers, with CAD integration for complex geometries, and with specialized capabilities to design and optimize vacuum nano-electronic devices, emphasizing thermionic converters for electricity generation. We are demonstrating the capabilities of this interface by optimizing the design of thermionic converters for industrial application.RadiaSoft has developed a browsed-based GUI for cloud-based execution of Warp for 2D electrostatic devices. We have improved the dielectric and quasi-static solvers to permit faster and more accurate simulations of devices using dielectric support structures. We demonstrated integration of STL file formats with Warp for 3D rectilinear objects. Finally, we performed nonlinear optimization of 3D rectilinear thermionic converter designs using both gradient-based and evolutionary algorithms.We will extend our interface to support the design, simulation, and optimization of realistic 3D devices. To do this, we will extend our GUI to support 3D design and visualization, the submission of jobs at supercomputers, as well as the use of nonlinear optimization toolkits. We will enhance Warp&apos;s underlying grid geometries to support non-conformal device geometries. Finally, we will further explore non-steady state physics, including ionization, external-biasing, and lifetime effects. With these new tools, we will demonstrate the optimization of realistic devices, including a diverse array of energy loss channels. The RadiaSoft commercialization strategy is to provide highly-skilled scientific and engineering R&amp;D consulting and subscription-based HPC support services across a broad range of submarkets including nanoelectronics."

        "abstract": "Today 80% of the produced oil and gas from unconventional oil and gas reservoirs is from 20% of the hydro fracturing operations. Although geophone based micro-seismic monitoring has improved the hydraulic fracturing process, conventional micro-seismic monitoring alone is not sufficient to optimize the process. To improve the hydraulic fracturing process new instruments must be developed to record new types and larger volumes of better quality seismic data. Cost-effective solutions are also required so that society may understand the entire fracturing and water disposal process through wide spread use of cost-effective sensors that will provide improved characterization and monitoring. Electronic solutions usually record only low frequencies and only detect larger signals and have thermal limits, leading to limited applications. Electronic geophones are not capable of measuring and mapping most of the low magnitude, high frequency signals that are being produced by the fracturing process. Furthermore, the arrays deployed today are too short, which limits the positioning accuracy of the mapped events. Longer aperture antennas are required to accurately map micro seismic events.Borehole seismology can map geologic formations in outstanding detail; it has also been shown that borehole seismology can effectively monitor fluid and gas injection processes. A single channel interferometric fiber optic seismic sensor was developed in Phase I that is capable of being multiplexed into systems containing hundreds of sensors generating a large aperture antenna. This will be created by writing reflectors into a fiber whereby the fiber between reflectors becomes the sensor. This type of Distributed Optical Seismic Sensor (DOSS) combines the positive attributes of Distributed Acoustic Sensor (DAS) having a large aperture with the positive attribute of interferometric interrogation which is orders of magnitude more sensitive than DAS. The fiber will be placed inside a \u00bc\u201d Inconel tubing to finalize the sensor manufacturing. An optical seismic interrogator will be designed and manufactured that can multiplex enough sensors to monitor a 5,000 ft long fracturing process. The sensor will be exposed to simulated environments in a laboratory while recording data to validate and optimize the design. Applications According to the Department of Energy, at least 2 million wells in the US have been hydraulically fractured. There is also a large backlog of wells awaiting fracturing since the price of oil significantly dropped midway through 2014. The proposed large aperture system will cost effectively monitor and map these operations. The low sensor cost and the sensitivity will make them attractive for deployment in fracturing operations. Once cost-effective solutions are available for monitoring hydraulic fracturing it is likely to be legislated that monitoring must be performed."

        "abstract": "A critical demand in today\u2019s world is the need for efficiently managing, operating, and securing the network infrastructure and environment. It is very important to allow scientists to operate uninterrupted on high-speed networks and enable them to make scientific discoveries. It is critical to discover and avert constantly increasing cybersecurity attacks and cyber terrorism that are serious threats to global socio-economic prosperity and safety. Existing network analysis and cybersecurity tools lack the capability to consistently provide deep operational network visibility and discover sophisticated cyber attacks. Project Objective The overall objective of the project is to develop a usable and scalable network analysis tool that can analyze huge volumes of network data and provide actionable insights into the network. The purpose of developing such a tool is to address the challenging and critical problems that the Government and commercial organizations are facing in managing and securing their network and provide them with an advanced analytic tool to secure and operate networks effectively. The overall technical approach is based on advanced \u201ctensor analysis,\u201d that enables the user to deeply analyze network data to get actionable insights and discover sophisticated attacks. What was done in Phase I? We successfully developed a prototype network analysis tool and put the tool into use in two different operational network environments. We demonstrated the capability of the tool to provide actionable insights through the extraction of multimodal network patterns and discover cyber attacks even when they are obfuscated. We published and presented the key proof-of-concept capabilities and results from the project in peer-reviewed conferences\/workshops. We disseminated the results to interested entities in Government and commercial sectors. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits CANDID will significantly improve the reliability and operation of commercial, research, and Government (DOE, DOD, and other agencies) networks, and will reduce the overall operational costs and risks for network management. By providing visibility into threats and attacks on networks (for example, detecting anomalous behavior such as unauthorized data movement) CANDID will be a critical tool for the defense intelligence community. CANDID will bring tangible benefits to commercial sectors such as the health and finance sectors, by offering improved visibility, reliability, and protection to the networks that are critical for their operations and business."

        "abstract": "Environmental sensor networks capable of taking data quickly enough to capture minute-scale fluctuations and durable enough to capture these data for entire seasons provide essential information for studying the seasonal and annual effects of environmental activity across complete ecosystems. The models informed by this data are useful for predicting both short- and long-term changes to economically important coastal ecosystems. Distributed sensors for dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration measurement in coastal marine settings are of particular interest because of the important role DO plays in catalyzing a diversity of environmentally important biogeochemical reactions. However, commercially available DO sensors are not suited for long-term or in situ measurements in marine environments. How this Problem or Situation is Being Addressed: We are developing dissolved oxygen sensors that are suitable for long-term and in-situ measurements in terrestrial, aquatic, and marine environments. What was done in Phase I: In Phase I of this work we have developed and successfully deployed the beginnings of a distributed dissolved oxygen sensing network. The deployments have included dockside locations and installation into deployable benthic flux chambers. We have also developed and used a submersible data logger. What is planned for the Phase II project: In Phase II of this project we will continue the development of our probes and scale up our production methods, with the goal of market entry within two years. We will instrument an entire iverine\/estuarine\/marine ecosystem and expand our deployment capabilities to deep marine applications. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: Dissolved oxygen measurements provide critical information for many areas, including water-quality assessment, groundwater contamination modeling, industrial-process control, and the management of fisheries. Improvements in sensing technology that improve performance and reduce cost will benefit these areas directly. These technological developments will also enable the deployment of marine ecosystem-scale sensing networks that will provide information critical to the improvement of predictive ecosystem models. These ecosystem models guide our efforts to protect economically important coastal marine ecosystems."

        "abstract": "Electron-ion colliders (EICs) are the best microscopes for studying the structure of nuclear matter, particularly the nature and origin of spin in nuclei. To be effective, such machines require electron and ion beams with polarizations as high as 80%. Comprehensive end-to-end simulations to study the spin dynamics and optimize the beam polarization require exorbitant computational effort. Technical Approach: We will improve the capabilities for modeling spin polarized beams by taking advantage of modern computational architectures and improved algorithms for spin tracking. Our easy-to-use interface will allow scientists to quickly launch large-scale simulations on remote HPC clusters. Phase I Results: In Phase I we developed code profiling tools and used these to identify computation bottlenecks in the spin tracking code, Zgoubi. With this information significant improvements were made to some of the most computationally intensive algorithms, yielding significant improvements. Finally, a new method for symplectic tracking through magnetic field maps was developed. Phase II Plans: We will update and extend the capabilities of the tracking code Zgoubi. Along with parallelization of the code and enhancement of tracking methods we will implement single-click initiation of Zgoubi simulation on remote clusters. This enhanced version of Zgoubi will be used to assist in optimization and validation of designs for the EIC. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: High powered computing is a critical tool in science and technology innovation. As part of this project we will develop capabilities for \u2018single-click\u2019 computing that will enable users to launch sophisticated simulations onto remote HPC machines through a simple graphic interface. Development of this technology will have significant application across my areas of scientific computing."

        "abstract": "Thermal desorption using spouted bed reactor has demonstrated a reduction of 65% of Mercury and 28% of Sulfur content in bituminous coal in laboratory scale setting. Further development is needed to: (1) demonstrate efficient contaminant removal from coal in scaled up system, (2) address relevant needs from industrial partners, and (3) mature the developed coal cleaning technology to commercialization.Statement of how this problem is being addressed: Advanced Cooling Technologies, Inc. (ACT) unique spouted bed reactor is the key innovation that increased performance of thermal desorption of mercury and other contaminants from coal. ACT have reached out to several coal producers and coal-fired power plants and attracted their interests in the developed coal cleaning technology. They will support ACT in the development of plant scale system and implementation to coal-fire energy generating units.What was done in Phase I? In Phase I, ACT designed and fabricated a unique spouted bed reactor to improve particle mixing and heat transfer within the coal bed. The thermal desorption process using ACT\u2019s spouted bed design demonstrated a reduction of 65% of Mercury and 28% of Sulfur content in bituminous coal, which doubled the removal efficiency compared to standard conical spouted bed.What is planned for the Phase II project? ACT, in collaboration with Lehigh University and industrial partners, will improve its spouted bed reactor design to achieve more than 90% reduction in Mercury content from different types of coal (sub-bituminous, anthracite, lignite, etc.). Subsequently, ACT will fabricate a pilot scale reactor designed to remove contaminant from coal via automated\/continuous process. In addition, ACT will also investigate the recovery of Rare Earth Elements and high value metals from coal using our spouted bed reactor. Lastly, ACT will design a plant scale system and perform detailed techno- economic analysis to demonstrate cost and profitability of the developed coal cleaning technology for coal producers and coal-fired power plants.Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: This pre-combustion coal cleaning method provides opportunities for coal-fired power plants to utilize higher Mercury content coal and reduce the cost of current post-combustion Mercury capture systems. ACT\u2019s unique reactor design also improves performance of other applications that utilize spouted bed, including: pharmaceutical, food processing, material drying, particle coating, etc."

        "abstract": "The predictive skill of reactive transport models of hydrobiogeochemical processes currently being used to simulate the coupled interactions of complex subsurface systems (soils, rhizosphere, sediments, aquifers, the vadose zone and groundwaters) is limited by the accuracy of the model parameters that represent subsurface system structure and intrinsic properties. Robust field testing to validate these increasingly-complex models requires accurate, highly-selective, sensitive, and rugged in situ devices for low-cost field deployment in remote locations in order to enhance our ability to monitor processes at finer levels of resolution and over broader areas. The key elements to be measured include carbon, nitrogen, sulfur and phosphorus. Isotopes such as 2H, 18O and molecular species including CH4, CO2, and nitrogen compounds such as N2O are also important markers of relevance to hydrologic and biogeochemical systems.Statement of How this Problem or Situation is Being Addressed This program is aimed at developing a new light source for in situ, fieldable technology improving gas detection sensitivity while also reducing system cost and complexity. The key innovation of this program is use of a resonant-cavity (RC) infrared (IR) light-emitting diode (LED) to replace costly, complicated quantum cascade lasers (QCL) typically used in these applications. Development of this technology will provide a manufacturable solution for monitoring N2O and other gases with similar IR absorption characteristics. The resulting gas monitoring sensor will be small and low cost so that multiple sensors can be placed throughout the terrain to be monitored. The individual gas sensors will be based on a novel RC-LED IR source coupled directly with a proven IR detector, where both LED and detector can be tuned by design to source and detect specific wavelengths. The information collected from the sensor network can then be sent to a base station for concentration analysis, data recording and additional processing. What is being done in Phase II In the Phase II program Amethyst Research will develop a resonant cavity infrared LED optimized to source wavelengths in and around 4.4715 \uf06dm to detect the 14N14N16O isotope of N2O. The Phase II program will also pair the source with an IR detector centered at the same wavelength and will develop a breadboard test system for the entire RC-LED-based N2O sensing system. Commercial Application and Other Benefits: Amethyst is developing a high-sensitivity, paired infrared resonant cavity source and detector for use in monitoring subsurface gaseous species. This technology can be translated to other applications including monitoring of greenhouse gases, IR imaging and IR tomography."

        "abstract": "As computational density for high-performance computing and big-data services continues to scale, performance scalability of next generation computing systems is becoming increasingly constrained by limitations in memory access, power dissipation and chip packaging. The processor-memory communication bottleneck, a major challenge in current multicore processors due to limited pin-out and power budget, presents a detrimental scaling barrier to data-intensive computing. General statement of how this problem is being addressed: A consortium team of small businesses and leading researchers that includes experts from photonics processor-memory architecture, III\/V photonic laser design\/fabrication, silicon photonics design\/fabrication, photonics packaging and assembly, and FPGA-based high performance memory controller IP development \u2013 to collaboratively develop a commercialization path for a Photonic Memory Controller Module (P-MCM). What was done in Phase I: Columbia University coordinated the working group and subgroups to provide the system architecture and specifications for each small business consortium team members. Columbia developed high performance memory controller IPs and interfaces in FPGAs platform. Freedom Photonics developed the programmable, tunable laser using mature InP\/GaAs processing. Analog Photonics developed the photonic transceiver and interconnect fabrics using silicon photonic processing. PLC Connections packaged the photonic transceiver and interconnect fabric chips and tunable laser chips and provide a low-loss and robust optical coupling mechanism. What is planned for the Phase II project: Columbia University will continue to coordinate the working group and subgroups to provide the system architecture and specifications for each small business consortium team members. Columbia will update high performance memory controller IPs and interfaces in FPGAs platform to meet Phase II goals and perform a final end-of-Phase II P-MCM demonstration. Freedom Photonics will develop and package a 17-channel integrated source laser array. Analog Photonics will design, fabricate and package switch, photonic transceiver, driver IC and interconnect fabrics using silicon photonic processing. PLC Connections will develop high density, low cost I\/O packaging technology to interconnect the ICs and components developed in this program using dense fiber arrays to provide a low-loss and robust optical coupling mechanism, and deliver packaged prototypes to Columbia for system integration and demonstration.

The polarized 3He gas has also been used in medical imaging to detect the lung disease. The polarization of 3He strongly relies on the power, linewidth, wavelength stability, and polarization of the pumping laser. Raytum Photonics will develop state of art fiber coupled diode laser system to provide the best and turn-key solution for the production of polarized 3He gas. This system will not only facilitate the polarization of 3He gas, but also improve the polarization efficiency, percentage, and the cost. It will help to achieve the objectives specified in the topic 26e to develop polarized high density 3He gas. During the Phase I effort, we demonstrated on the breadboard a fiber coupled diode laser with output of 180W and wavelength tuning range of more than 0.8nm using a unique modular design. We also demonstrated a diode laser with extremely narrow linewidth of less than 0.06nm and output of more than 50W. The lasing wavelength can be thermally tuned in the range of 0.4 nm, which pave the way for the automatic wavelength locking to the Rb absorption line. The optical modeling work during the Phase I effort also shows the feasibility of making a more than 200W laser module. In the Phase II, we will deliver a fiber coupled diode laser system with output power of more than 200W, linewidth less than 0.1 nm and the lasing wavelength automatically locked to the Rb absorption line. We are also going to engineer a prototype high power laser module to evaluate the concept of kW fiber coupled system for the polarization of 3He. The high power fiber coupled diode laser has also been widely used in the material process industry."

To detect related events, time synchronization of the detector readout electronics is essential. In most existing large digital data acquisition systems, time synchronization is accomplished by sharing clock, trigger, and reset signals within and between chassis. This works well over short distances, but requires dedicated cabling and\/or modules and becomes cumbersome for widely separated arrays. Statement of how it is being addressed: Recently, techniques and standards have been developed to synchronize time in network devices, for example the \u201cPrecision Time Protocol\u201d (IEEE 1588) and the higher performance \u201cWhite Rabbit\u201d project. These techniques can reach low\/sub-nanosecond time synchronization between processors. In this project, these techniques will be used to develop a practical, compatible, low cost product for nuclear physics applications, i.e. bringing the precision network timing to the front end data acquisition where detector pulses are detected, captured and timestamped. Achievements in Phase I: An existing detector readout module, the Pixie-Net, was adapted in hardware and firmware to tag detector events with timestamps derived from the network time synchronization techniques. It achieved time resolutions in the range of 1300ns to 200ps, depending on signal source, network, and synchronization technique. A concept for software triggering was developed, based on timestamped data rather than hard wired trigger pulses. Plans for Phase II: The Pixie-Net will be upgraded to be fully compatible with the White Rabbit technique, for higher precision, more readout channels, and higher data bandwidth. The software triggering concept will be implemented as an open source data acquisition prototype, for researchers to use as is or to integrate in a larger software framework. For backwards compatibility, converters and adapters to existing shared clock techniques will be developed. Commercial applications and other benefits: The primary benefit of the project is to enable researchers to synchronize detector readout electronics in physically separated systems. This will simplify large nuclear physics experiments, by reducing cabling requirements and by making it easier to merge data streams from different systems (since tagged with universal date\/time). Beyond nuclear physics research, the technique may be used in homeland security (e.g. synchronizing portal monitors) or astrophysics (e.g. synchronizing arrays of cosmic ray detectors). General purpose clock\/trigger adapters may find a market in \u201cground based precision timing\u201d applications such as cellular networks and financial transactions"

        "abstract": "Clouds play leading role in the Earth&apos;s global energy and solar radiation balance. Improving cloud models requires information on the cloud microphysical properties, such as particle size distribution and concentration, cloud composition (droplets, ice particles) and also information on ice crystal shapes (habits). New lightweight and low power instruments for characterization of mixed-phase clouds, suitable for sampling from UAS, tethered balloons, or kite platforms, are needed. This SBIR project continues the development of the Mesa Photonics&apos; in situ optical imaging technology and extends its applicability to mixed-phase cloud characterization. The proposed innovations result in an improved sensitivity and added capability of discriminating between ice particles and water droplets, as well as sizing of droplets in mixed-phase clouds. In addition, the proposed high-resolution hydrometeor imager provides direct complementary information on size and habit of ice particles. The ultimate goal is to develop a technology that is compact, lightweight, low power and inexpensive to make it compatible with small aerial platforms. The Phase I study successfully demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed technical approach, which includes: (1) constructing and characterizing a laboratory prototype of the polarization resolved imaging system capable of discriminating between non-spherical particles and water droplets; (2) demonstrating its performance using a variety of aerosols including salt, ice and dry ice particles as well as mono- and poly-disperse water droplets; (3) building and characterizing a laboratory prototype of a high-resolution imager that provides direct complementary information on the size and shape of non-spherical particles; and (4) identifying the engineering challenges of adapting the technology to small aerial platform and designing flight-ready prototype instrumentation in Phase II. In Phase II, prototypes of the in situ polarization resolved imaging system and the high resolution imager for hydrometeors in mixed phase clouds will be designed, built and characterized. The prototypes will undergo extensive laboratory and field testing, including flight testing on a tethered balloon platform. The successful completion of this Phase I\/II program will lead to development of a mixed cloud characterization technology primarily designed for use on small unmanned aerial platforms. When carried over into Phase III and beyond, this project will be of great benefit to the public and the Federal Government. Precise and extensive cloud characterization data will lead to better understanding of the contribution of atmospheric clouds to Earth\u2019s radiative budget and their effect on the global climate. Flexibility and low cost of the proposed technology will make it compatible with a variety of airborne- and ground-based platforms and suitable for other applications such as characterization of atmospheric aerosols and volcanic ash plumes."

        "abstract": "Redox sensitive heavy metals - chromium, iron, manganese, and copper have attracted a great deal of attention around the world for their impact on human health and environment. It is beneficial to study the temporal dynamics of metal ion concentrations and coupled biogeochemical reactions. Traditional systems are expensive to use with costly and bulky instruments, and are not suitable for field monitoring applications. Statement of how this problem or situation is being addressed The integrated multi-target probes developed during this program are based on 1) arrays of chemical field effect transistor sensor devices, 2) patented molecular-level self-assembly processing techniques that make the individual devices sensitive and selective to specific target molecules, and 3) the incorporation of stripping voltammetry and nafion-based cation-selective transport membranes into the chemical sensors to allow improved sensitivity, selectivity, reliability and prevention of biofouling. What was done in Phase I? During the Phase I, the technical feasibility of the initial scientific hypothesis was proven. It was demonstrated that 1) nanomembrane based single chemical field effect transistor devices can be used for heavy metal detection as individual elements in multi-element chemical sensor arrays, 2) high selectivity to specific heavy metals can be achieved using different, chemically self-assembled interfaces between the sensor element and the material being analyzed, the minimum detection level of these sensors can be lower than 0.01ppm of target materials, 3) the incorporation of stripping voltammetry and nafion-based membranes into the chemical sensors allows for improved sensitivity, selectivity, reliability and biofouling prevention, and 4) a sensor probe can be used to measure and read the concentrations of multiple target chemicals simultaneously. What is planned for Phase II? During the Phase II, practical and reliable chemical sensors for the remote detection and mapping of redox sensitive metal contaminants will be developed. Redox sensitive heavy metal concentrations will be determined by measuring the drain currents of individual chemical field effect transistor elements and the currents of integrated chemically modified working electrodes. The combined information will ensure precise measurement of targets. The bonding chemistries and mechanisms between sensing films and metal ions will be improved. Support electronics to acquire, multiplex, store and process raw sensor data from arrays of such devices will also be developed. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits To allow efficient monitoring of redox sensitive metal levels in water, a fast response, field deployable and highly sensitive measuring instrument is required. The proposed integrated water analysis tool will be a viable commercial product."

        "abstract": "With the discovery of vast quantities of natural gas in shale formations in the U.S. comes the opportunity to convert this gas into value-added chemicals. Practical and cost-effective conversion technologies are needed to more wisely, cleanly (without CO2 production or water consumption) and efficiently use natural gas. As the capital cost of state-of-the art chemical plants continues to grow, smaller distributed modular plants that can be deployed closer to rural gas fields offer economic advantages. Advanced conversion concepts are especially needed to utilize &quot;economically stranded&quot; gas associated with oil production which is wastefully and harmfully flared. These challenges will be addressed by utilizing a novel non-thermal (microwave) plasma process to convert methane into industrial chemicals such as ethylene, acetylene, and others with virtually zero process CO2 emissions, no water consumption, high methane conversion yield, high selectivity, and lower capital costs than existing state of the art. Phase I demonstrated rapid, continuous, direct (single-step) conversion of methane to acetylene, hydrogen, and carbon, as well as the ability to catalytically hydrogenate and\/or polymerize acetylene to higher hydrocarbons including C3s and C4s in an integrated reactor stage without the need for extra hydrogen. This electrically-powered process has low bulk temperatures, proceeds at ambient pressures, emits zero CO2, and can be powered by renewable electricity. The process can target different stream compositions via a change of parameters (e.g. energy inputs, gas flows, compositions, mixing patterns, residence times, and specific reactor configuration). Co-production of high-value, premium carbon products (including graphene platelets) has been demonstrated with clear economic and process advantages over existing state of the art. In the first 6 months of Phase II, a skid-mounted pilot system will be designed and built to evaluate process parameters for industrial scale-up. The system will integrate a modular microwave reactor system without microwave plasma containment (already demonstrated during Phase I) with adequately sized and powered microwave and process gas inputs. In the following 9 months, extensive testing will (i) evaluate key process parameters such as energy efficiency and product yields across a range of conditions and (ii) demonstrate the stability of the process in an industrially relevant setting. Finally, conceptual designs and techno-economics will be developed for several commercial scales, including a next scale demonstration system targeting platform chemicals and premium carbons. The pilot will support future studies and feasibility tests, and will be capable of commercial carbon production at 2 metric ton\/year capacity. With lower-energy requirements than conventional thermal plasmas, reactions in microwave plasmas are driven by electron kinetics rather than thermodynamics, and their non-uniform, non-equilibrium energy distributions allow reaction pathways that are unavailable with conventional chemical or thermal plasma processes. Microwave plasmas also offer reaction intensification that enables reductions in system costs and the production of smaller, portable, modular, reactor systems that can produce industrial chemicals and premium carbons directly from natural gas with less capital and infrastructure expenditure than state of the art. This process could also displace the GHG-intensive ethane and\/or naphtha-cracking and steam-methane reforming processes for industrial production of ethylene, hydrogen, and other chemicals."

        "abstract": "There are increasingly greater legislative, social, and environmental factors motivating the use of clean energy technologies that reduce carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions, with fossil fuel power plants collectively producing the largest fraction of carbon dioxide. The high costs associated with separation are prohibiting the application of carbon capture due to high energy and infrastructure costs and potentially double the cost of electricity ($\/kWh) extended to consumers. A new approach is needed to retrofit existing fossil fuel power plants for cost effective CC&amp;S. The solution: An energy efficient approach to carbon capture will separate CO2 from flue gases while it is still at high temperatures and pressures. Carbon dioxide separation in these conditions has recently emerged with the use of dual phase separation membranes using novel molten electrolyte formulations embedded in a solid phase support. While continued research into appropriate chemistries for the liquid phase is underway, the feasibility of solid phase support materials and their scale up has to larger membrane modules has yet to be addressed. The proposed work addresses the materials, optimization, design and scale up of new dual phase membrane modules that sustainably operate in the heat recovery steam generators (HRSG) cycle power plants. The work: In Phase I, the Luna team targeted solid phase support materials with high strength, increased CO2 separation capabilities, and stability in the presence of the new molten electrolyte formulations. It was critical that these materials were evaluated in context of the HRSG operational conditions to demonstrate their mechanical, thermal, and chemical stability, and their scale up to larger membrane systems. Numerous successes were achieved during this effort, including the scale up of high strength, high stability solid phase support materials with precision manufactured tubular membranes and the demonstration of the highest separation rates recorded for a CO2 membrane. Related fields of research have continually focused on solid and liquid phase materials in dual phase membranes, without consideration of their practical implementation in fossil fuel power plants. Luna Innovations is demonstrating the technical feasibility of a new membrane technology that has the potential to enable cost effective carbon capture from flue gases while integrating directly with HRSGs. In Phase II, Luna will design a multi-tube membrane module that demonstrates both the scalability and performance of the technology. Additional work in optimizing CO2 separation, CFD modeling, and a systems level approach will help to optimize separation performance and integration of the technology in relevant HRSG environments. The benefits: The proposed design and scale up of Luna\u2019s dual phase separation membranes has the potential to facilitate a reduction in the United States\u2019 carbon dioxide emissions by 10-20 % by avoiding tens of billions $US per year in separation costs. A significant reduction in carbon dioxide emissions is expected to have a positive effect on the environment."

        "abstract": "Most of future oil and gas exploration and production will be moving into more challenging environments and directional drilling is an essential technique for tapping the \u201cdifficult\u201d oil and gas deposits. As the key technology that enables directional drilling, geosteering is the act of adjusting the well trajectory on the fly. The goal of geosteering is to increase production, reduce cost and minimize environmental impacts during drilling. Successful geosteering jobs depend on accurate and fast inversion techniques, which reconstruct underground structure based on well logging measurements, to keep the wellbore in a hydrocarbon pay zone. Geosteering inversion in complex underground environments is challenging. This project will provide a low-cost and high-performance solution for the geosteering inversion problem. The related research will impact DOE Office of Fossil Energy by directly addressing the mission to ensure responsible development of America\u2019s oil and gas resources. Under this proposal, Cyentech will develop a geosteering inversion and uncertainty quantification software product that provides proactive guidance for pre-job well placement planning and well trajectory adjustment while drilling. Cyentech accomplishes the above goal through hardening the advanced statistical inversion and uncertainty quantification library, QUESO, developed by DOE\u2019s Scientific Discovery through Advanced Computing (SciDAC) institute. During the Phase I project, we validated the feasibility of using QUESO to solve geosteering inversion problem, tested the scalability in both standalone and parallel computing mode, and built and tested all necessary user interface components for a commercial geosteering software product. The overall objective of Phase II project is to complete the prototype geosteering software product and conduct comprehensive tests using synthetic, laboratory, and field data from collaborating oil operators and oilfield service companies.\nIf the project succeeds, it will lead to a commercial software product for efficient geosteering services. This product will help medium and small size independent oilfield service companies and drilling tool manufacturers of the U.S. to enter the more advanced and lucrative global directional drilling market."

        "abstract": "The advent of sensor networks to gather atmospheric data for weather and climate prediction on large spatial and temporal scales is crucial to the advancement of our understanding of many important processes that make up such predictive models. The height of the atmospheric boundary layer, for example, is used to parameterize boundary layer transport in numerical weather prediction models and boundary layer effects related to fluxes and concentrations of trace gases in inversion models. Increased knowledge of boundary layer structure drives the desire to add the capability to monitor this height to networks. General statement of how this problem is being addressed. The overall objective of the Phase I and II projects is to demonstrate a highly compact, automated, low power ceilometer to make retrievals of cloud base and boundary layer heights from remote unattended sites. The proposed ceilometer incorporates a fiber laser and uses state-of-the-art techniques for environmental stability. The objective will be reached through signal modeling, engineering design, basic laboratory experiments, and field testing of prototypes.What was done in Phase I? In the Phase I program, a design was developed for a compact, automated laser ceilometer that can retrieve both cloud base heights and the height of the atmospheric boundary layer and that will be deployable year round at AmeriFlux network tower sites. A brassboard prototype of the desired size and weight successfully retrieved cloud ceilings with the desired spatial and temporal resolution, thus demonstrating the feasibility of the design. AmeriFlux network site endusers reviewed the ceilometer design, suggested improvements to be incorporated in the Phase II prototype, and performed a mock installation of the brassboard. What is planned for the Phase II project? Several engineering prototypes of the compact ceilometer will be fabricated and then intercompared for performance with a commercial ceilometer. Several prototypes will be deployed at two different AmeriFlux network sites for extended testing, continued intercomparison with commercial ceilometers, and site integration optimization. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits. The proposed compact laser ceilometer will enable measurements of boundary layer and cloud base heights on a wider scale and at higher frequencies than are possible now when deployed at long term measurement sites. Such measurements are fundamental to improving our understanding of the complex couplings between the surface and lower atmosphere and will ultimately help to evolve models used in both weather forecasting and climate change prediction. The sensor is adaptable to deployment in other weather networks, such as the Automated Surface Observing System and other national and state mesonets, where sensor robustness and size are critical to performance."

        "abstract": "Direct-fired supercritical CO2 cycles are an emerging energy conversion technology that promises to increase power plant efficiency while capturing all CO2 emissions. However, given the novelty of the concept, experience is scarce when it comes to the practical design of the respective components. Especially the design of the combustor is challenging at high operating pressures of 200-300 bars, affecting fluid thermodynamics, combustion chemistry, and potentially introducing interactions with turbulence that were less eminent at lower, conventional combustor pressures. How addressed: In order to address these issues, we propose to develop high fidelity low-dissipation simulation capabilities (large eddy simulation computational fluid dynamics) for real fluid reactive mixtures, that can be used to solve practical engineering and design questions for realistically complex geometries. Phase I: The Phase I project involved an extensive evaluation of available models for high pressure thermodynamics, and a study of the sensitivity with respect to the combustion mechanism. Phase I allowed us to demonstrate the successful implementation of real fluid simulation capabilities for high pressure injection on one hand, and reactive simulations of a representative complex swirl injector on the other, based on state-of-the-art models originally developed for rocket combustion chamber simulations. Phase II:The purpose of the Phase II project is to combine these capabilities into a numerical tool that allows practical evaluation on the component level, in a detail that is beneficial for the design and analysis of practical combustor implementations. We intend to pursue a three-pronged approach, based on developing a high fidelity solver using state-of-the-art models for design questions, analyzing sensitivity of chemical and thermochemical models and their impact on flow solutions and predicted combustor performance, and assessing and avoiding the impact of combustion instabilities on effective combustor operation for practical designs.Commercial and other benefits:We expect that the results will advance the state-of-the-art in a number of fields. The successful Phase II project will facilitate an efficient and reliable realization of a direct-fired supercritical CO2 combustor using simulations, thus reducing the number of expensive and potentially dangerous experiments. Specifically, high fidelity simulations are capable of capturing physical phenomena that may degrade combustor performance and reliability, such as peak temperature distributions, acoustics, and thermo-acoustic instabilities. The new model can furthermore be used as a baseline to analyze other high-pressure combustion systems, such as gas turbines, Diesel engines, and rocket engines. Finally, we expect to advance insight into the physical behavior of such combustors, which represent an interaction of flow physics, chemistry, turbulence, and thermodynamics."

        "abstract": "A significant problem in automotive, defense, and other industries is the complexity of setting up and running simulations for various aspects of a design to ensure accuracy, assess failings, and predetermine fatal and non-fatal errors. A high-prole and increasingly important type of simulation is the modeling of crash phenomena, where today&apos;s best methods require millions of dollars of manual labor to set up each simulation using the error-prone process of translating Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models to Finite Element Analysis (FEA) models. This process is tedious and frustrating even for seasoned veterans, and after the analysis model is constructed, it often fails to perform robustly, producing low fidelity or erroneous results. This limits how much the simulation can actually be leveraged to improve the design. The revolutionary toolset developed in this SBIR promises to streamline the CAD design\/FEA simulation workflow, accelerate simulations by up to 500x, and return more accurate results. For larger customers, these advantages translate into savings of millions of dollars per project. This team&apos;s extensive domain experience enables them to deliver fundamentally new approaches to both CAD and FEA, wrapped in a novel multi-user cloud computing framework. Leveraging HPC (high-performance computing) hosted in the cloud, the approach will deliver scalable, customized solutions through an intuitive and simple-to-use web interface. In Phase I, the patented U-spline technology was significantly matured, with promising simulation results. Additionally, the team was able to gain insight from potential customers in the automotive, aerospace, and defense industries regarding the most impactful entry point into their workflows, helping to dene Phase II. This entry point centers around the most demanding aspect of crash simulation: capturing high fidelity structural response to large-scale contact\/impact events in the presence of material failure. To provide a cutting-edge solution to this problem, the team will mature the patented U-spline technology, develop new simulation technology based on isogeometric analysis, and parallelize the technology to prepare for cloud deployment. Customer-proposed benchmark problems will be run to verify the advantages of the approach. This toolset will reduce time-to-market and result in better designs across multiple industries. The multi-user, cloud-based interface will allow engineers to collaboratively design and prepare models for analysis. The proposed methodology will remove error-prone parts of the simulation workflow and improve simulation fidelity. This will simplify the user experience so that even non-experts can run analyses. The team has started and exited a company in this space previously and is well prepared to bring the products and company to success."

        "abstract": "There are abundant, valuable mineral resources available in mixed sea salts, bitterns, and\nbrines. These mineral resources are generally not being exploited because the separating products from these salt mixtures is challenging and cost prohibitive. In some cases, these mixed salt systems are not considered as waste because they have simply been stockpiled and are awaiting a practical processing technology. The salt industry needs a versatile, cost effective process that convert unused mixed salt systems into valuable chemical feedstocks on the scale of millions of tons per year in domestic markets. While many processes have been previously proposed in journal and patent literature, they remain unapplied by the salt industry because they use additives that are costprohibitive at such large scales. As an option, this processing capability should be able to also profitably consume millions of tons of carbon dioxide per year to produce salable carbonate minerals. The solution: Achieve cost effective processing of mixed salt systems by avoiding cost-prohibitive additives and extracting additional products, such as hydrochloric acid. Luna has developed a simple, energy efficient process to separate chemical feedstocks from mixed salt systems with this approach. The Phase I work: Luna developed innovative and effective acid\/base chemistries and materials for dual phase membranes. The hybrid membrane concept was reduced to practice. The Phase II work: Luna will improve the performance and manufacturing of key materials and components and then scale up the separation technology to the benchtop scale. The technical work will be accompanied by process engineering and a detailed techno-economic analysis. This program will result in technology intensification and a well-developed assessment regarding the potential for industrial scale application. The commercial applications and benefits: The large scale production of hydrochloric acid, basic minerals, and other valuable chemicals from previously unusable salt commodities would enhance the productivity of the salt industry, improve resource management, and increase energy efficiency in domestic manufacturing. With potential process scales on the order of several million tons of mixed salt per year, the resulting byproducts of the process will lower the feedstock costs for fertilizer, plastics, water treatment, metal\/steel, paper\/pulp, and carbon sequestration industries."

        "abstract": "With the expanding use of desalination and wastewater remediation to meet the nation\u2019s fundamental water requirements, the critical economic and environmental needs for reducing energy requirements and enhancing operational functionality can be addressed by a supported one-atomic-layer-thick membrane that incorporates the chemical structures to avoid fouling and scaling. The development of novel cyclic organic synthons capable of being used as building blocks for the self-assembly of porous, Langmuir-Film (LF) derived nanomembranes has led to the development of large, supported membranes. The LF derived nanomembranes provide for exquisite solute selectivity and theoretically provide the minimal energy barrier to solvent passage. Development of polymeric FO draw agents will allow purification of salty feedstocks at near minimum energy usage without expensive capital equipment.PHASE 2 We have shown, in our phase 1 proof of concept work that Stimulus Response Polymers (SRP) have a high probability of enabling a nanomembrane based desalination and remediation methods. In Phase II we will synthesize specific SRPs and perform functionality and stability testing on these polymers to determine which are most likely scale-up candidates. COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS AND OTHER BENEFITS The FO polymer is critical for the realization of a low energy desalination process. The oneatomic- layer-thick membranes promise to provide high purity water in desalination, wastewater remediation and water purification applications while providing total cost reductions on the order of 50% and reducing energy needed by 66% for desalination, and 99% for purifications, During a time of increased water scarcity, rising water costs, increased energy consumption for water provision and the need to reduce energy\u2019s environmental impact, this technology provides enhanced water security, reduced energy use, reduced environmental impact, and reduced costs to municipalities, agriculture and a wide range of industries."

        "abstract": "Ceramic RF windows used in power couplers for superconducting cavities are prone to accumulate volume and surface charges. The electric field generated by charging builds up until it discharges, with the resultant arc damaging or destroying the window. How the problem is being addressed: Euclid has developed a new ceramic composition that exhibits low losses at high frequencies but is conductive at DC. This allows the charge to drain off rather than being accumulated in the material.\nWhat was done in Phase I: In Phase I, we synthesized ceramic material based on Mg,Ti oxides having a very low dielectric loss at microwave frequencies and exhibiting two orders (100 times) of magnitude increased conductivity. We developed a set of MgTi ceramic elements for high power 650 MHz RF coupler windows. In addition to the Phase I plan, we also carried out a beam-charging test of the developed ceramic. Excellent performance of the vacuum part of the 650 MHz high power couplers equipped with the MgTi based RF windows was demonstrated with the Multiphysics modeling.What will be done in Phase II: In Phase II of this project, 650 MHz high-power RF windows made of this new ceramic will be fabricated and tested at high power at BNL and FNAL. The MgTi-oxide based ceramic components with improved quality will be fabricated and characterized, the brazing technology will be developed, four high power 650 MHz RF windows will be manufactured and tested as a key component of the high power coupler.Applications and benefits: New low-loss microwave ceramics with a small DC conductivity can eliminate the window charging problem in RF power couplers. Development of new ceramics with desired conductivity and low RF losses will significantly improve the operational reliability of power couplers in superconducting and normal conducting accelerators, and high power vacuum devices."

        "abstract": "Over the last decade, Free Electron Laser (FEL) light sources have become an essential component of the world-wide scientific infrastructure and deliver core research capabilities to Users across many scientific disciplines. However, the conventional FEL efficiency is usually limited to a small fraction of 1% at short wavelengths, which is a significant strain on the light source accessibility and performance. Technical Approach In response to this problem, RadiaBeam Technologies and UCLA are developing a novel concept, TESSA (Tapering Enhanced Stimulated Superradiant Amplification), which carries the promise to increase FEL efficiency by over an order of magnitude. By applying a high intensity radiation seed and a novel, strongtapering algorithm, it was shown numerically that TESSA can achieve an overall efficiency as high as 50%. The TESSA concept has only been validated experimentally at 10 \u03bcm wavelength, and in this project it will be validated in the ultra-violet frequency range. Phase I Accomplishments During the Phase I, a detailed numerical study of the proposed TESSA experiment was carried out, including optimization of the beam dynamics, and TESSA system. The beamline components and subsystems were designed and optimized, with particular effort placed on the initial design and cost engineering of the tapered helical undulator. Phase II Plan Phase I demonstrated feasibility of the proposed TESSA demonstration at 266 nm, and the project is in a high degree of readiness for the transition into Phase II. In Phase II, the experimental system will be fully engineered and fabricated, and in Year 2 the entire system will be integrated and commissioned at the APS LEA facility. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits A successful TESSA demonstration in the ultraviolet frequency range, can lead to development of novel and significant additional capabilities for the FEL Light Source community. It would also trigger a broader interest towards high efficiency FEL sources, including an interest from emerging industrial applications, such as EUV lithography. For RadiaBeam the realization of TESSA concept, represents an exciting and potentially disruptive commercial opportunity."

        "abstract": "Fast evolution of supercomputer architecture lead to an increasingly error-prone, lengthy and costly problem of porting existing applications to new architectures. For a useful category of compute-intensive, loop-based codes such as found in DOE applications, solutions exist that take sequential code and optimize it for modern parallel computers, but these expect a \u201cde-optimized\u201d form as input, which results in users still having to rewrite code. Also they don\u2019t accept some input\nlanguages used in most DOE applications, which are written mostly in the C, C++ and Fortran languages, and increasingly using Deep Learning frameworks. Project Objective The main objective is to turn a tool for automatic parallelization of compute-intensive loop-based C sequential codes into a tool that supports more input languages (C, C++ and Fortran) and Deep Learning codes as inputs. Another objective is to enable new optimizations based on data transformations and alternative parallelization in a leading Deep Learning framework. What was done in Phase I? In Phase I, we enhanced the porting tool front-end capabilities to: - enable the intake of a significant subset of C++ (mostly excludes Exceptions and atomics);- carry parallelism-related user annotations semantics through to the polyhedral representation of the program, in whichthe program is optimized;- automatically approximate irregular program constructs such as indirect array accesses;- automatically approximate array accesses performed during function calls -- including library calls -- within parallelizable code regions Commercial Applications and Other Benefits Portacy will provide the immediate benefit of being able to generate versions of applications for new accelerators from sequential and code parallelized using traditional parallel programming models. It will also enhance the performance of distributed Deep Learning codes. The degree to which a larger range of Deep Learning codes will be optimized will also increase with the use of the Portacy tool."

        "abstract": "Synchrotron-based science has had a great scientific impact and will continue to have great impact going forward. For high brightness 3rd and 4th generation light sources, errors are almost completely due to distortion in the front-end optics caused by the high heat loads generated by the broadband radiation from the insertion device. Diamond offers a solution because of its low x-ray absorption and stability under high heat loads. Diamond grown with chemical vapor deposition (CVD) has been found to be an excellent material for detector applications and diamond-based detectors have been made for use with a variety of particles including heavy ions, electrons, neutrons, protons, and photons including UV and x-rays.Combining these thermal and electronic properties of diamond would provide a number of benefits for optical elements in an x-ray beamline. Knowing the beam flux through the optic allows one to place the maximum of the beam at the optic or to move the lens to the maximum. In the case of pulsed sources, the signal from a diamond optic acts as a timing signal for synchronization or provide better pulse-to-pulse normalization. Delaware Diamond Knives has produced a prototype refractive lens from single crystal diamond whose performance approached that of today\u2019s commercially available optics. During Phase I, we prepared diamond refractive lenses, applied platinum electrical contacts to them and measured the signals from the lenses while moving them in the ISR beamline at NSLS-II. We concluded that the signals were sensitive enough to be useful in optimizing the position of the lens within the beam. During Phase II, we will build a prototype automatic lens positioning system, use this system for further testing of lens and system performance, make further improvements in the optical performance of the lens, develop low-Z contacts to reduce absorption, develop a number of other lens types and incorporate what we\u2019ve learned into a final commercial design. The proposed approach has the potential for a significant impact on materials research at synchrotron facilities around the world. It solves an immediate and pressing problem for users of 3rd and 4th generation light sources by non-invasively providing flux and position information during experiments."

        "abstract": "Bioethanol has come into widespread use as fuel additives worldwide, especially in the U.S. and Brazil, aiming to mitigate CO2 emissions by up to 70% and sustain the carbon-neutral ecosystem. Generally, bioethanol in various fermentation broths has a maximum concentration of 6-8 wt.%. Hence, concentration of bioethanol from dilute streams poses a grand challenge from the standpoint of energy efficiency. In bioethanol dehydration processes, the conventional distillation process is adopted, followed by energy-intensive pressure swing adsorption (PSA) dehydration process. Many bioethanol plants in the U.S. ran the PSA process more than 10 years ago, and will require adsorbent bed retrofitting in next several years. Energy-efficient membrane separation technologies are considered a highly cost-competitive alternative to PSA\nprocess for bioethanol concentration &amp; purification. However, in order for these membrane technologies to become incorporated into real-world applications, focused R&amp;D needs to be conducted in order to increase the technical feasibility and to lower the cost of implementation. In Phase I, nGimat had already made great progress in generating high-separation-performance NaA zeolite membranes on cheap porous supports. It is anticipated that the production cost of these membranes be at least 50% lower than zeolite membranes available nowadays, and play a critical role in reaching the cost objective of $0.02-0.09\/L of bioethanol. Development of such low-cost NaA zeolite membranes will require distinct innovations in substrate pretreatment, gel formulation, and membrane module design to outperform the current state-of-the-art zeolite membranes. During Phase I, nGimat (1) pretreated zeolite\/metal support composites in a low-cost way; and (2) prepared NaA zeolite membranes with superior separation performance. It is calculated that our newly designed zeolite membranes have a rather high membrane surface area to volume ratio, promising a high packing density in a membrane module. Overall, key improvements pursued in this effort were reflected by overcoming prohibitively high production cost of these membranes, and a significant energy saving of about 20-40%, as compared to conventional separation technologies such as distillation + PSA, is expected. Phase II of this SBIR effort will be concentrated on further optimization and scale-up production of the best-performing NaA zeolite membranes to meet the demand of energy efficiency."

        "abstract": "The next generation DOE physics accelerator, The Electron Ion Collider (EIC) will collide spin oriented electrons and ions with unprecedented focus at the interaction point. For accelerator operators to maintain these spin polarized beams they must have a way to noninvasively measure spin orientation as the beam travels through the accelerator. To achieve the\nunprecedented focus at the collision point, a magnetized beam of electrons will be recycled to cool the ions and improve their focus. To manage and maintain this magnetized beam, accelerator operators need non-invasive real-time beam magnetometers. Accelerator operators and designers currently do not have real time, non-invasive polarization monitors, or bunch magnetometers, and no direct way to automate polarization quality optimization or beam magnetization in real time. The Thomas Jefferson National Laboratory (JLAB), Cornell\u2019s Laboratory of Elementary-Particle Physics (LEPP) and, Electrodynamic, have joined together in a collaboration dedicated to finding solutions to this urgent need. During phase I a prototype resonant polarimeter was installed on CEBAF and beam measurement with it using a phase sensitive receiver were extremely informative but inconclusive. The experience defined the experimental challenges and informed the design and development of new experimental apparatus that was constructed during Phase I and will be installed at JLAB in the first months of Phase II. Since Phase I concluded, two new beamlines have become available for testing resonant polarimeters and magnetometers. A polarized beam line at Jlab\u2019s Upgrade Injector Test Stand and a magnetized beamline on Jlab\u2019s Gun test stand (GTS). Experiments are planned at both of these facilities and again at CEBAF during this Phase II. This Phase II SBIR will develop non-invasive, real-time, resonant polarimeters and magnetometers that will improve the optimization and control of spin polarized and magnetized beams. Commercial Applications: Low-noise phase sensitive receivers have many applications in charged particle acceleration including polarimetery and high resolution beam position monitoring. The hardware in development has applications in several facilities."

Its future upgrade calls for the implementation of electron cooling strategies, where ultra-cold electron beams will be generated by photoinjectors. The photocathode, where the electron beam is produced, is required to deliver a significantly high average current (~50 mA) to meet the upgrade requirement. Bialkali cathodes are capable of delivering this high average current, however, based on their lifetimes, they have to be replaced daily. Hence, there\u2019s a need for commercially-available photocathodes than can be produced reliable and supplied in sufficient quantities.How this problem is being addressed: To address this problem, RMD proposed to develop a reliable manufacturing method for bialkali cathodes and for successful sealing\/unsealing them in transportable cartridges. By doing so, these cathodes can be mass produced and stockpiled for their daily use at RHIC. The sealed cathodes can be unsealed at the accelerator and handed off easily to a photoinjector gun to produce the electron beam with the desired emittance and brightness.What is to be done in Phase II: The program described in this SBIR seeks to integrate a revolutionary cathode growth method proven for its high volume manufacturing with a reliable cathode sealing technology to provide transportable cathodes for the electron cooler. Specifically, RMD will design and build a cathode growth system, which can reliable produce bialkali cathodes, measure the QE and seal them in a transportable cartridge. Later, these cathodes will be unsealed to re-measure their QE and handed off to a DC gun to produce electron beam and measure its lifetime and current.Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: Key advantage of industrial production and availability of photocathodes is to meet the needs of the burgeoning ultra-fast electron diffraction community. The proposed technology can also disrupt the commercial photocathode manufacturing if QE &gt;40% can be realized, which will boost US\u2019s market share in cathode manufacturing. The technology will enable cost effective photocathode deposition over large areas, which will impact the realization of cost competitive new detectors such as the Large Area Picosecond Photo Detectors (LAPPDs). Availability of such detectors will have a profound impact on medical investigations using PET, tomographic x-ray imaging, border security investigations, scattering neutron detectors for spallation sources to perform basic sciences, deep underground neutrino experiments (DUNE), or the large water neutrino detection systems. The proposed technology could not only streamline the supply of commercial cathodes for accelerators at various national labs but also bring cutting-edge physics into small industries and university labs."

        "abstract": "As computational density for high-performance computing and big-data services continues to scale, performance scalability of next generation computing systems is becoming increasingly constrained by limitations in memory access, power dissipation and chip packaging. The processor-memory communication bottleneck, a major challenge in current multicore processors due to limited pin-out and power budget, presents a detrimental scaling barrier to data-intensive computing. General statement of how this problem is being addressed: A consortium team of small businesses and leading researchers that includes experts from photonics processor-memory architecture, III\/V photonic laser design\/fabrication, silicon photonics design\/fabrication, photonics packaging and assembly, and FPGA-based high-performance memory controller IP development \u2013 to collaboratively develop a commercialization path for a Photonic Memory Controller Module (P-MCM). What was done in Phase I: Columbia University coordinated the working group and subgroups to provide the system architecture and specifications for each small business consortium team members. Columbia developed high performance memory controller IPs and interfaces in FPGAs platform. Freedom Photonics developed the programmable, tunable laser using mature InP\/GaAs processing. Analog Photonics developed the photonic transceiver and interconnect fabrics using silicon photonic processing. PLC Connections packaged the photonic transceiver and interconnect fabric chips and tunable laser chips and provide a low-loss and robust optical coupling mechanism. What is planned for the Phase II project: Columbia University will continue to coordinate the working group and subgroups to provide the system architecture and specifications for each small business consortium team members. Columbia will update high performance memory controller IPs and interfaces in FPGAs platform to meet Phase II goals and perform a final end-of-Phase II P-MCM demonstration. Freedom Photonics will develop and package a 17-channel integrated source laser array. Analog Photonics will design, fabricate and package switch, photonic transceiver, driver IC and interconnect fabrics using silicon photonic processing. PLC Connections will develop high density, low cost I\/O packaging technology to interconnect the ICs and components developed in this program using dense fiber arrays to provide a low-loss and robust optical coupling mechanism and deliver packaged prototypes to Columbia for system integration and demonstration. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: The Photonic Memory Controller developed have wide commercial applications in data center and telecom markets."

        "abstract": "Many emerging technologies in solar energy, electronics, and biophysics require a deep understanding of the behavior of materials on the nanoscale. Recent advances in high resolution chemical imaging show great promise for improving the resolution of widely applicable chemical imaging techniques. We propose to develop a commercial, tunable, low-noise, ultrashort pulse laser source with sub-diffraction illumination capabilities that will help make super resolution chemical imaging available to a broad range of scientists. Our approach is to build an optical parametric amplifier (OPA) based on our commercial fiber laser platform. This OPA will be added as additional layer on the existing fiber laser, keeping the footprint small. Two complimentary approaches to resolution enhancement will be investigated, and the higher-performing method integrated into the source, allowing us to end the program with a design for a fully packaged, turn-key, specifically-tailored tunable ultrafast source for subdiffraction illumination ready to be sold to academic markets and beyond. In Phase I, we constructed a laser source and, with our collaborators, demonstrated super resolution imaging. Through these imaging demos, we identified laser noise and repetition rate as limiting factors in imaging speed and quality. In Phase II, we will address these issues by increasing the repetition rate by and order of magnitude, and substantially decreasing laser noise. We will also demonstrate a novel, alternate approach to super resolution imaging, that, if successful, will substantially simplify the architecture, further lowering cost and complexity. Such a compact, robust, easy to use source for tunable, high-resolution chemical imaging could displace some users from large, complicated, and costly bulk laser solutions. Many researchers could benefit from such a system, improving image quality and enabling rapid development of next generation nanotechnology in fields as diverse as energy, electronics, and pharmacology."

        "abstract": "One of the overarching goals of the Department of Energy\u2019s Biological and Environmental Research (DOE- BER) program is the quantification of biogeochemical processes in complex subsurface environments at the Hanford Reach of the Columbia River in Washington and East River flood plain in Colorado. The models informed by this data are useful for predicting both short- and long-term changes to economically important ecosystems. Distributed sensors for dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration measurement are needed within river corridors. These settings are of particular interest because of the important role DO plays in catalyzing a diversity of environmentally important biogeochemical reactions. Additional the need for soil- or sediment-based DO sensors is every bit as great as for aqueous environments. Currently no viable and\/or reliable DO probe exists on the market for making such measurements, which are critically important for a wide variety of researchers and scientists. How this Problem or Situation is Being Addressed We are deploying dissolved oxygen sensors for autonomous (hands-off) monitoring of across an entire ecosystem over the period of many months. What was done in Phase I In Phase I we established the first version of a remote sensing station in the East River, Colorado watershed in collaboration with our LBNL colleagues. The Aquifer Sampling Tube Network was instrumented at the Colorado River by our PNNL colleagues. We built and tested the flow cell for the Network manifold. The details of instrumentation deployment are in place for the spring deployment. What is planned for Phase II of project This proposal involves the Scientific Focus Areas (SFA) managed by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) and the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL). At the Berkeley Lab\u2019s Watershed Function SFA the focus will be on quantifying seasonal variations in pore water DO within two critical components of the East River, Colorado, watershed: (a) streambed sediments undergoing hyporheic exchange with river water and (b) hillslope soils impacted by transient inputs of snowmelt. Investigations at the PNNL site will deploy sensors into the sediments in the variably saturated zone to capture the O2 dynamics during the transition times between saturated\/unsaturated conditions. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits DO measurements provide critical information for many areas, including water-quality assessment and groundwater contamination modeling. Opti O2\u2019s sensor will improve data gathering performance and reduce cost. These technological developments will also enable the deployment of ecosystem-scale DO sensing networks that will provide information critical to the improvement of predictive ecosystem models."

Instruments should be significantly more portable and require less power than what is currently available. The analyzers need to be suitable for field work and laboratory studies. How This Problem is Being Addressed: Rugged, compact, low power, and reasonably priced instruments will be developed for simultaneous measurements of at least six key gases (carbon dioxide, methane, water vapor, oxygen, nitrogen, and nitrous oxide). Commercial instruments will be fully automated and operate without requiring consumable supplies. What is to be done in Phase II? A prototype multiple gas analyzer will be developed and field tested in Phase II. Field tests will be performed at DOE\u2019s East River site. Evaluations will emphasize long term stability. Carbon dioxide, methane, water vapor, oxygen, and nitrogen will be measured simultaneously using one optical method. Nitrous oxide and carbon monoxide will be measured using a different optical technique. Commercial Applications: Direct measurement of multiple soil gases including nitrogen now requires multiple analyzers. Commercial gas analyzers will be suitable for field studies including long-term continuous monitoring of nitrogen-cycle and carbon-cycle processes. Specific end user applications include characterizing biologic respiration, CH4 oxidation, dissolution of CO2, reaction with soil carbonate, and atmospheric mixing.

These high-performance computing systems are frequently geographically distributed and exposed to the Internet, making them attractive resources for misuse and cyberattack. As high-performance computing systems grow even more popular and more widely distributed, simply firewalling and isolating a system is no longer feasible as a solution.\nStatement of how this Problem or Situation is Being Addressed. HOST is a software service that manages high-performance computing resource management activities in order to deceive users that are acting maliciously. HOST applies innovative deception techniques to distributed computing systems, adding tools that facilitate the configuration of cyber deception behaviors as security policies.

        "abstract": "When managing ecosystems &amp; water resources and for applications in precision agriculture, there is a need for improved methods to economically measure and monitor soil moisture versus depth below the surface. There is also a need to properly incorporate these measurements with data from other existing sensors to improve the calibration of complex hydro-biogeochemical models. Addressing the Problem \u2013 A prototype novel miniature ground penetrating synthetic aperture radar will be built to provide precise and accurate measurements of soil moisture versus depth below the surface. The radar\u2019s miniaturized size allows deployment on small aircraft and unmanned air vehicles as well as drones. The use of these small platforms results in cost effective operation to allow soil moisture to be measured frequently to monitor changes over short time periods. A new data assimilation framework will be developed to merge the soil moisture profiles with other airborne imagery and point sensor data to generate physically-based hydrological models to improve the estimation of soil hydraulic parameters and evapotranspiration. Phase I Work Completed \u2013 A small synthetic aperture radar breadboard was developed and bench- tested. Another synthetic aperture radar was used to collect airborne data over an area saturated with water via a controlled water release. The data collected was processed to provide a remote measurement of soil moisture. Preliminary development work was done on a new data assimilation framework. Phase II Work Planned \u2013 Build a fully functional prototype of a miniature synthetic aperture radar to measure soil moisture versus depth. Airborne SAR data will be collect airborne data at several field sites outfitted with ground-based soil moisture sensors to establish ground truth. The data will be processed to provide soil moisture profiles. A new data assimilation framework will be developed and used to merge the moisture profiles with ground-based point sensors and optical\/IR imagery to generate improved physically-based hydrological models of the subsurface. Benefits &amp; Commercial Applications \u2013 The developed capabilities will benefit researchers who study and model ecosystems and hydrological processes. The project will provide soil moisture data with high spatial resolution and allow monitoring at high temporal rates to help improve ecosystem modeling &amp; understanding of hydrological processes. The soil moisture data and monitoring capability will have strong, commercial applications in precision agriculture, which will provide significant benefits to society by reducing growers\u2019 application of water and chemicals to their fields while increasing crop productivity."

        "abstract": "High production cost remains the major barrier to commercialization of bio-based products. Using organic wastes as feedstock offers a promising option because of additional benefits in environmental protection and resource conservation. The goal of this project is to overcome the economic barrier by building an innovative waste to chemical (W2C) technology platform that produces biopolymers from organic wastes with high yield at low cost. Success in this project has the potential to advance enabling technologies, accelerate the development of the bio-based industry and maximize biochemicals production from organic waste streams. The project goal will be achieved by synergizing the unique advantage of anaerobic digestion (AD) and the development in synthetic biology. The AD process funnels various forms of organic carbons in the waste into simple intermediate volatile fatty acid (VFA) molecules. The novel synthetic pathway allows using the VFAs directly as building block to biologically synthesis polymer molecules efficiently without producing by-product. Innovative integration of both steps assures high efficient utilization of carbon for the synthesis of target products with high overall yield and productivity. This technology also takes the advantages of mixed microbial community in the AD process and the oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica as a cell factory."

The technical approach will leverage best-in-class technologies, and strategically develop new approaches to build an open source platform for chemical-physics simulations, data, and analytics. Features will be developed using a scripting language to glue components together on the server-side, with compiled programs providing optimized implementations and access to existing approaches. The client application will offer a rich, responsive experience using modern web technologies exposed in an electronic notebook interface. The Phase I project developed a prototype software platform with an electronic notebook interface that supported a popular scripting language. It offered search and data analytics, using modern web technologies to deliver interactive visualization of chemical data in the web-based electronic notebook. It scheduled simulations, and made data in the notebook available over the web using web programming interfaces, and in a web page for wider dissemination. The Phase II project will develop a software platform that serves researcher\u2019s needs, offering a data-centric server coupled with an electronic notebook interface, and a modern web application to aid in wider dissemination. It will integrate with major computational facilities to schedule simulations, extract relevant data, and make it available in a form that can be searched, shared, and with reproducibility as a primary driver for chemical-physics simulations. Data representations will be developed and extended, and experimental data used to augment predictive capabilities of in-silico simulations coupled with approaches from machine learning. This project will leverage investments made by the DOE and other agencies to provide a powerful software platform and electronic notebook for the materials design community. It will create a platform that can serve as a reference for the community. The use of permissive open source licensing will make the platform available to all, with a simple deployment strategy offering the ability to keep data close yet make it available to the wider linked semantic web. Instances at national facilities, universities, and the cloud will be made available using Software as a Service (SaaS) models for the cloud instance."

        "abstract": "Wastewater from oil and gas production has high total dissolved solids (TDS) and organics and needs to be treated for safe disposal or reuse. Coal-fired power plant discharges and mining effluents share similar high TDS and organic contents. This project targets the development of an energy efficient, and robust supercritical desalination technology to treat hypersaline solutions, destroying organics and separating saltwater into a pure water stream and valuable recovered solids, with zero liquid discharge (ZLD). In Phase I of the project, Envergex, with its partner University of North Dakota, will use laboratory-based testing to demonstrate proof-of-concept of the supercritical water purification process. We will test the novel reactor design for effective salt separation. We will study the effect of the proprietary additives on alleviating fouling issues in the supercritical water reactor and reducing energy requirements. Phase II work will involve testing at the pilot-scale level of the proposed concept using produced water from an operating oil\/gas fracking well. Scale-up and collaborations for commercial demonstration will be explored."

Riptide proposes this new Persistent Environmental Measurement AUV (PEM-AUV) would fully satisfy PMA-290s stated objectives, but would also provide a flexible, mobile capability for future developing missions. Mobility of the platform would also allow PMA-290 to position and reposition the PEM-AUV as desired, eliminating or reducing the impact of currents in the region of interest.The primary objective of the Phase I effort will be to develop the optimized vehicle solution capable of meeting or exceeding PMA-290s stated goals for persistent environmental measurement. A design trade will be conducted across a range of parameters with PMA-290s input on threshold and objective criteria. Riptide anticipates providing a mobile capability able to conduct multiple profiles per day for one month or more."

        "abstract": "Ultrafast electron microscopy using relativistic electron beams requires very short beams of exquisite quality for maximum contrast at submicron scales with fast time resolution. State-of the-art microscopy systems are based on radiofrequency photocathode technology where the accelerating gradient, and thus the beam quality, is limited by breakdown of the copper walls. RadiaBeam Technologies plans to use a dielectric loaded waveguide driven by a low energy electron beam to drive a strong wakefield. In the wakefield a diffuse gas will be ionized at the appropriate location to produce a very low emittance electron beam which will be accelerated to several MeV. This system functions as an electron beam quality transformer, producing a short electron beam of higher quality than available with radiofrequency photocathode technology. During Phase I, we advanced the theoretical and simulation models of the concept to the point where we could plan a proof-of-principle experiment. This work has shown the superlative quality of the electron beam from our system, especially the very short time duration. The Phase II project is to show that the acceleration principle that we have developed will work experimentally and can be adapted to a commercial system. In addition to the body of experimental work to be accomplished, we are also planning more simulations to further develop our infrastructure for modeling.Commercial Applications and Other Benefits\nThe principal users of this technology are industrial and university-scale researchers in materials development and basic science. The tools developed to perform the proof-of-principle experiment will be of general interest to the accelerator physics community. In addition, this technology might find use in multi-user light sources or basic energy science colliders."

        "abstract": "This technology addresses the need for a cost effective, simple and environmentally benign process to replace the current electroless nickel coating on Neutrino Focusing Horns, which are made of aluminum. One big challenge for depositing a coating on aluminum is that a special pretreatment is required owing to aluminum\u2019s highly reactive nature. Even though the electroless nickel coating has been the most successful thus far for Neutrino Focusing Horns, the complexity and environmental concerns regarding the large amounts of hazard chemical usage for pretreatment have triggered the need for a different process. This program is developing a simple, electrochemical approach that consists of sequential pretreatment and electrodeposition process steps to clean and prepare the aluminum surface and subsequently directly electrodeposit a hard nickel coating on the aluminum horn surface. The coating process is more cost effective, less complex and uses a smaller volume of chemicals than the electroless nickel coating for aluminum Neutrino Focusing Horns. Phase I demonstrated the feasibility of pulse reverse electrochemical pretreatment followed by direct electrodeposition of nickel onto aluminum. The entire process comprised 5 steps in comparison to the 16 steps required for electroless nickel deposition. The potential was shown to meet the required properties for adhesion, hardness, and corrosion. Preliminary estimates show the potential for at least a 50% cost saving compared to electroless nickel for a sub-scale component, with more significant savings anticipated for full-size parts. The Phase II project will further develop and validate an electrodeposited nickel coating with similar or better performance than the current electroless nickel coating. Phase II will optimize the pretreatment process to facilitate low-cost manufacturing, optimize the electrodeposition process to achieve the desired wear and corrosion resistance and hardness, design racking and tooling and build alpha-scale electrochemical cells to achieve the desired coating uniformity across the part and process prototype-size components, and finalize the economics and transition plan.Commercial Applications and Other Benefits\nDirect electroplating on aluminum alloys is of critical importance to industry. The proposed electrodeposition technology has the potential to positively impact society by reducing hazard chemical usage, and enhance the usage of the aluminum in various applications. The technology will be adapted to other applications that require electrodeposited coatings on passive metals such as aluminum, titanium and stainless steels."

        "abstract": "The feasibility of fusion as a practical energy source needs to be improved significantly by removing some of the restrictions that low-temperature superconductors put on the fusion magnet systems. One method to simplify the magnet system is by using high-temperature superconductors that allow for more compact magnet systems with higher performance and much larger temperature margins. The compact, high-field magnet systems require highcurrent, flexible cables wound from high-temperature superconductors that are highly transposed to enable low-loss field ramping and safer magnet operation. There are currently no highly transposed, flexible magnet cables that would enable compact, high-field fusion machines. This proposal seeks to develop low-loss, flexible, high-current magnet cables wound from hightemperature superconductors, allowing development of compact, high-field fusion magnets. During Phase I, we\u2019ve demonstrated the clear feasibility of developing highly transposed multi strand cables wound from CORC\u00ae wires that would carry 50 \u2013 100 kA in a field of 20 T. We\u2019ve demonstrated the ability to operate the cable without any significant degradation due to mechanical stresses, even after 100,000 stress cycles, and during bending to 1 meter diameter. During Phase II we will manufacture full-size magnet cables for compact fusion magnets and demonstrate their performance at 80 kA in a 10.8 T background field. If successful, the program will result in high-quality cables for compact fusion magnets that are highly transposed to allow low-loss field ramping, safe operation even during magnet quench, with no performance degradation. These cables would enable a rapid development of compact fusion magnets.Commercial Applications and Other Benefits\nReliable, low-loss, flexible high-temperature superconducting magnet cables will enable compact fusion magnets that operate at high fields. These cables will directly benefit other applications, such as high-field scientific and detector magnets."

        "abstract": "The Department of Energy (DOE) Office of High Energy Physics Research supports user facilities studying dark energy. The facilities include ground-based telescopes that would benefit from the availability of semiconductor focal planes with sensitivity ranging into the infrared. Greater infrared sensitivity will provide observation of red-shift data on the largest possible number of astronomical objects. The manufacture of germanium CCDs now appears possible. The addition of high-purity germanium as the substrate for the CCDs will greatly improve the sensitivity and manufacture of these CCDs. High-purity 150-mm diameter semiconductor-quality high-purity germanium wafers are being developed to fill this need. During Phase I, high-purity germanium crystals were grown, sliced, lapped, polished, and shaped into standard form-factor 150-mm diameter semiconductor wafers 675 microns thick. Preliminary testing of these wafers indicates compatibility with the processing required to make them into CCDs. Phase II will see more high-purity wafers produced and tested under varied crystal-growth conditions to develop high-purity germanium substrates that can be fabricated into working CCDs. The goal is to demonstrate working high-purity germanium CCDs by the end of Phase II.Commercial Applications and Other BenefitsThe crystal-growth variations to be researched during Phase II will have direct positive impact on the DOE high-energy physics programs with collateral benefits to satellite-based research and tactical imagers. In addition, the crystal research will positively impact the manufacture of germanium gamma-ray detectors for nuclear security, nuclear research and nuclear-medicine applications."

        "abstract": "Klystrons are the most commonly used RF sources for high energy accelerators. Their efficiency significantly impacts the acquisition and operating cost of accelerator systems. Higher efficiency RF sources are required to reduce the cost for future accelerators and colliders. Calabazas Creek Research Inc., in collaboration with SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, is developing a method for optimizing klystron efficiency and applying it to the design of a high-power klystron for a DOE-relevant accelerator project. The research includes the development of codes using a combination of synthesis and simulation, coupled with advance optimization techniques. Computational designs were achieved with efficiencies exceeding 85%. The program investigated two approaches predicted to achieve high efficiency and evaluated trade-offs between the approaches. A design was selected that achieves efficiency exceeding 85% with the simplest circuit configuration. The klystron design will be optimized using several design codes to verify the computational performance. The optimum design will be used to generate the mechanical design, and a prototype klystron will be built and tested at high power.\nCommercial Applications and Other BenefitsKlystrons are used in many applications, including medical and industrial accelerators, radar, communication, and defense systems. Increased efficiency will result in less expensive devices by reducing fabrication as well as reducing power supply and operating costs."

        "abstract": "This SBIR develops novel long-range passive Electromagnetic (EM) tags based on high-frequency microwaves, down to the millimeter wave regime. EM waves can go through fabrics, plastics, wood, and other occlusions for addressing covert target tracking. These higher frequency bands have many of the best features of the radio and the optical wavelengths, such as the ability to create focused beams to span long distances, potentially many kilometers. Initial tag\/reader design at the 5.8 GHz band was selected for proof of concept and due to the low cost and off-the-shelf availability of components. While future work will examine higher frequency designs, the excellent results at 5.8 GHz established an initial path forward. To enable battery-free tags, efficient energy harvesting at the tag is being implemented. Phase I focused on simulation and analysis, laboratory hardware development, including assessment, optimization, and testing. In Phase II, DSI will optimize RF system performance, test in real environments, and identify initial targeted applications. In Phase III, DSI\u2019s RF tags and integrated tag\/sensors will be mass manufactured and made available to the government and industry for operational use. Major accomplishments included: 1) design, fabrication and test of a prototype 5.8 GHz RF tag and transmitter; 2) demonstration of a record 1 Km range operation for a passive tag system, 3) concepts for enhanced designs at 5.8 GHz including adding ID information and integration with sensors, 4) plans for exploring higher frequency tags beginning at 24 GHz, and 5) identification of numerous important applications for government and then commercial uses beginning in Phase II. In Phase II, we plan to build on the successful Phase I results which achieved 1 Km range for passive RF tag design. We will expand and improve on the 5.8 GHz tag prototype, examine 24 GHz and higher frequency designs and higher (into the mmW regime), add features including tag ID and sensor integration, and aggressively pursue many of the promising applications which emerged in Phase I.Commercial Applications and Other Benefits\nInitial applications will focus on developing custom Km-range tag solutions for selected NNSA and DOE applications. We will then broaden into DoD and other US government applications to be identified and prioritized by Phase II. Following that, we will address numerous commercial applications including passive sensor\/tag systems for civil infrastructure, asset management\/tracking, solar energy status sensors, and many others."

        "abstract": "One of the most exciting recent developments in superconducting RF technology has been the discovery of a nitrogen-doping process which can reliably increase the superconducting quality factor of niobium resonators well above 1010 at high frequency (&gt;1 GHz). This process is now well demonstrated in particular for TESLA-style 9-cell cavities at 1.3 GHz. Nitrogen doping is part of the plan for the production of the cavities for LCLS-II, significantly increasing the cryogenic efficiency of the machine, and allowing significant capital cost reductions. This Phase II proposal will expand the application of nitrogen doping to the low-frequency regime. Niowave is currently developing commercial superconducting electron linacs for a number of important applications including high-power free-electron lasers, the production of medical and industrial radioisotopes, materials processing, sterilization, and cargo scanning applications. These systems typically operate at 350 MHz, but at 4 Kelvin operating temperature, where reduction of BCS losses would be an important efficiency enhancement. Pushing commercial linacs into a regime where a small cryocooler could provide for the cryogenic load of the accelerating cavity would have a huge impact. In this project, Niowave would send a 350-MHz niobium resonator to Fermilab and Cornell University for nitrogen doping and a vertical test to demonstrate high quality factor. The collaboration would then proceed toward a full accelerator demonstration with beam, which would demonstrate the preservation of the high-quality factor through the cryomodule installation, coupler installation, and operation with high-power electron beam."

        "abstract": "Substantial improvements to the integrity of residential building envelopes have been realized in recent years with the use of advanced house wraps, fenestration, and air sealing technologies. While tight construction significantly lowers residential energy consumption, the concomitant reduction in natural ventilation results in less frequent air turnover that can adversely impact indoor air quality and occupant comfort. The addition of mechanical exhaust ventilation may improve comfort and air quality through increased air circulation and contaminant dilution, but without conditioning of the make-up air, the infiltration of cold dry air in the winter and hot humid air in the summer can significantly increase HVAC loads. An energy recovery ventilator (ERV) that transfers heat and moisture between supply and exhaust air streams will be developed and demonstrated in the proposed program. The ventilator utilizes a high performance, low-cost water-permeable membrane to substantially increase ERV efficiency while simultaneously reducing ERV cost. A scalable method for producing a low-cost membrane that transfers humidity at over three times the flux of existing membranes was demonstrated. Membrane performance and durability was demonstrated over a wide range of conditions of relevance to ERV operation. The performance of ERV cores that incorporate the membrane was modeled, and ERV life-cycle energy and cost savings were predicted. Membrane chemistry will be optimized in order to ensure that the membrane exceeds all of the requirements of residential and commercial ERV systems. The membrane fabrication process will be scaled up in order to support the design and assembly of multiple next-generation ERV cores. The cores will be installed in full-scale residential ERV systems and multiple demonstrations will be conducted.Commercial Applications and Other Benefits\nDevelopment of the proposed energy recovery ventilator will significantly increase the life cycle cost savings and shorten the payback period associated with ERV use, thereby accelerating residential and commercial ERV adoption throughout the U.S. The membrane technology is also well-suited to other moisture management applications, including humidifiers, medical equipment, pharmaceuticals, fuel cells, and sensors."

        "abstract": "For electric vehicles to be widely adopted as a common mode of transportation, the price of the battery packs must be reduced to $125 per kilowatt hour. Prices are currently around $200 per kilowatt our. One path to reduced cost per kilowatt hour is by reducing cathode cost and improving their energy density. Cathode materials account for up to 25% of the battery pack cost. Cost reductions can be achieved by reducing raw material costs, reducing production costs, and increasing specific capacity of cathode materials with nickel rich materials. Cathode materials will be manufactured with a single-step continuous microwave-generated plasma materials processing technology (UniMelt\u2122) The processing technique processes each precursor droplet within the same thermal path and thermal history, leading to tight control of phase purity, size and size distribution, and performance of the product for cost effective manufacture of commercially relevant quantities of cathodes for electric vehicle batteries. Phase I work successfully met the defined objectives to validate the feasibility and versatility of UniMelt as a low-cost high-performance production method capable of producing commercially viable materials for lithium ion batteries in electric vehicles. Traditional and high energy Ni-rich cathode materials were produced using the UniMelt process, and their electrochemical performance was verified. The proposed Phase II work is aimed to reduce battery cost per kilowatt hour by: (i) demonstrating process scale-up, (ii) validating the proposed cost-models, (iii) strengthening US-based cathode end-user relationships\/collaborations aimed at continuing this work beyond the Phase II timeline and into commercial production. For this Phase II project, the cathode materials of focus are high nickel content materials which are the current and upcoming industry standard rechargeable lithium batteries. Lower cost batteries help enable further adoption of sustainable technologies such as electric vehicles and grid energy storage where the purchase price per item is strongly related to the battery prices. Success of the proposed work will help reduce the overall usage of fossil fuels throughout the US and world."

        "abstract": "It is expected that advanced and additive manufacturing will substantially reduce deployment times of the Small Modular Reactor (SMR). Some estimates predict that deployment schedules could be accelerated by up to 6 months while reducing component fabrication costs by 20% or more through the adoption of advanced and additive manufacturing innovations. However, additive manufactured components are thus far untested in high radiation environments and potentially pose a risk until validated. Mainstream\u2019s technology represents a disruptive technology to the learning curve of traditional and additive manufacturing. Applied to steel components of the SMR, Mainstream has the potential to realize the reduced costs and deployment schedules predicted for SMRs through additive manufacturing. Mainstream will produce steel components for the SMR and other industries through its high energy processing technology while demonstrating the radiation tolerance of additive manufacturing. In Phase II, we will additively manufacture prototype SMR components and demonstrate their consistency. We will study the strength of the additively manufactured material and its neutron radiation tolerance of additive manufactured components compared to traditional manufacturing. We will conclude Phase II with the delivery of prototype SMR components.Commercial Applications and Other BenefitsThe use of additive manufacturing is expected to dramatically reduce the costs and lead times of SMR components. Additive manufacturing is predicted to reduce the deployment times and SMR costs by up to 6 months and 20%, respectively. Additive manufacturing produces parts rapidly, with fewer raw materials, and with less waste compared to traditional machining. Components no longer in production can be produced on-demand leading to implementation of \u201cjust-in-time\u201d manufacturing."

        "abstract": "Access to the earth\u2019s subsurface requires technologies that can operate at extremely high temperatures and pressures. Enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) require drilling deep and hot wells; while making better use of each well through techniques such as fracking and zonal isolation. Establishing a well requires monitoring electronics that can produce temperature, pressure and flow profiles in these deep (10,000+ feet) wells that can experience temperatures as high as 450\u00b0C. Present-day electronic systems only last 4-6 hours in this environment, and even fiber optic systems (that only monitor temperature) cannot survive for the 30 days above the 200\u00b0C experienced in the establishment of a well. Ozark IC is a leader in the development of integrated Silicon Carbide (SiC) circuits and is actively developing circuits for NASA, suitable for operation on the surface of Venus \u2013 with temperatures up to 500oC and pressures up to 100 bar nominal \u2013 not unlike subterranean conditions on earth. Ozark IC\u2019s partner, Honeybee Robotics (HBR), has developed advanced motors that can operate in this environment. In Phase I, Ozark IC and HBR demonstrated, using environmental laboratory testing, that these technologies can be combined to create next-generation down hole instruments with self-powered capability. By using SiC technology, instruments can withstand 1,000s of hours in these conditions. The thrust of Phase II is a flow, temperature and pressure system that will not only meet EGS needs up to 500oC but is also designed to be networkable through the use of SiC electronic \u201csmart nodes\u201d. The prototype electronic sensor nodes will be designed to work in this subterranean environment (up to 500\u00b0C, 150 bar) for no less than 300 hours. Each smart node contains a data acquisition module that contains a sensor and SiC integrated circuits that digitize the sensor data and communicate it to the surface. Modules can be configured to measure temperature, pressure and\/or flow, all placed on a high-temperature ceramic platform. Honeybee Robotics will fabricate a turbine and generator which will be used for both power generation and flow sensing.Commercial Applications and Other BenefitsIn addition to its application in enhanced geothermal wells, the anticipated public benefits of the proposed research begin with enabling next generation oil and gas exploration and well monitoring. The technology can also be applied to aerospace applications to enable higher performance turbine engines and may ultimately be applied to automotive applications to improve the control and efficiency of internal combustion engines."

        "abstract": "Utilization of waste carbon dioxide from industrial sources could (1) provide an additional income stream for CO2 emitting industries and (2) provide a distributed and domestic source of carbon-based compounds for use as chemicals and fuels. An efficient, cost-effective, and modular reactor for electrochemical reduction of CO2 (ECO2R) to carbon-neutral or \u2013negative compounds is needed to make this a reality. Compounds produced though ECO2R can be used as feedstocks into biological processes to produce higher value materials. Using only water and electricity as inputs, ECO2R has been demonstrated to produce over 16 different fuels and chemicals. This Phase II grant will develop and scale up an electrochemical process to convert CO2 and water into syngas for use as a feedstock for gas fermentation to make bioproducts. This breakthrough process uses a polymer-electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolyzer design. PEM water electrolyzers are used commercially for hydrogen generation and with modifications, the same commercially viable design can be used for CO2 electrolysis. This repurposing of water electrolyzers will be achieved with the support of a world-leader in PEM water electrolysis for hydrogen generation with the capacity to manufacture electrolyzers on the MW-scale. This use of an existing electrolyzer architecture that has undergone years of optimization to increase efficiency and bring down cost provides a clear path to reach market scale. Phase I demonstrated that high CO2 utilization is feasible in a novel PEM CO2 electrolyzer by modifying the CO2 flow rate, cell compression, gas diffusion layer type, and flow field pattern. Increased CO2 utilization resulted in high syngas (H2+CO) product concentrations that can be fed directly into a fermentation reactor without the need for further product concentration or purification. Avoiding this extra purification step is a significant cost savings when coupling the ECO2R process to a bioreactor. In addition, this proposal will also demonstrate that waste CO2 emissions are a suitable reactant for ECO2R electrolyzer and the resulting product syngas can be used as a feedstock for gas fermentation. An ethanol producer will provide waste CO2 emissions for conversion to syngas within an ECO2R reactor. This syngas will then be used by a leading bioproducts company in their gas fermentation process to make ethanol, which can be further reacted to make renewable jet fuel if desired. Through a Phase II award, it will be demonstrated that waste CO2 emissions can be used to make bioproducts by coupling the ECO2R syngas generation process to gas fermentation and that ECO2R electrolyzers can scale up to the tons\/day scale needed to manufacture bioproducts."

        "abstract": "The need for Radiation Therapy (RT) for cancer treatment is dramatically underserved in less developed parts both because of the high cost of RT systems and that such systems need reliable utilities. The company plans to use novel technology recently developed to manufacture and market the next generation of RT systems offering both greatly enhanced capabilities and more cost-effective patient treatment. The underlying accelerator technology can be utilized to make low-cost, environmentally insensitive RT systems for underserved markets. The benefits to the DOE and to the public are improved medical systems, and the potential for new low-cost accelerator-based X-ray sources to replace ones using radioactive isotopes. A recent breakthrough in RF linac cell design and topologies has led to extremely efficient structures in terms of RF to beam efficiency. This topology results in a significant reduction in parts count and manufacturing cost. This structure technology will be combined with a low voltage electron gun, beam buncher and x-ray target to form the basis of the low cost medical accelerator proposed in this SBIR. Intrinsically, because of low RF power and cooling requirements, the system is suitable for markets with unreliable utilities. The proposed accelerator including a novel high efficiency buncher was designed and calculations to optimize the x-ray production were performed. In addition, a path to a battery-backed RF power source was laid out. Speed-of-light sections have already been built and tested with performance verify against simulations. In Year 1, the full accelerator will be built and demonstrated with RF. In Year 2, the battery-backed RF source will be built and commissioned with the accelerator to generate beam. Stand-alone operation of the system will be demonstrated.Commercial Applications and Other Benefits\nThe proposed accelerators offer cost reductions in existing accelerator-based x-ray sources that are used for imaging, medical, security and industrial applications. This will boost sales of RT systems over current forecasts, by expanding deployment in underserved markets in low-middle income countries (LMIC) which will account for up to 70% of the world-wide cancer incidence. In addition, our design can be easily adapted for use as replacements for radiological x-rays sources avoiding risk of the latter\u2019s potential misuse in a radiological dispersion device, often termed a \u2018dirty bomb\u2019. Because of its efficiency and compactness, it can offer an attractive alternative for betatron-based mobile imaging systems."

        "abstract": "Conventional lithium-ion batteries demonstrate great potential for applications in electrical vehicles, but they face some major challenges such as low energy density and high cost. It is worthwhile to pursue alternative strategies to address the barriers of cost and energy density. We propose to develop advanced rechargeable lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries that have much higher theoretical energy density and lower cost. We will improve the practicality and cycle life of Li-S batteries to make them more commercially viable. In the Phase I project, we have improved the energy density and cycle life of Li-S batteries using button cells. First, highly conductive lithium-ion exchange (LIE) films have been used as battery separators. Second, concentrated Li electrolytes has been applied to the sulfur electrodes. These efforts have prevented cathode sulfur loss due to the polysulfide diffusion, thus significantly enhancing the cycle life of Li-S batteries. In the Phase II project, we will further develop this technology using more advanced and low-cost lithium-ion exchange (LIE) separators and ionomers to further reduce polysulfide diffusion. We will then increase the S loading, fabricate pouch cells and evaluate their energy density and cycle life under more realistic EV conditionsCommercial Applications and Other Benefits\nThe proposed lithium-sulfur technology will address two major barriers of electrical vehicles, cost and energy density; therefore it may directly facilitate the deployment and commercialization of electrical vehicles. They may also be applicable in the consumer market to portable electronics and communication devices."

        "abstract": "Microwave isolators are highly desired for high-power RF (radio-frequency) systems that drive linear accelerators. Reflected power from the accelerator can destabilize the RF system and reduce the life of the RF source requiring expensive replacement. The available isolators are costly and have limited reliability and power-handling capabilities. High power isolators are also of interest to DOE laboratories with high energy accelerators and in these systems the power is so high, there is no viable device that can be used. The company proposes a new class of isolators scalable, in principle, to extremely high-power levels. These novel devices are compact and promise low cost in production. These devices are based on a recent invention of a new microwave device called the \u201cpolarizer\u201d. The topology of the polarizer allows for the synthesis of a scalable modular structure for arbitrary power levels. This project will design and manufacture prototypes of the isolators at the three frequencies most commonly used in industry and national laboratories. The isolators will be tested at high-power facilities at national labs, universities and industry. A test isolator microwave structure at X-band was designed and constructed with the ability to use different garnet materials. It was placed inside an electromagnet to characterize the garnet materials. The device properties were tested and the results were compared to the theoretical prediction and simulations. In the actual isolator the appropriate magnetic field will be provide using permanent magnet material and a design for this magnet has been made. A compact, dry, high-power RF load was designed to be integrated with the isolator. In Year 1, prototypes of isolators and associated RF loads at different frequencies will be built and tested with high power RF. In Year 2, lessons learned from these prototypes will be used to design, build and commission production versions of isolators\/loads at S-band, X-band and Ku-band.Commercial Applications and Other Benefits\nAll medical linacs and linac-based security systems use RF isolators and the market is large, e.g. Varian alone manufactures 500 such systems a year. The proposed isolator will be more reliable, capable of handling much higher powers and more cost-effective. Reducing the overall manufacturing and operational costs of linacs for medical, industrial and security applications and improving their reliability is key to more widespread applications of such systems. Isolators capable of 10\u2019s of MW power handling capability which can be used in HEP accelerators can be similarly designed."
