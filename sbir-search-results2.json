        "abstract": "The recent events at the Fukushima nuclear power plant highlight the need for enhanced accident tolerance. Of particular concern is the overheating of standard zirconium alloy cladding in a loss of coolant accident (LOCA). One of the leading candidates for future claddings is a silicon carbide (SiC) composite. However, it is clear that due to the inherent brittle nature of ceramics and the intrinsic porosity of composites, the retention of fission products within a SiC-based cladding is an issue. Some SiC clad designs seek to overcome this issue through one or more ceramic coatings such as CVD SiC. However, the community has recently raised concerns regarding hydrothermal corrosion of SiC. Both fission product retention as-compromised by thermomechanical loading or irradiation, or corrosion leading to an unacceptable level of silica in the reactor coolant, suggest the need for an alternative concept to the fullyceramic SiC\/SiC clad. One such design is the hybrid design, using a thin metallic coating on the exterior of the composite. In theory, this coating could provide fission product retention under normal operating conditions and the required environmental barrier coating (EBC) against corrosion. During this investigation, an innovative coating technique has been developed for producing the corrosion resistant metallic EBC, i.e., Vacuum Plasma Spray \u2013 Thin Film (VPS- F). The VPS-TF process enables the production of dense, thin film coatings at lower pressures with higher plasma power than conventional VPS processing. As a result, the feedstock material is evaporated or partially evaporated resulting in a very fine coating microstructure of splats and columnar growth, which possess improved strain tolerance similar to physical vapor deposition (PVD). However, unlike PVD, VPS-TF has relatively high deposition rate and the ability to economically coat large SiC\/SiC on a production basis. Using these techniques, corrosion resistant metallic coatings such as FeCrAl, 310SS, and Cr, were successfully deposited on SiC\/SiC tubes during Phase I. Preliminary analysis and testing of these coatings at MIT have produced very encouraging results including improved hydrothermal corrosion resistance as compared to uncoated SiC\/SiC. During Phase II, fabrication techniques will be optimized. Prototypical fuel rods with the improved cladding will be fabricated and tested at relevant reactor conditions.Commercial Applications and Other Benefits\nFuel rods for safe commercial nuclear power in USA and throughout the world. A significant secondary benefit is that the primary manufacturing process being developed under this work, the VPS-TF, is likely to find application is a wide array of other applications such as EBCs for turbines or similar thermal protective applications."

        "abstract": "Ineffective fracture design and practices in unconventional oil and natural gas wells present environmental risks and reduce the production efficiency of hydraulic fracturing, largely due to the inability to measure propped fracture geometry and behavior using current proppants and available tools. In this project, a unique proppant detection technology based on acoustic metamaterials is being developed that allows distinct detection of proppant location and environmental conditions away from the wellbore using industry standard acoustic logging tools. Development of the smart proppant and related detection technology is accomplished through design and scaled-up production of metamaterial proppant particles, proppant characterization including effects of mechanical stress on acoustic response, pilot deployment of downhole acoustic logging tool to detect proppant geometry and behavior, and development of advanced data analysis techniques to locate proppant in fractures away from the wellbore. In Phase I, a composite particle structure with specific geometries and mechanical properties was designed based on acoustic modeling and simulation and a production system was engineered to produce the smart proppant. Laboratory acoustic testing using ultrasonic transducers was employed to test control and experimental proppants in various environmental and geometric configurations. Mixtures of control and experimental proppants were used to determine the concentration dependence of the acoustic response. Mechanical load was applied to the proppants and mixtures during acoustic testing and the change in response under stress was measured. A pilot field trial was conducted in which proppant packets were buried around a cemented casing pipe and the simulated wellbore was logged using a monopole, full waveform triple sonic logging tool. In Phase II, an improved smart proppant with smaller size and acoustic signatures in the middle of the frequency range of a monopole sonic logging tool will be produced in scaled-up quantity, characterized, and tested in a pilot field study. This effort will greatly expand the understanding and utility of the smart proppant and related detection systems by improving discrimination and contrast of proppant position and determination of closure stress at the proppant location. Alternative acoustic detection methods will be explored along with advanced data analysis techniques for determining the character of propped fractures. Increased information about hydraulic fracturing operations directly benefits environmental health and safety. It can lead to increased stimulation efficiency, zonal isolation, and production control. Knowledge of proppant distribution and flowback helps to better understand the geomechanical forces and operational requirements of hydraulic fracturing. The ultimate result of this enhanced awareness is safer and more economical production techniques and processes that contribute to US energy independence."

        "abstract": "Cellulose nanofibrils represent a natural, sustainable source of nanofibers that can be used as reinforcing additives. Unfortunately, the hydrophilic surface properties of the cellulose nanofibrils make it difficult for them to be incorporated into hydrophobic polymer matrices of common manufacturing plastics to form fiber reinforced composites. TDA is developing technology that can be used to modify the surfaces of cellulose nanofibrils so that they become compatible with today\u2019s bulk industrial polymers. Cellulose nanofibril materials that can be routinely and efficiently incorporated into manufacturing polymers could result in a new family of natural fiber-based composites for manufacturing applications that use a renewable, sustainable source of raw materials. In Phase I, TDA developed chemistry to modify cellulose nanofibrils to allow them to be readily incorporated into plastics. We produced modified cellulose nanofibril reinforced composites that could be used to manufacture composite materials for automobiles. The composites were characterized and showed improved mechanical properties when surface modified cellulose nanofibrils were used as fiber reinforcing fillers. In Phase II, TDA will expand its development of surface modified cellulose nanofibrils to produce renewable fibers for a variety of polymers used in the automotive manufacturing industry. Polymer composites using these new cellulose materials will be fabricated, tested, and optimized for increased mechanical properties. Finally, the production of surface modified cellulose nanofibrils will be scale-up to a production quantity of 1 kilogram per batch.Commercial Applications and Other Benefits\nTDA will prepare cellulose fiber composites that can be used in applications that currently use glass or carbon fiber composites, such as automotive components or clean energy components. TDA\u2019s composites will use a green, sustainable fiber source, use less energy to produce, be recyclable, and will be price competitive with current fiber reinforced composites."

        "abstract": "A recent experiment at the DIII-D tokamak has pioneered an innovative and potentially critical actuator for burning plasmas: helicon wave current drive. Steady-state profile maintenance in future burning plasma experiments will require efficient and economically viable sources of off-axis current drive. Promising indications that helicon current drive can fill this need led to the establishment of a DIII-D research-line focused on exploration of helicon current drive physics, and a low-power prototype helicon antenna was installed in DIII-D and operated. The development of a more detailed theoretical understanding of this current drive source antenna, and its complicated interaction with, and coupling to, the scrape-off layer plasma is the primary research goal of this project. The project will utilize the time-domain cold plasma modeling capability developed in a DOE sponsored SciDAC project to model the coupling of power to the plasma. 3D geometric modeling at this detail level has not yet been performed on a helicon antenna-plasma system before in this frequency range. The Phase I project demonstrated the ability to model the DIII-D Low Power Antenna loaded into a resistive sheet, and also into plasma, and benchmarked simulations of it to experimental test-bed measurements of loading vs frequency and distance to the resistive sheet. Simulations of a 36 module High Power Antenna configuration on a NERSC supercomputer also show feasibility to handle a problem this large. The Phase II project will focus efforts in three areas: a) modeling and analysis of the helicon antennas and experiments performed and being planned for the DIII-D tokamak, b) improvements to the software to address issues brought to light in the Phase I effort, and c) integration of the modeling capability into a robust user friendly commercial package. The primary research challenge will be modeling of the High Power Antenna array, which has a linear dimension of a couple meters, and yet requires 1 mm scale resolution, such that the modeling effort requires software that can operate effectively at super-computer scale.Commercial Applications and Other BenefitsThe ability to model antenna coupling to plasma in a user friendly (GUI-driven) time-domain software package would be a unique feature of the commercial software. Such capability would be of great interest in the design and analysis of a wide range of helicon and industrial plasmas heated by RF antennas."

        "abstract": "Significant amounts of time and resources are spent generating and maintaining meshes for modeling and simulation by engineers and scientists in industry, government, and academia. Beyond mesh generation, one major problem complex multiphysics software, such as those used in nuclear energy software, currently faces is the complex transfer of quantities between meshes during high-performance simulations. The proposed work seeks to produce a set of general- purpose methodologies for automated mesh generation, re_nement, and solution veri_cation that will be universally applicable to all kinds of multiphysics simulation, with speci_c relevance for nuclear engineering applications.An open-source, web-enabled, modular, and extensible platform for mesh generation and solution transfer for complex reactor geometries is currently being built from custom and open-source tools. In this project, the software product will be extended to perform automated solution veri_cation and adaptive mesh re_nement. A software platform for mesh-related services was extended, and additional features for autonomous solution veri_cation and adaptive re_nement was designed and implemented. The software was initially tested for multiphysics modeling and simulation applications. The feasibility of the design and initial implementation was demonstrated for simple Multiphysics applications. The software platform will be substantially extended and new features will be added to support demonstrated services in more complex cases. The software will be com- prehensively tested and debugged in-house and on customer sites. Additional capabilities will be implemented to facilitate user interaction and ease-of-use.Commercial Applications and Other Benefits\nHistorically, signi_cant resources and up to\n80% of total analysis time is spent generating meshes\/grids for multiphysics simulations. Engineers, scientists, and educators, especially those in the commercial sector or at small academic institutions, need an integrated, intuitive, and easy to use application that can reduce the burden of mesh generation. The proposed innovation delivers enhanced access to customized solutions to novice and expert users alike who rely on simulation in their research and development environments.

        "abstract": "OLED lighting panels have been available commercially for several years, with relatively slow adoption into commercial and consumer fixtures in the US. This project addresses both channels through the commercialization of an ultra-thin, bendable, high-efficacy OLED light engine in which a panel and driver are engineered together in one low-cost, easy-to-use package. The most significant benefit of OLED lighting to the US could be economic. Today there are only two significant OLED lighting panel manufacturers in the world, OLEDWorks LLC (OLEDWorks) and LG Display. OLEDWorks manufactures the highest brightness, longest lifetime, most efficient, highest quality OLED lighting panels in the world. Its current commercially available rigid OLED light engines (Keuka module) were designed and developed and are assembled at its headquarters in Rochester, New York. Many of the world leading OLED lighting luminaire manufacturers are also located in the US and work closely with OLEDWorks. From this position of strength, the US has the opportunity to maintain a technological advantage that can grow both US manufacturing jobs and export sales. The Phase I project developed a high efficacy, bendable OLED lighting panel, and based on this panel we designed, engineered, and prototyped a thin, curved, high efficacy OLED light engine that demonstrated the proof of concept. The high efficacy, bendable OLED panel developed for use in the light engine included formulation changes to the OLED organic layers and introduction of a highly reflective silver cathode as well as development of new technologies for encapsulation of the panel and for making electrical contact between conductive areas on the panel substrate and the driver PCB. This Phase II will continue the improvements made in Phase I including OLED formulation, and bendable substrates. The efficacy of the OLED panel will be increased from 60 lm\/W to 90 lm\/W through addition of internal light extraction. We will also address manufacturability and scalability of light engine parts. If all of the improvements in this Phase II proposal can be accomplished, the size of the lighting market that will be available to OLED lighting luminaire manufacturers will drastically increase beyond the high-end niche market of today into the main stream commercial and consumer markets, there-by achieving the promise predicted by the DOE for a mixture of LED and OLED solid state lighting that will significantly reduce energy consumption for lighting while simultaneously improving the social and public benefits of solid state lighting and the economic opportunities for US lighting manufacturers."

        "abstract": "A new diagnostic is currently being developed by Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) which will be able to provide direct measurements for the energy and density of \u201crunaway\u201d electrons in tokamak fusion reactors with unprecedented resolution. The multi-MeV, runaways pose a serious risk to tokamak reactors; capable of inflicting catastrophic damage to the armor and vessel walls. A proper diagnosis of the runaway electrons is critical to mitigating their formation. The diagnostic, dubbed Laser Inverse Compton Scattering (LICS), works in a way that is similar to conventional Thomson scattering. However, the scattered laser photons are upshifted in frequency to the range of soft to hard x-rays. The diagnostic leverages an 80 ps, gated x-ray framing camera developed at LANL for the Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF) program to detect the scattered x-rays and minimize the amount of accumulated noise via the short exposure. The other requirement for the success of the LICS diagnostic is a laser source which can produce more than 1 Joule of photons inside the 80 ps gate, and in order to obtain a time history of the runaways, a modest pulse repetition rate is required.Voss Scientific has made considerable advances in laser technology, having demonstrated an innovative 200 mJ, 80 ps laser at 1.064 microns with a repetition rate of 1 kHz (developed under a prior Phase II SBIR with the Navy). In order to meet the requirements for a functional LICS diagnostic, we propose the development of a Joule-per-pulse laser system which will produce 80 ps pulses with a repetition frequency of 200 Hz. The laser will be compact and \u201cturn-key\u201d operable; appropriate for use in a typical tokamak laboratory. The LANL framing camera, as it exists today, only supports frame rates on the order of 10\u2019s of Hz, but upgrades to higher frame rates are not beyond current technology. The innovative, Joule-class laser, once it is demonstrated, will have exceeded currently available commercial systems by more than a factor of 10 with respects to peak pulse power and repetition rate. During the Phase I project, testing and calculations were performed to verify that the proposed system will meet the specified requirements for LICS and operate safely at the edge of the absolute limits of the materials involved in the light amplification. The laser has many potential applications beyond the LICS diagnostic, including, but not limited to, functioning as a pump laser for an ultra-short pulse laser (USPL) system. Particularly an USPL enabled by the proposed system could produce multi-terawatt pulses with a high average power. Applications like isotope production via laser based accelerators, neutron imaging, and proton beam cancer therapy have all shown promise in research settings with low rep-rate, terawatt pulses, but they all fall short in dose rates due to the lack of a high repetition rate system like the proposed laser. In this respect, the laser could be potentially revolutionary in these commercial areas."

        "abstract": "Two-thirds of all electric outage minutes are weather-related, mostly the result of damage to above ground distribution lines. These outages cost the U.S. economy between $18 and $33 billion per year. We propose to rapidly assess line damage immediately following an extreme weather event using specially equipped unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).\nEfforts to restore power start with the utility\u2019s spotters driving through flooded, blocked and unlit roads to document the extent of storm damage to distribution lines. In order to assess the inaccessible spans, the spotter can launch an autonomous UAV from their vehicle that will use stereoscopic 3D depth perception to sense and avoid obstacles as it maintains a fixed distance from the overhead lines, collecting images as it travels. Onboard algorithms will send a curated set of geo-tagged imagery to the spotter and the Incident Command Center. Other first responders will also be alerted to unsafe conditions such as downed wires and flooding. In Phase I, with the assistance of a major utility partner, we developed and field-tested pattern recognition algorithms to detect poles and wires. We flagged anomalies such as missing lines, downed poles and encroaching vegetation. We also developed an app to present this information to the spotter. In Phase II, we will detect more elements of interest, such as damaged insulators, broken cross arms and blown fuses. We will also deploy our technology on an autonomous UAV that can populate the utility\u2019s asset management system with time-stamped aerial images of the damage and repairs. Ultimately, we will reduce outage minutes by helping utilities to prioritize work orders and deploy suitably equipped restoration crews."

        "abstract": "Combinatorial material science takes advantage of technologies that make it possible to prepare a large number of material compositions in a single process, along with efficient assaying and sorting methods, to create and identify new desirable material compositions. Past and current efforts using combinatorial material science to create new alloy compositions have only explored a very limited design space due to lack of suitable material alloying technologies. The proposed project explores the use of powder-based electron beam additive manufacturing (EBAM) as a combinatorial method to design and optimize metallic alloys and heterogeneous structures. In particular, in Phase II we will optimize and implement a multi-material powder deposition system for use in a novel EBAM platform allowing he creation of customizable alloy spanning the full range of alloy compositions. In the course of the associated Phase I RadiaBeam has developed a conceptual design for a selective, multi-material powder deposition system suitable for implementation in electron-beam based additive manufacturing platforms. RadiaBeam has also successfully attracted funding, and entered into a joint venture with a commercial maker of EBAM systems to develop and commercialize the proposed technology. In Phase II we propose to optimize, fabricate and integrate the multi-material deposition capability, allowing engineered graded material joints, in the EBAM platform, and validate its performance.Commercial Applications and Other Benefits\nUpon development, the proposed multi-material electron beam-based additive manufacturing system can be licensed to aerospace, defense, and OEM AM manufactures. RadiaBeam has already obtained funding from an EBAM system manufacturer, and entered into a joint venture to develop a commercial multimaterial EBAM system."

        "abstract": "Electronic geophones currently used in the oil and gas industry cannot meet the ever-more demanding requirements for robust, high-temperature capabilities and abilities to record the broad-band seismic data needed for high-resolution imaging. Electronic geophones are not capable of recording the low-magnitude and high-frequency signals that are being produced by hydraulic fracturing, water and CO2 injection and oil and gas production processes. The electronic systems deployed today are also effectively small-aperture low-fidelity antennas which limits the accuracy of the location of the mapped events. The industry needs capabilities to deploy sensors at higher pressures and temperatures in vertical and horizontal boreholes and to record low-magnitude and high-frequency seismic events in high-fidelity. Fiber-optic based point vector sensors have been shown to overcome most of the shortcomings found in the legacy electronic sensors. The fiber sensors themselves are not as mechanically complex as their electric counterpart making them more robust and suitable to be long-term deployed in hostile environments. However, optical interrogators are today not commercially available and they are not easy to design. Effective optical vector sensing requires an advanced optical interrogator that can operate in a controlled field environment at the earth surface. A prototype fiber optic interferometric interrogator was designed, prototyped and successfully tested recording high-quality seismic optical vector sensor data. A fiber-optic interrogator capable of monitoring 300 optical sensors simultaneously while supporting the industry standard seismic interfaces will be designed, built, laboratory tested and field deployed. The interrogator will support interferometric fiber-optic sensors using an active modulation process. The interrogator will be tested and verified against current interrogator technologies at our facilities. A low-noise, push-pull Michelson interferometer or Mach-Zehnder sensor will also be constructed to test the noise capabilities of the newly developed interrogator. At first, the interrogator will be used in a laboratory setting while recording low-amplitude high-frequency data to validate and optimize the design. Next, the results from that process will be used to develop, build and test an operational commercial unit for the Fiber Optic Seismic Vector Sensor (FOSVS) arrays developed by Paulsson, Inc.Commercial Applications and Other Benefits\nThere are almost 100,000 wells in the United States that have already been hydraulically fractured with a significant fracturing backlog of already drilled wells. When cost effective solutions are available for high-resolution and continuous monitoring, hydraulic fracturing will be monitored for financial, environmental and legal compliance reasons. The proposed low-noise interrogator system will provide the technically and cost-effectively means to monitor and map hydro fracture and production operations in real time. Fiber-optic sensors are also well suited for geothermal applications since they can tolerate temperatures over 300\u00b0C. Fiber-optic arrays will also be used to monitor CO2 injection for sequestration and production enhancements."

        "abstract": "Innovative fabrication technologies for cost-effective high-Q, high-field superconducting radio frequency (SRF) components are needed for the economic viability of future accelerator facilities. The worldwide particle accelerator community continues to investigate alternatives and performance-enhancing modifications to bulk niobium accelerator components via the application of superconducting films. DOE is interested in development of advanced process technologies to deposit superconducting materials such as triniobium-tin (Nb3Sn), which has the potential to exceed the performance capabilities of bulk niobium when formed on the interior surface of existing bulk niobium, or less costly copper, accelerator component structures, enabling substantial fabrication and operating costreductions for continuous wave and high gradient accelerators. Ultramet, in collaboration with Cornell University\u2019s SRF Group, with support from the Applied Superconductivity Center at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory at Florida State University (FSU), and building on previous work by Cornell, CERN, JLAB, and others, is developing techniques to create well-bonded layers of triniobium-tin on copper, niobium, and molybdenum substrates via Ultramet\u2019s advanced chemical vapor deposition processing technologies. Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) thin film process technology using prealloyed niobium-tin precursor materials was developed and demonstrated to form triniobium-tin layers on flat molybdenum, copper, and niobium substrates as a critical first step in developing CVD processes for Nb3Sn with a tin content of 24% for accelerator component applications. Material characterization including surface resistance and RF performance properties were measured and results related to prior research. Process variables deemed critical for material optimization, future process scaling, and accelerator cavity and component fabrication efforts in Phase II were identified. Ultramet will team with Cornell and Niowave, and obtain Nb-Sn CVD precursors to be developed by Nb3Sn experts at Florida State, to fabricate and characterize multiple copper single-cell 1.3-GHz SRF test cavities of the ILCdesign utilizing the newly developed CVD Nb3Sn process. The CVD Nb3Sn on copper fabrication methodology will be scaled to produce testable flanged Nb3Sn-lined copper cavities. Extensive cavity characterization including temperature mapping, post-test dissection, and surface material analysis will be performed by Cornell. Ultramet will generate cost estimates for 1.3-GHz CVD Nb3Sn-lined copper ILC single-cell cavity fabrication as a cost indicator for complete 9-cell ILC cavities. Commercial applications and other benefits: Ultramet\u2019s CVD-based processing to be developed in this project will represent a significant technical milestone in the cavity surface application of the superconducting material Nb3Sn. The critical temperature of Nb3Sn is 18 K versus 9.2 K for niobium, making Nb3Sn far more efficient and allowing for higher temperature operation of SRF components, avoiding the need for expensive and complex superfluid\/subatmospheric helium operation to enable substantial cost reductions for SRF programs worldwide."

        "abstract": "Application of nuclear fusion for cost-competitive energy generation cannot be realized until advanced plasma- facing materials and structures are developed. The specific problem addressed in this project is the mitigation of heat-induced failure, surface erosion, and surface blistering of tungsten-based plasma-facing components as a result of the interaction of tungsten with energetic helium and hydrogen isotopes. Ultramet, teaming with Digital Materials Solutions (DMS), the University of California-San Diego (UCSD), and the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), as well as EUROfusion, is developing and demonstrating microengineered textured plasma-facing armor for tungsten-based components that is highly tolerant of thermomechanical stress relative to conventional smooth tungsten, and that can efficiently release implanted helium and deuterium ions without blistering. Specifically, structural open-cell tungsten foam (several mm thick) is diffusion-bonded to the divertor surface, followed by vapor deposition of a high surface area textured tungsten coating throughout the foam ligament structure to volumetrically distribute incident radiation. The performance of Ultramet\u2019s textured tungsten foam armor was evaluated through helium plasma testing at the UCSD PISCES facility and through modeling at DMS. Modeling and confirmatory test results showed that textured foam can withstand substantially greater helium fluence levels with reduced damage and possesses greater thermal stress resistance compared with smooth tungsten. The growth rate of tungsten \u201cfuzz\u201d was shown to be substantially lower, while the net sputtering erosion was drastically reduced by a factor of 7. Following continued optimization, it is anticipated that a divertor armor can be developed to substantially increase component lifetime. Textured tungsten foam armor optimization will include fabrication and evaluation of several variants of foam pore size, total porosity, and texture, as well as bonding of the armor to tungsten and heat sink materials. Multiscale\/multiphysics modeling of plasma damage and thermomechanical response will be performed by DMS. Performance testing will include multiple iterations of helium plasma exposure testing in the PISCES divertor plasma simulator at UCSD to evaluate armor surface erosion in a fusion plasma-relevant environment. Development specimens and a prototypical divertor submodule will be fabricated and tested in the UCLA HEFTY facility to determine thermostructural operational limits including the maximum heat flux capability. Development specimens will also be provided to EUROfusion which has expressed significant interest in this work and offered to perform high heat flux testing at no cost. Commercial applications and other benefits: With its low generation of radioactive waste, thermonuclear fusion is ideal for large-scale energy generation. Efforts are already in place to complete construction of the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) with heavy U.S. participation. Practical demonstration of fusion technology is being pursued in the DEMO (European- led) and FNSF (U.S.-led) studies, and the development of advanced materials that can tolerate extreme plasma- generated heat flux is essential to their success. The proposed advanced materials development will also find application in spacecraft electric propulsion systems. Fast-startup, high-current cathode technology utilizing textured foams and coatings has the potential to provide more than an order of magnitude improvement in cathode lifetime and startup time for high-power, high-efficiency electric propulsion."

        "abstract": "Nano materials have a wide range of applications, ranging from drug delivery in medical applications to new composite materials in aerospace applications. Experimental data on nanoparticle growth exists, but numerical simulations are needed to understand the underlying physical mechanisms and to enable better prediction of nanomaterial production. The numerical models of plasma assisted production span from detailed atomistic models including interaction of individual atoms to fluid models coupled with Maxwell equations that determine plasma composition and kinetic models describing the nanoparticle growth. How- ever, existing models are either computationally extremely expensive as in the case of atomistic models or don\u2019t include kinetic effects that are important for the nanoparticles production. We propose to use Particle-In-Cell (PIC) methods to simulate growth rates of nanotubes. Because PIC is less computationally expensive than atomistic simulations and can still capture kinetic effects that fluid simulations cannot, it is able to address this important issue in a unique way. In addition, PIC predictions can be fed to existing plasma fluid codes for more accurate production modeling. We will extend an existing commercially available Particle-In-Cell software package for plasma physics sim- ulations to include models that can be used to predict the growth rates of nanoparticles. The predicted growth rates can be used to better understand the physics of nanoparticle production and its optimization. We developed and implemented prototype surface kinetic chemistry models for non-uniform particle fluxes in Vorpal, the computational engine of commercial Particle-In-Cell software VSim. We also extended the geometric and meshing capabilities of Vorpal, by developing new prototype algorithms that take into account changes in nanotube geometry due to its growth. During Phase I we also examined the importance of stream boundary conditions for nanoparticles growth simulation in plasma environment. In Phase II we will extend meshing capabilities of Vorpal computational engine by extending a cut-cell algorithm to non-uniform orthogonal meshes. We will also improve and speed up electrostatic solvers in the Vorpal computational engine. In addition, we will expand surface process models used by the PIC method in the Vorpal computational engine. Commercial applications and other benefits: Simulation of advanced materials for organic photovoltaics, batteries, thermoelectrics, advanced coatings, and pharmaceuticals will speed development of these and other novel products and will help US indus- tries compete and be more efficient. The usage of the PIC method will enhance numerical simulations of nanoparticle production in non-equilibrium conditions beyond what is possible with existing approaches."

        "abstract": "Superconducting transition edge sensors are a key technology for measuring the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation leftover from the early universe. To reach the large number of sensors (~400,000-500,000) needed for next generation experiments, solutions must be found to reduce time, weight, size, and cost of the sensor arrays. This project addresses these issues by both integrating the sensors with peripheral circuitry to reduce the overall size, and also by exploiting the increased production volume and reliability of a commercial foundry for detector fabrication. In Phase 1, superconducting resonators that enable the readout of several detectors on a single measurement channel were successful fabricated on the same wafers as the detectors, thus eliminating the need for external multiplexing circuitry. In addition, nearly all detector fabrication steps were successfully carried out at the commercial foundry. In Phase II, the remaining fabrication steps will be brought to the commercial foundry so that there is a complete commercial end-to-end process. Production will be improved iteratively over the Phase II period to maximize detector performance, yield, and production volume. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: This work will result in a commercial source of superconducting sensor arrays for the government, academic, and industrial sectors. The specific sensors being developed have application in Cosmic Microwave Background and light dark matter experiments. The integrated resonator technology is useful for multiplexed readout and control of sensors as well as other array based elements, such as qubits for quantum information processing."

        "abstract": "Power outages from natural disasters not only result in billions of dollars of losses, associated health and safety impacts can result in significant loss of life. After a disaster, damage assessments of electrical grid infrastructure are critical for developing a strategy for power restoration including the optimal allocation of resources. Despite improvements, the damage assessment process is still a slow, manual process, which impacts the speed of recovery. In the Phase I effort, Oceanit developed and demonstrated an automated assessment system with real- time on board image processing to identify damaged grid infrastructure from a drone. Oceanit\u2019s ePoP technology would be used to provide wireless communications and power and Oceanit\u2019s MERCI technology brings command and control capabilities. In the Phase I effort, Oceanit used its VIPA (Versatile Image Processing Architecture) machine vision technology to identify grid infrastructure and commercial off-the-shelf machine learning frameworks to categorize damage real-time. Oceanit\u2019s MERCI (Mobile Emergency Response and Command Interface) software was customized to interface with the machine learning framework so that damage assessment data would be consolidated in a single data source for actionable intelligence. Oceanit\u2019s ePoP, pop up power and communications system was configured with an external gateway so that a satellite Internet device could be used so the system could send damage information to a centralized Emergency Operations Center (EOC) even if there is no power or cellular communications in the field. For the Phase II effort, the object identification and object classification algorithms will be optimized and integrated into the MERCI and ePoP system, which will be packaged into a field deployable system that we are calling MERCI-UI (Utility Inspections). MERCI-UI will be tested and evaluated by strategic partners as pricing and go-to-market strategies developed for targeted markets. The effort will also focus on industry engagement opportunities including events and demonstrations to position MERCI-UI for commercialization. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: In addition to improving the damage assessment process for utility inspections, MERCI-UI could be used for day to day inspections as well as inspections in other vertical markets including the oil and gas, agriculture, and the transportation industries."

        "abstract": "In a loss of coolant accident, the fuel rod cladding can overheat and burst open exposing the nuclear fuel within. It can also react chemically with the residual steam present in the core to release hydrogen, forming a potentially explosive mixture that can challenge containment integrity. Accident-tolerant fuel attempts to prevent these effects by replacing the zirconium-alloy fuel rod cladding with a non-reactive ceramic material such as silicon-carbide (SiC). Currently, the fuel assembly guide tubes are also made from zirconium alloy, so changing their material to SiC will support the accident-tolerant fuel program. During a reactor accident, keeping the control rods and absorber intact helps prevent a re-criticality. This would be of particular benefit if fresh water with no soluble boron has to be introduced into the vessel to cool the core during the post-accident mitigation phase. The control rod cladding is currently stainless steel that could suffer structural failure during accident conditions. Also, the silver-indium- cadmium (Ag-In-Cd) alloy that is the typical absorber material used in PWR control rods has a low melting point. So in a loss of coolant accident during which the control rods could overheat and fail, the potential exists for the absorber to melt and drain out of the core leading to a potential re-criticality. The purpose of this Phase II project is to continue development of the manufacturing processes required for SiC control rods and guide tubes and replacement absorber materials. The results of the Phase I project will be used to refine the design for the control rods and guide tubes. The analyses performed in Phase I will be updated to include test results from Phase I and additional analyses including seismic analyses and absorber swelling will be performed. A full-scale, partial-length fuel assembly and control rod assembly will be fabricated along with the required guide structure to simulate reactor internals. These components will be used to perform SCRAM tests to characterize performance.The need for irradiation tests will be determined and flow tests with the guide tube and control rod will be completed. This work is required to allow implementation of these accident-tolerant materials in commercial nuclear reactors."

        "abstract": "The Department of Energy is soliciting an emergency hydrogen refueler for an individual consumer fuel cell vehicle. With sparse hydrogen filling stations at present, operators of fuel cell powered vehicles can experience range anxiety lessening the appeal of these vehicles. Skyhaven Systems, LLC is developing an emergency hydrogen refueler that can be stored in the vehicle trunk and used by the consumer to refill the vehicle if they run out of hydrogen fuel away from a hydrogen fueling station. A chemical hydride and water conduit system were developed and demonstrated in a Phase I program to safely react producing hydrogen gas with the requisite purity for a fuel cell vehicle. Material and refueler optimization focused on reacting 100% of the chemical hydride to hydrogen in a refueling period on the order of 15 minutes. Operational prototype hydrogen refuelers will be developed in the Phase II project that can produce 750 g of hydrogen gas to refill a fuel cell vehicle for a 50 mile driving range. The Phase II project will focus on material optimization, refueler design, codes and standards, hazmat and reliability assessment, manufacturing of the refueler, and prototype testing. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: Performance metrics for this refueler include a total mass of 10 kg, a compact space of 11 liters, a reliable system with no moving parts, and a $199 sale price. With these competitive metrics, fuel cell vehicle owners can economically store this refueler in the car trunk being assured that they will not be stranded if they run out of hydrogen gas far removed from a refueling station."

        "abstract": "In an ideal model, emitted CO2 could be used as a feedstock for producing carbon based solid products and chemicals products and intermediaries. In addition to providing economic stimulus to the U.S. manufacturing industry, the displacement of traditional synthesis routes for these chemicals from fossil fuels would help to secure U.S. energy supplies. Chemical products from the Skyre\u2019s Electrochemical Carboxylic Acid (ECA) Generation system, which are not based on petrochemicals, would be utilized as feedstocks to important secondary chemical processes, lowering the U.S. demand for foreign crude oil. The intrinsic value of these products, combined with a low-cost method of producing them, transforms the economic equation in such a way that a societal problem becomes an opportunity. Electrochemical conversion of CO2 can generate a wide range of products including alcohols, alkanes, carboxylic acids and other hydrocarbons. Carboxylic acids are particularly interesting since they can be formed by breaking only one of the carbon-oxygen bonds within the CO2 molecule and are used extensively as chemical intermediates, food additives, tanning agents, dyeing compounds and even in fracking operations. Skyre has proven that it has the basis for a commercially viable system to convert CO2 to organics, namely valuable carboxylic acids. Improvements in catalyst loadings and cell design during the Phase I program has resulted in high Faradaic efficiency, a maximum of 94%. Future cell and stack design optimization has been identified that will allow lower voltage and higher current density operation that will in turn yield commercial CO2 system organics product costs. In the proposed DOE Phase II effort, Skyre will continue the development of electrocatalysts for enhanced performance, make cell design improvements, scale up the laboratory benchtop system for demonstration. Key objectives include: Performance and durability testing to demonstrate Faradaic efficiencies of &gt;90% in producing carboxylic acids and 1,000 hours of operation with "

        "abstract": "The US continues to need improvements in capability to deal with the imminent threat of theft of nuclear weapons from a foreign storage facility by a terrorist cell with insider assistance. At the heart of this challenge is the need to develop alternative signature exploitation technologies, taggants, that can be easily observed using sensors capable of detection over large areas and at high resolutions. One approach to addressing this vulnerability is to locate, monitor and track WMD from strategic distances using airborne sensors operating at HSI, IR, radar, lidar, FTIR, among others. The proposed Phase I and Phase II effort is to develop a taggant that can be covertly integrated onto assets that require tracking. The proposed tracking system will allow identification of the tag from distances of 10 km or greater and can be identified using either an active or passive querying system. Phase I fabricated and measured the infrared reflectance spectrum of fiber samples for their IR properties. This effort verified the properties were as expected from computational models and simulations and demonstrated the feasibility of these fibers being utilized as an optical taggant material. In Phase II the fibers will be modified in their optical layered design in order to give a specific type of emissivity contrast which is easily observable and distinctive compared to background. Following laboratory experiments, optical measurements will be carried out in a field test environment with standoffs up to 1 km, possibly using actual drone platforms. Modelling will show the taggant size\/optical system aperture to allow identification of the tags from a variety of distances, up to LEO. The taggant materials will be tested for environmental ruggedness to stand up to weather, sun and humidity. Covert versions of the material will be demonstrated. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: Beyond its utility for non-proliferation, PBFT technology will find uses for military friend-foe identification, homeland security, geophysics or cold regions research, satellite-visible labeling of ocean shipping containers, trains or trucks, tracking of waste in ocean currents, and other commercial and environmental applications."

        "abstract": "In most wind turbine cases, in the absence of maintenance and repair the polymer composite blades\u2019 service life can be significantly diminished compared to original estimates, and the overall turbine efficiency can severely suffer. Current repair products such as epoxy-based fillers and\/or solvent-based paints have very limited abrasion-resistancecapabilities. In addition, wind protection tapes cannot be applied over chipped and damaged leading\/trailing edges and have poor adhesion capabilities. This Small Business proposes to develop a novel, tough and durable thermoplastic powder-coating material for wear protection of wind turbine blades. The technical feasibility of the proposed coating was successfully demonstrated in Phase I. In rain-erosion and sand-erosion tests conducted in-house the proposed thermoplastic coating significantly outperformed two commercial benchmark coatings and one commercial benchmark paint currently employed in leading edge erosion. Rain erosion tests conducted on the proposed coating at a third party laboratory also produced excellent results. Finally, the proposed coating was successfully thermally-deposited over the leading edge of an 8.3m long wind turbine blade. The coating materials developed in the Phase I study will be further matured in Phase II. The Phase I work plan has seven main technical tasks: 1) Establish project performance goals, 2) Further mature Phase I coating, 3) Laboratory evaluation and testing, 4) Evaluate technology on scale parts, 5) Powder manufacturing process, 6) System demonstration to interested parties, and 7) Transition plan for product launch. At the conclusion of the Phase II effort, the Small Business will have a novel newly developed polymer thermal spray coating ready to be marketed to the wind industry. This coating will be an integral part of the application system that has been fully characterized and is poised for commercialization. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: Ongoing discussions with a major worldwide wind turbine provider have emphasized the significant abrasion problems caused by heavy rain and sustained winds to the leading edge of wind turbine blades and have highlighted the critical need for abrasion protection of such blades. This established relationship makes this major worldwide wind turbine provider an ideal starting point in the search for business partners to substantiate commercialization efforts."

        "abstract": "First commercial High Temperature Superconductors (HTS) are all tape shaped (widths &gt; 10 times thickness), because achieving useful current densities required them to be processed into tape form, even though this also makes it more problematic to use them in some important coil types, for example in ramped and ac field modes; compact, high uniformity solenoid coils; and in large coils where low inductance must be achieved via high current, cabled windings. Our product is the first HTS in commercially usable wire forms that can also be cabled into low loss coil windings. It is based on the 2212 (Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8) HTS material. We have established that among HTS options, only 2212 can be processed to attain useful current densities in wire forms similar to LTS, while surpassing LTS in field generating and operating temperature capability. We have also determined that 2212 is the only HTS that can be 1) cabled into low loss, high current configurations that are required for many ac and ramped field applications, 2) produced with the superconducting joints that are vital for many applications, and 3) scaled up and produced at lower cost than HTS tapes. During the Phase I award period, we developed a test bed and used it to prove the feasibility of manufacturing strong round Bi2212 wire, including equipment and techniques to pre-form the strips to the diameter of the 2212 wire core, payoffs, strip wrapping onto the wire, and diffusion bonding of the strips to the wire. In a series of tests, we demonstrated that these wires are strengthened as required, capable of being bent to small diameters, carry the same currents as unreinforced wires, and can also be cabled such that the cabled wires carry similar currents as un-cabled wires. Our objective continues in Phase II to be develop strong round 2212 wires that are similar in form to proven commercial Nb3Sn round wires, and that, by virtue of their forms, low losses, and superior current densities in very high magnetic fields, offer advantages over present commercial HTS tapes, MgB2 wires and LTS wires in a number of important magnet systems. In Phase II, long length production capability for producing strong, round, high Je, multifilament Bi2212 wire, as well as a representative low loss current cable, will be established (&gt; 100 m wires and &gt; 50 m long cables). Both wire and cable design will also be advanced to enable the design and fabrication of Bi2212-based HTS wires and cables to a wide range of operating current levels, tensile stress \/ load tolerances, and ramped \/ ac operation as well as persistent current modes. The suitability of these wire and cables for use in a variety of coils will also be demonstrated by the fabrication and testing of representative solenoid and racetrack coils."

        "abstract": "The Industrial Internet of Things (IoT) is growing rapidly and is creating the need for a more decentralized and secure way to integrate (IoT) devices into Smartgrid and power plant control system infrastructure. With an estimated 212 Billion sensor-enabled IoT devices to be deployed by 20201, these internet-connected devices will need to be managed differently than the current centralized approaches used today. Current centralized approaches are not able to adequately deal with the emerging Cybersecurity threats that are being created by the convergence of industrial control systems with the IoT. While Blockchain technologies can assist with creating trusted data, currently available blockchain technologies are not suited to the unique technical requirements of Industrial IoT, power system-based IIoT networks, and Cyber-Physical Systems. Current barriers of blockchain-based systems include: excessive transaction fees, scalability problems, and unacceptable latency issues. The problem is being addressed by the novel application of a modified blockchain-based software and Cybersecurity platform which supports cybersecure transactions between Power Systems and IoT devices (sensor\/actuator networks, power system controls, and industrial Internet systems). The proposed novel platform approach solves the inherent limitations of Blockchain by modifying the architecture to enable scalable cybersecure communications, protect integrity, authenticity, auditability, and consistency of all transactions as well as elimination of transaction fees, scalability, and latency issues. We also add a 10-layer patent pending Entry-to-Endpoint\u2122 Cybersecurity profile and our Taekion Platform. For Phase 2, Evolution7 Labs will commercialize the E-Blockchain\u2122 software platform developed in Phase I. The Taekion platform and E-Blockchain application is the first softwaredefined Cybersecurity platform built on a Polychain (Blockchain) architecture that enables cybersecure exchange of information\/value for Power Systems and Industrial IoT environments. The platform utilizes the Taekion\u2122 Token for both Entry-to-Endpoint Security\u2122 Validation and to enable microtransactions which could be simple information transfer or sophisticated low latency control commands. We designed the Taekion\u2122 Platform using security-first principles to create a horizontal fabric (set of protocols and applications) needed to protect both Internet connected and offline systems (Cyber-Physical Systems, IoT Devices, and Endpoints) which is well suited for power system-based IIoT networks. The product will be ready for beta testing and commercialization in Phase II of this SBIR project.Commercial Applications and Other Benefits\nCommercial applications include Cybersecurity-enhanced software applications to be integrated into existing power plant and industrial control system vendors such as General Electric, Siemens, OSISoft and ABB. Other applications include Energy Company vendors providing smart energy control systems to commercial and industrial customers and utility operators."

        "abstract": "The cost of the accelerating waveguide in modern medical accelerators and industrial linacs is substantial. This comes to no surprise, as the accelerating waveguide is a set of diamond \u2013 turned copper resonators brazed together. Such a multistep manufacturing process is not only expensive, but also prone to manufacturing errors, which decrease the production yield. In the big picture, the cost of the accelerating waveguide precludes the use of accelerators as a replacement option for radioactive sources. This is especially true for systems intended for operation in an environment with electricity, temperature, humidity, and water supply issues. Ultimately, an inexpensive and robust accelerator is needed. Euclid Techlabs LLC proposes a revolutionary brazeless accelerating structure made out of copper-plated stainless steel or tungsten cells, with copper irises serving as gaskets for vacuum and RF seals. Skipping the brazing step and using stainless steel components reduces the costs compared to copper. Because of a higher radiation screening efficiency for stainless steel or tungsten, the shielding weight is also reduced. Brazeless design allows the addition of cooling channels and embedded focusing magnets for performance optimization. Embedded focusing\/steering elements allow for a small bore, lower current focusing coil for a significant weight and space reduction. In Phase I we designed and fabricated a full-featured brazeless accelerating structure with microwave coupler. Field balance tuning was first demonstrated in a low power test. Then a vacuum test was performed, followed by high power testing (conditioning) of the structure. The structure was conditioned to a 10 MV\/m gradient. There was no damage observed to the copper-plated surfaces, and minor multipactor-related damage was found on structure irises. This was the shortest turnaround time for a high power microwave R&amp;D effort on the smallest budget in our 15 years of experience. In Phase II, we will produce and test several designs for a few MeV accelerator based on this brazeless design approach. A field-emission or thermal electron gun will be incorporated into the design. The ultimate goal is to produce a very inexpensive few MeV electron accelerator. Besides high power tests at our R&amp;D facility in Bolingbrook, IL, we plan to perform an ultra-high power test at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center. The high gradient accelerator community may also benefit from the fast turnaround testing of various materials and geometries based on this brazeless design. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: Besides the industrial application, this robust and inexpensive accelerator will find application as a replacement for radioactive isotopes for use as an irradiation source. Due to increased regulations imposed by US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), there are additional indirect expenses associated with radionuclide-based sources. These expenses are associated with the disposal of the radionuclide source of the irradiator. The proposed inexpensive design makes radiation-on-demand accelerator\u2013based gamma ray sources commercially viable."

        "abstract": "Increasingly stringent exhaust emissions and fuel economy legislation is forcing automotive engine designers to: 1) demand increased pressure ratios from turbocharger compressors to ensure complete fuel combustion, 2) use Exhaust Gas Recirculation for emission reduction, and 3) reduce engine displacement while maintaining or even increasing output power to reduce fuel consumption. These three changes have led to the need for significantly improved turbocharger operability. Specifically, the compressor must operate over a wider flow range, while achieving both high pressure ratios and high efficiency for high and low flows. While a variety of range extension devices have been developed, a novel compressor configuration is proposed which allows a single compressor to mimic the behavior of a small and a large compressor with minimum complexity. Based on the prior development work performed, we anticipate the compressor technology to have the following benefits compared to current commercially available turbochargers: 1) 3% improvement in fuel economy compared to a commercial turbocharger, and 2) significantly larger range, allowing low-flow low-pressure ratio conditions to be achieved that would not be possible with a current commercial turbocharger. In the Phase II project, several candidate configurations will be designed and fabricated, allowing for detailed component testing to be performed. Based on those tests, a preferred configuration will be selected and tested with an engine relevant to automotive gasoline applications to determine overall engine performance enhancements of the novel technology. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: Upon successful completion of Phase II, automotive and truck turbocharger designers and manufacturers can be supplied with intellectual property licensing and associated tools to help them design and\/or produce high performance turbochargers that will operate over a wider range of operating conditions compared to current commercial turbocharger systems, increasing fuel economy and reducing emissions without a significant increase in cost, weight or size."

        "abstract": "Currently there are three types of storage systems used to store dry spent fuel: unshielded canisters in vertically-oriented shielded overpacks or silos, unshielded canisters horizontally oriented in concrete modules, and shielded casks. Different types of damage are possible for all three systems. The health and safety of the public will be best protected if the containment and shielding surrounding spent fuel in dry storage remains intact or is restored as soon as possible following a breach. Repairing a damaged storage system if it can be done remotely should provide a significant ALARA benefit compared to removing the fuel and replacing the damaged container since it should reduce the radiation exposure of the personnel involved in the process. If the dry cask storage system were replaced instead of repaired, then there is additional cost associated with disposing of a massive component that may be highly contaminated. A repair process for a damaged system will offer cost savings and a reduction in the radioactive waste produced. The purpose of this project is to develop a working prototype of a remotely operated system for performing repairs on spent fuel dry storage systems. The Phase I project identified the types of damage that could be incurred and determined options for repairing the damage. Based on the studies in Phase I, a concept for a remote repair system was developed that can implement the required repairs. The Phase II work plan is primarily structured around scaling up the Phase I research to full scale hardware; testing a broader range of failure modes and dry storage system geometries; and doing this in an operating environment that closely simulates what will be encountered during a field repair campaign. The concept from Phase I will be fully developed and a prototype system will be fabricated and tested utilizing full-scale, reduced-length non-radioactive canister mockups. The Phase II test program will culminate with at least two simulations; one to represent a horizontal cask and the other to represent a vertical configuration. In these simulations the full-scale, reduced-length, prototype canisters and the prototype repair system will be used to simulate a complete canister repair campaign from start to finish including system setup, canister extraction, defect repair, debris containment, canister reseating, and system teardown."

        "abstract": "This proposal is submitted in response to the SBIR\/STTR High Energy Physics Topic 26(a), \u201cSuperconductor Technologies for Particle Accelerators, (a) High-Field Superconducting Wire Technologies for Magnets\u201d. Grant applications are sought to develop new or improved superconducting wire for high field magnets that operate at 16 Tesla (T) field and higher. Nb3Sn is still the primary superconductor being used for the CERN upgrade, the HL-LHC project, and is presently considered as the baseline superconductor for the Future Circular Collider (FCC) design study. The minimum target non-Cu Jc for a potential FCC should be greater than 1500 A\/mm2at 16T-4.2K. The above target performance is much beyond the present state-of-the-art. There is a need for 40% improvement of Jc. A simple extrapolation and improvement of existing strand architectures will not be sufficient, a quantum improvement in performance andanevolutionary change in technology is required. We have been working on creating ternary artificial pinning centers (APC) for the tube type Nb3Sn strands which has successfully doubled the layer Jcs, with Bk up to 26.4 T, and we have made 61 restack wires with APC that have been drawn down to 0.25 mm with 25 \uf06dm subelements. In this Phase II, we will confirm the new methods to make ternary APC wires by doping in the APC tube type Nb3Sn strands. We will continue to optimize the Ternary wire including the selection of precursors, the precursor (e.g., Sn\/Cu\/oxide) ratios, the I.D.\/O.D. of Nb-alloy tubes, the powder packing density and the powder quality, thereby increasing non-Cu Jc to 2100 A\/mm2 at 15 T 4.2 k and 1600 A\/mm2 at 16 T 4.2 k, which will be above the FCC specification. We will make higher count restack strand to get 35 \u00b5m filaments at 0.7 mm diameter strand. Commercial applications and other benefits: The other commercial applications of this advanced Nb3Sn strands are high field 7-11T MRI, NMR systems, superconducting accelerators - protron radiation for cancer treatment, SMES, and high field magnetic separation. According to a U.S. EPA article, more than 97% of the 15,000 accelerators in use around the world have commercial applications, e.g. in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, the locating of oil and minerals in the earth, the processing of semiconductor chips for computers, determination of the age of materials through radiocarbon dating, the sterilizing of medical equipment and food products."

        "abstract": "Successful commercialization and market adoption of electric drive vehicles (EVs) requires development of fast-charge capable Li-ion storage technologies that can deliver &gt;350Wh\/kg, well above what can be achieved with current battery materials. Implementation of next generation cathode and anode materials is needed to further increase specific energy of Li-ion cells. However, without pre-lithiation, some of the most promising anode materials that have high capacity but low efficiency cannot be used. CAMX Power proposes to develop a safe and scalable pre-lithiation technology that will enable the use of very high capacity, long life, but low first cycle efficiency Si-based anodes to demonstrate lithium-ion cells capable of meeting specific energy, power, and life targets for EV batteries. Moreover, this prelithiation technology will enable the use of fast-charge capable but low first cycle efficiency carbon anodes that have a potential to achieve extreme fast charge EV batteries. We will leverage our CAM-7\u00ae cathode material and our work on Si-based and carbon anodes to demonstrate lithium-ion cells that utilize pre-lithiation and are able to meet the 350Wh\/kg target while providing fast charge capability. The Phase I program demonstrated the feasibility of the pre-lithiation technology for substantially improving cell specific energy for the EV applications and potential improvement in achieving long life during fast charge operation. Specifically, during the Phase I effort, we assessed the impact of active materials on the extent of pre-lithiation achieved and tested different pre-lithiation process parameters and environmental stability of pre-lithiated electrodes. Pre-lithiation was then demonstrated with a Sicontaining anode, first in coin cells and then in 200mAh pouch cells, to show how this technology can be scaled.Commercial Applications and Other Benefits\nProposed technology will enable production of fast-charge capable batteries with &gt;350Wh\/kg specific energy making it extremely attractive for implementation in both portable power and EV batteries. By increasing the energy density of EV batteries, and thus increasing the driving range of vehicles between recharges, while bringing EV charge rates closer to refueling times for ICE vehicles we anticipate this technology will further lead to increased market adoption of electric vehicles."

        "abstract": "To mitigate challenges in transporting and storing energy from distributed off-grid small-scale energy harvesters, there is the need for research and development of innovative marine andhydrokinetic systems that produce nonelectric products such as hydrogen and fresh water, which may be unlimitedly stored and easily transported. A novel system, which meets agency requirements, has been developedanddemonstratedinthe Phase I effort and proposed to be productized in Phase II. The system is based on reverse electrodialysis to convert a salinity gradient between river- and seawaters into electrical power, which is applied to the deionization of river water by electrodialysis, resulting in hydrogen production by proton exchange membrane electrolysis and accumulation of this hydrogen in low-pressure, metal-hydride storage. The power conversion balance was analyzed, and the membrane stack power harvesting density of ~1 W\/m2 and hydrogen generation rate of 3.37 mg\/min (37.7 mL\/min) per m2 of membrane stack were experimentally demonstrated, thus confirming the feasibility of the proposed approach and the efficiency of the novel design for the reverse electrodialysis stack. The exploration of the commercial potential for the proposed system revealed a realistic commercial potential for the proposed system with an expected return on investment in 11 years. With all major aspects of the system\u2019s technical feasibility convincingly demonstrated in Phase I, most of the Phase II resources will be invested in the building and demonstration of a real-scale minimal-configuration pilot system to reveal and mitigate technical challenges, minimize the cost of equipment, and demonstrate the productivity of the proposed system for potential users. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: The improved reverse electrodialysis unit may be used both alone and in complete hydrogen-producing systems to add distributed power sources in multiple locations such as at a river\u2019s estuaries or near desalination plants, which produce significant amounts of concentrated brine. Besides the utilization of additional renewable power resources, the production of concentrated energy (hydrogen) allows for improved power delivery to remote, off-grid locations to feed electrical generators (fuel cells), including those installed in vehicles. Moreover, the distribution of hydrogen-charged storage containers in urban areas allows for a wider use of hydrogen-powered or electric cars, which provide environmental benefits. Because this power is obtained from a renewable source, the cost of hydrogen will be significantly lower than those of current technologies."

This work will improve the manufacturability and sensitivity of devices known as \u201cmicrochannel plates\u201d, which are sensitive to particles and UV light. Specifically the work improves the performance of thin films that are applied to the glass microchannel substrates. The films provide a detectable electron pulse for every particle or photon at the input. Three methods of performance improvement were successfully tested for feasibility. One method produced an entirely new thin film, with desirable performance and manufacturing properties. A rigorous test of these improvement methods will be conducted, to improve the existing state of the art. Additionally, 15 entirely new films will be tested and evaluated for performance. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: Microchannel plates manufactured with this improved format will exceed the performance standard of those in widespread use for particle and light detection."

        "abstract": "Cost and time associated with material waste, quality control, inspection, and manufacturing of nuclear fuel assembly components can be detrimental to nuclear plant design and development. Specifically, holddown springs are prime component examples that inherently carry these issues due to their complex geometries and attachment points. The design engineer must always weigh the manufacturing practices against the operational benefits. To combat this issue, the Department of Energy is highly interested in advancing methods of manufacturing for nuclear energy technologies that allow for easier engineering and commercial production of nuclear fuel assembly component. Proving that complex geometries, holddown springs, can be manufactured with the same design material using additive material technologies shows the nuclear industry that former manufacturing complications are no longer necessary. Additive material technologies also give the designer the option of adding beneficial features to holddown springs and nozzles during the Computer Aided Design (CAD) process that were previously impossible (due to tooling impediments). During Phase II, the spring designs from Phase I that provided promising results will be further refined. The new designs will then be printed in large batches to allow for extensive testing. The testing will include bench testing on single springs and also flow testing to determine pressure drop and life and wear characteristics. The holddown springs will also be analyzed using Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to ensure structural integrity. Using additive material technologies (i.e. metallic 3D printing) minimizes material waste and inspection time while producing fine-tolerance products \u2013 increasing quality \u2013 that frees the designers to focus on component operation, not manufacturing (welding, milling, stamping, etc). The goal at the end of Phase II is to complete the required testing to allow 3D printed holddown spring to be included on a lead test assembly in subsequent years."

        "abstract": "Tokamak magnetic fusion torus shaped nuclear reactors, including the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) have been in development around the world for over half a century and hold the most potential for sustained nuclear fusion electrical generation. To achieve this, ITER and other tokamaks are designed with perhaps the most complex vacuum system ever imagined, requiring more than 400 individual vacuum pumps and each one is exposed to radioactive tritium gas. However, since the late 2000\u2019s, universally adopted 150 cubic meters per hour (m3\/hr) all-metal scroll forevacuum roughing pumps are no longer available, leaving ITER and tokamaks around the world without a critical component necessary for continued nuclear fusion power research. To ensure continued nuclear fusion development domestically and worldwide, Air Squared is developing a 150 m3\/hr liquid cooled all-metal (LCAM) roughing vacuum scroll pump compatible with tritium gas. Air Squared\u2019s LCAM is an improvement over currently unavailable, institutionally preferred, scroll pumps through innovative integration of a patented water cooling system that cools both the fixed and orbiting scroll, increasing volumetric efficiency and reliability. In addition, the triple containment improves safety over the previous state-of-the-art. The LCAM is designed to drop into existing tokamak reactors and to easily integrate into ITER. In Phase I, Air Squared designed, fabricated and tested a one-tenth scale LCAM proof of concept of the patented liquid cooled technology. In Phase II, Air Squared will prototype a full scale 150 m3\/hr model and continue testing on air, helium, and hydrogen. Successful development of the LCAM tritium scroll vacuum pump will propel continued international research across all nuclear fusion institutions. Hundreds of these all-metal pumps are estimated to be installed across the fusion industry, but no existing pump meets the precise specifications of tritium pumping for magnetic fusion. A successful LCAM project would meet this industry need, providing the necessary infrastructure to achieve thermonuclear power. Further, successful development of an innovative liquid cooled design may be integrated into several existing and future scroll technologies, increasing scroll performance, efficiency, and competitiveness. Given industry recognition of an all-metal liquid cooled scroll roughing vacuums, tertiary market opportunities would open in the corrosive and toxic etching processes fundamental to semiconductor microfabrication for the LCAM. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: The larger societal impact will be the revolutionary breakthrough of zero-emission, megawatt scale electrical generation. Between a 500 megawatt fusion plant and coal plant powering 250,000 homes, consider the following comparison. Both provide continuous load electricity 365 days a year, but while the coal plant would consume 45 rail cars of coal per day and emit 15,000 tons of CO2, 300 tons SO2, and 40 tons of NO2, a fusion plant would produce the same amount of power while consuming only 1 \u00bc pounds of hydrogen isotopes and emit 1 pound of helium per day."

        "abstract": "The Department of Energy\u2019s National Nuclear Security Administration Office of Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation is tasked with detection and identification of new and emerging sources of illicit production and transportation of nuclear-related materials and technology. A variety of sensor modalities providing data at various spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions exist to aid the detection of targets of interest, such as nuclear fuel production sites. Exploiting literal and non-literal data at multiple spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions requires expertise in many technical aspects of imagery analysis, and is challenging and time-consuming. Many sensors have specialized algorithms unique to their system, requiring specialized analysis and visualization tools. Additionally, some non-literal systems like Synthetic Aperture Radar and Hyperspectral Imaging require special training and a unique set of algorithms for interpretation. To address these challenges, Aret\u00e9 is developing automated fusion algorithms that can manage different sensor modalities collected at different times and from different geometries. These algorithms will enhance analysts\u2019 ability to extract actionable intelligence from a variety of government and commercial satellite imagery. Under this effort, a rigorous mathematical approach to multimodal data fusion is being developed as the scientific basis for combining data streams from multiple imaging sensors. The algorithms and framework developed here will provide the basis for combining and exploiting a variety of sensor modalities such as synthetic aperture radar, hyper-spectral and panchromatic imagery, video imagery, lidar point clouds, and other sensor types that may become available. The fused data products will improve and accelerate the current analysis chain by improving automated detection and classification algorithms relevant to the Office of Proliferation Detection, as well as providing a more informative and intuitive visualization and data interface for Proliferation Detection analysts. In Phase-I, the data fusion algorithms were developed and demonstrated against local data sets. Based on this success, a Phase-II effort is proposed that will be used to mature and refine the algorithms and implement them into an end-to-end fusion framework. This framework will be developed towards transition to PD analyst end users. Components of the framework will simultaneously be commercialized as GeoKit, as fusion module integrated as a plug-in for satellite image provider platforms. The work done under this effort will benefit proliferation detection analysts by making them more effective and efficient at detecting and monitoring nuclear fuel production facilities. The same algorithms will benefit a number of commercial and government programs that use commercial or satellite imagery."

        "abstract": "Supercritical CO2 power cycles offer the promise of high efficiency in a compact footprint with a potential to offer disruptive changes to the US energy infrastructure. Applications include bottom cycles for electric co-generation power plants, nuclear power production, concentrated solar and other renewables as well as propulsion engines for space propulsion. Aerodynamic design theory dictates that the turbomachinery components for such power cycles will operate at high rotation speed with high-power density. Given these high operating speeds and performance requirements such as operation to 700oC, traditional off-the-shelf bearing technology is not available. MiTi\u2019s 5th and 6th generation foil bearings are ideal candidates for integration into the necessary turbomachinery components of these power cycles. Phase I established the viability of using compliant foil bearings in sCO2 turbomachinery through analysis and testing of coated foil elements exposed to sCO2 at &gt;700\u00b0C and subsequently undergoing tribological testing. Results show that the foil and coating were unaffected by sCO2. The proposed program begins with detailed design of the hardware test rig, foil bearings and radial seals, followed by methodical testing of the test foil bearing and seals in air, CO2 and sCO2 environments. Testing will characterize both foil bearing\/seal dynamic and tribological performance in the three environments in order to validate the design and design analysis capabilities. Testing in air will provide the baseline performance for subsequent comparison with measurements in CO2 and sCO2 environments. Measured performance parameters will include liftoff speed, foil temperatures, shaft displacement as a function speed and frequency content in order to identify system response and stability (i.e., functions of bearing stiffness and damping) and load carrying capacity. Posttest examination of the foil bearing\/seal will allow for assessment of potential tribological interactions during operation due to the sliding wear encountered during startup and shut down as well as possible high-speed rub during load capacity testing conditions. The results of testing with sCO2 will provide the basis for using foil bearings\/seals in sCO2 turbogenerator and other extreme environment systems. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: The foil bearing is a key enabling technology paramount to the success of the supercritical CO2 power cycle. MiTi has demonstrated scalability of the bearing technology from 8 mm to 150 mm diameters. Such scalability will support the development of multi-megawatt supercritical CO2 cycles that will reduce the environmental impact of large scale centralized energy production. Beyond supercritical CO2 applications, advancements in compliant foil bearings will provide industry exposure and open avenues for the technology into other parallel energy solutions such as natural gas and pipeline compressors, hydrogen fuel cells, liquid refrigerant compressors, cryogenic turbopumps, ammonia compressors and turbogenerator systems including Closed Brayton Cycles for terrestrial and space power."

        "abstract": "Small Modular Reactors are one of the most compelling options for meeting the growing clean energy demands of the U.S. While safer and costing less to build and operate than their conventional counterparts, there are fundamental design differences between traditional commercial nuclear power plants and small modular reactors that require the development of new and innovative sensors and measurement techniques to control and monitor the safety of the plants. This is a proposal for development of new sensors capable of meeting small modular reactor measurement needs, adaptation of existing and emerging sensing technologies capable of being used in small modular reactors, and development of commercially viable maintenance practices to enable safe and efficient operation of small modular reactors. In Phase I, the proposing firm investigated the challenges and measurement needs of leading small modular reactor designs and demonstrated the feasibility of new sensor technologies. In the Phase II project, prototype sensors and sensor testing technologies were developed and demonstrated in process conditions representative of small modular reactors. The Phase IIB project will build up on the results of the Phase I and Phase 2 projects to develop technologies that will provide small modular reactors vendors with 1) guidance on selection, testing, qualification, installation, and maintenance of sensors and cables, 2) laboratory and field testing services to small modular reactor vendors like NuScale as they progress towards design certification and commercial deployment, 3) maintenance procedures for in-situ testing of sensor and cable performance and 4) guidelines for sensor and cable aging management and potential replacement schedules. COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS AND OTHER BENEFITS: The Phase IIB project will enable the proposing firm to develop commercial equipment and techniques that are needed to test sensors for process measurements in small modular reactors. The equipment and methodologies proposed in this project will enable small modular reactor manufacturers to practically and economically verify the performance of their critical sensors and cables. These efforts will pave the way for successful deployment of small modular reactors in the United States and other countries."

        "abstract": "Continued use of nuclear power is critical to meeting carbon emission goals and ensuring national security. Nuclear power production will rely on both current generation (LWR and PWR) as well as next generation designs including very-high-temperature, molten-salt, supercritical- water-cooled, gas-cooled, sodium-cooled, and\/or lead-cooled reactors. The development and deployment of these high temperature and harsh environment reactors will require advanced sensors capable of operating in these environments. Luna\u2019s core technology lies in Optical Frequency Domain Reflectometry (OFDR) utilizing the Rayleigh backscatter and\/or Fiber Bragg Gratings within optical fiber to make temperature measurements. By adding a structure to the end of the fiber creating a Fabry-Perot Interferometer pressure can be measured using the same data system. Materials would be selected such that they are compatible with the anticipated environment and packaged into a deployable unit that could be installed into research and commercial facilities. This technology will provide for enhanced methods of measuring temperature and pressure in the same fiber simultaneously. During the Phase II effort, Luna will build on the success of the Phase I project. The key PhaseII efforts will be to advance sensor analysis algorithms; fabricate sensors using multiple promising fiber types; package sensors to withstand molten salt, molten metal, high-temperature steam, and high-temperature water environments; and finally sensor operation in a research reactor for a duration that provides a total fluence on the order of 1019n\/cm2. Throughout the Phase II effort, Luna will stay in contact with its industry partners towards defining and developing a final deployment package that best meets the needs of our future customers. Commercial applications and other benefits: Simultaneous temperature and pressure measurement instrumentation will enable safe operation of Gen-IV reactor designs and PWR (pressurized water reactors) and other Gen-III reactor designs already in operation with a reduction of pressure vessel feedthrough per sensor required. Since the developed sensors will be radiation tolerant and high-temperature capable, they will also find application in space probes, rocket engine monitoring, rocket engine development and in gas turbine health monitoring."

        "abstract": "Over 1 billion people suffer from the effects of water scarcity and a great majority of those affected live near a coastline in developing countries, on islands, and in remote communities. To satisfy the potable water needs of a rapidly growing world population, experts agree that seawater desalination on a large scale is required. However, while seawater desalination can solve many global water security issues, desalination systems typically require a connection to a strong and reliable electrical grid for their power supply. Because our target customers lack access to sufficient grid capacity and cannot afford the capital or time required to build adequate grid infrastructure, cost-effective seawater desalination systems that can operate \u201coff grid\u201d are needed. Near-shore ocean waves provide an inexhaustible, consistent, and widely distributed energy resource accessible to a high percentage of the world population. Resolute Marine has been developing and testing several prototypes of an oscillating flap wave energy converter since 2012 and our objective is to now couple this device to a novel seawater compatible pump for powering reverse osmosis desalination systems. The developed technology will displace environmentally damaging diesel generators which are in wide use worldwide. In Phase I RME created an integrated suite of numerical models to assess the dynamic performance of a wave-powered, reverse osmosis desalination system utilizing flap driven pumps to directly pressurize sea water for delivery to an on-shore desalination plant and companion electric \u201chouse-power\u201d generation\/energy storage plant. The proposed Phase II work will entail creating Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) testing capabilities that emulate a fully integrated wave powered desalination system at one-fifth scale. The HIL test program will validate the numerical models under a range of expected operational sea-state conditions and provide a test bed for hardware and control system developments to support planned full scale technical and commercial pilot projects. In addition to solving water security issues, wave-powered desalination plants may provide a quiet, low-cost water supply for resorts, marinas, and seaside communities interested in capitalizing on their renewable energy resources.Disaster relief organizations, including the U.S. military, will appreciate the fact that the developed technology can be deployed and fully operational within a matter of days after a catastrophic event. Additionally, the technology may be configured to provide electric power exclusively, thus enhancing the portfolio of renewable energy options available to consumers and electric power providers."

        "abstract": "Solar module warranties are typically 25 years or longer, a striking reliability requirement that allows only a slow performance degradation with time. There are very few products built today that are required to exhibit this type of longevity. In the past decade, to improve the quality of their products, high-performance cell manufacturers developed and implemented various inline process control machines that could detect poorly performing or defective cells.Low cost module manufacturers are still less likely to use the full suite of inspection steps, and even with full implementation of inline inspection it has not been possible to eliminate long-term field failures. This suggests that outdoor inspection techniques must be developed and deployed, and these must be capable of scanning a significant fraction of the installed modules to detect the most common failure modes in a statistically significant manner. With this outdoor reliability information in hand, financiers and bankers can reward high-reliability manufacturers with lower cost of capital, directly lowering the Levelized Cost of Energy, a direct benefit to U.S. consumers. This project proposes to develop a ruggedized outdoor scanner that will be used during nighttime hours to detect and quantify various defect types in installed solar modules. It will operate in a non-contact mode: the modules do not need to be unplugged or otherwise disturbed during the process, and high resolution electroluminescence images of the module defects will be collected and automatically analyzed. In Phase I, we designed, built and demonstrated a prototype non-contact scanner that was delivered to a US PV R&amp;D customer for initial testing and feedback. In Phase II, we will design and implement an automated scanning platform [buggy], as well as the data analysis algorithms and infrastructure so that the machine can autonomously collect information and generate detailed statistical reports. Demand for these outdoor techniques is expected to be robust, and finance companies such as Deutsche Bank have called for this type of outdoor metrology: the installation rate of solar modules has continued to rise over the past decade, and while conservative models such as World Energy Outlook 2015 predicted a relative slowdown in 2017-2020 (with worldwide installations hovering near 40GWp\/year), actual installation rates are robust and on track to exceed 100GWp\/year during 2018. As US customers demand higher reliability, faster-payback investments, more of these installations will be inspected for both initial quality and to measure the year-over-year degradation."

        "abstract": "Because it can be used in situ without the need for any sample preparation, optical emission spectroscopy (OES) techniques, such as laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) are favored as a spectroscopic tool to remotely detect and interrogate nuclear materials. Although they have been successfully demonstrated in the lab, results taken at test fields are lacking because high laser intensity is needed at standoff distances. Furthermore, the return signal from optical interrogation drops drastically as 1\/r2with r being the distance from the detector to the sample. We propose using optical vortices to confine the optical LIBS emission within a small conic angle to increase its signal strength, particularly in the direction of the user for remote sensing applications. This is different when using Gaussian beams for LIBS where the emission of laser plasma is isotropic. We have successfully demonstrated in Phase I that the detected signal strength can be doubled when using vortices compared to conventional Gaussian beams without additional improvement or modification to the laser system. Vortices are also known to be particularly robust against atmospheric turbulences. This will enable a stronger and precise intense laser beam delivery at range for interrogation of nuclear materials. Furthermore, our technology can be applied to various nanosecond, picosecond and femtosecond laser pulses, and can be used not only in LIBS, but also for absorption, fluorescence and Raman spectroscopy. In addition to using optical vortices for LIBS, we will combine Gaussian and vortex beam collinearly to further increase the LIBS signal at the detector. These Gaussian and vortex beams may be femtosecond, nanosecond or both, and be of different wavelengths. Outdoor LIBS experiments are also planned to demonstrate the viability of this technology for field applications. Because of the versatility of optical vortices for ablation, we will also develop an optical spectrometer based on dual frequency comb for multi-element and multi-isotope detection of nuclear materials. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: The proposed technology using high energy nanosecond optical vortices will be able to detect a wide range of materials, such as explosives, organic, radiological and special nuclear materials at standoff distances. Due to its long-range capability, this sensor can also be used for weather monitoring LIDAR, remote sensing, optical communication and material processing. Our dual frequency comb will be an alternative to mass spectrometer for on-site field tests of nuclear materials."

        "abstract": "The purpose of this DOE Phase 2 grant application is to further validate the geothermal HVAC installation savings made evident from our Phase 1 research. Moreover, it is to commercialize the solutions that will make these savings possible. This is important because geothermal HVAC systems are the most energy-efficient heating\/cooling system known, according to the DOE. But the technology has not gone mainstream because of the higher first cost compared to conventional HVAC systems. The incremental cost of geothermal over conventional HVAC systems is typically 40-80% and mostly if not entirely due to the bore-field. This is because drilling 100-500 feet bore-holes is costly when the geology can vary from site to site and the appropriate drilling equipment and\/or professional experience may or may not be readily available. Our goal is to reduce the incremental cost of geothermal by 50% or more and thereby better ensure the energy savings achieve a net positive cash flow for the owner. While the current tax credits of 30% for residential and 10% for commercial are helpful, these incentives will expire in the next 5 years so the industry needs to achieve a lower first cost basis to continue growing and eventually become the preferred heating\/cooling system for home and building owners. At present, geothermal only has about 1-3% of the total HVAC market. Our Phase 1 research shows that the size of the geothermal bore-field can be reduced up to 40% by optimizing the design\/layout of the bore-field and utilizing phase-change materials (PCMs) in or around the water loop. More specifically, by eliminating bore-holes in the center of the bore-field, ground heat transfer can be improved such that 10-30% fewer bore-holes are necessary. And by adding PCMs in a holding tank or in the bore-hole grout, the number of bore-holes can be reduced another 5-10%. Therefore, two commercial products have been proposed to achieve these bore-field size reductions: (1) Bore-field design software that encourages engineers and contractors to design long or donut- shaped bore-fields to improve heat transfer and thereby minimize the number of bore-holes; (2) PCM tanks (direct heat exchange plus water mass) and\/or infused grout (indirect heat exchange) that store and release energy on a seasonal basis to further minimize the number of bore-holes. We are very excited and motivated to significantly improve our nation\u2019s economy, health, resiliency, and security through this grant opportunity.Thank you for your consideration."

        "abstract": "The cost of anchoring offshore floating wind turbines is an obstacle to reducing the cost of energy from offshore floating wind projects and presents an opportunity for savings. Deep water at sites on the West Coast further drives up these costs. Traditional anchoring systems use large heavy weights, casings, or high drag embedment forces to achieve high-pullout forces required for moorings. High weights and forces ultimately convert into high costs. Triton proposes a robust anchoring system that can be installed with low forces and managed remotely from a generic offshore vessel. This approach is already being adopted as a cost-saving measure for seafloor characterization surveys in deepwater and can provide similar cost savings for mooring installation costs. During Phase I, the team conducted geotechnical studies to generate installation requirements and show the feasibility of the anchoring approach. A preliminary design of the installation system was developed and cost reduction potential of the solution was quantified. In Phase II, the team will move toward commercialization of the anchoring system.Geotechnical analysis and anchor design from Phase I will be refined and extended, a prototype will be developed, and the installation method will be demonstrated. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: This anchoring technology is scalable and applicable to many types of subsea foundations beyond offshore wind, such as oil &amp; gas, pipelines, and other renewable energy systems.Beyond the public benefit of lower cost green energy, the system minimizes acoustic impacts on the environment, and is completely removable."

        "abstract": "Nuclear power is the most environmentally benign way to produce electricity on a large scale. The successful use of nuclear power, however, is dependent upon adequate and safe processing and disposal of spent nuclear fuels. An important feature of nuclear energy is that spent fuels can be reprocessed to recover fissile and fertile materials and then used as fresh fuel for nuclear power plants. In nuclear fuel reprocessing system, centrifugal contactors are used as liquid-liquid extraction devices where two immiscible liquids are mixed at high speeds using a rotor, which creates a fine dispersion of droplets of organic phase in an aqueous phase that contains the analyte. Understanding the extraction efficiency at these contactors through modeling and simulation is important in the development of reprocessing technologies and the optimization of current technologies. A microfluidic flow cell extraction chip with embedded spectroscopic sensors for the analysis of analytes is being developed. The SpectraChip\u2122 sensor will be useful in the optimization of new fuel reprocessing schemes and existing reprocessing processes by providing a microfluidic modeling platform and sensing platform to optimize extraction parameters. The Phase I work developed an MFC chip with integrated Raman and absorption fiber optic probes, demonstrated that the sensors accurately predicts the concentration of analytes by chemometric analysis and demonstrated the feasibility of using Raman and absorption measurements to detect analytes that partition into the aqueous and organic phases in a flowing system in real time. Phase II will develop an MFC chip with embedded Raman and absorption sensors, develop a field deployable SpectraChip\u2122 sensor module, develop the chemometric model for analyte prediction, develop a rapid acquisition and chemometric modeling software, and demonstrate that the SpectraChip\u2122 sensor yieldsextraction parameters that can optimize the extraction process. Commercial applications and other benefits: The SpectraChip\u2122 sensor can be used in drug discovery where it could be used in the purification and detection of analytes. The SpectraChip\u2122 sensor can be used as detectors for separation techniques such as HPLC and capillary zone electrophoresis. These techniques are widely used in the pharmaceutical, environmental, chemical and petrochemical industries."

        "abstract": "One of the key recommended research activities in a recent DOE development roadmap for next generation CSP plants (CSP Gen3) was to develop an in-situ molten salt composition\/chemistry monitoring system. In-situ, real time, online monitoring is the first step in carefully controlling the salts\u2019 composition which is key to achieving thermal performance and reducing corrosion kinetics and grain boundary attack. Salt chemistry stability is a key technology enabler, as system and component design is tied to accurate and reliable thermal properties. It also impacts salt-handling protocols, and operation of critical subsystems. Ideally such a system would need to be: capable of measuring a range of molten salt compositions at target operational temperatures (as high as 800oC); capable of detecting contaminants at relevant concentrations; and rugged\/reliable enough for use in industrial settings. How this problem is being addressed: Sporian Microsystems has previously developed inline, real time, gas and liquid composition monitoring systems for the DOD based on Raman Spectroscopy, and has developed a range of high temperature (1000-1800oC) sensor technologies for the energy industry, and specifically for CSP HTF\/TES fluid monitoring applications. The long term-objective of the proposed effort is to leverage Sporian\u2019s prior work on Raman Spectroscopy and high temperature sensors to realize a Raman based, high temperature capable, molten salt\/HTF composition\/contaminant monitoring system. Done in Phase I: In Phase I Sporian: worked with DOE national labs and industry stakeholders to define key requirements and foster technology transition; developed detailed optical, hardware, electronics, and firmware architecture designs for the complete system including the spectroscopic and high temperature operable subsections; and successfully evaluated\/demonstrated performance and technical feasibility using benchtop scale prototype hardware. Planned for the Phase II Project: The Phase II effort will focus on realizing multiple versions of a commercial oriented molten salt monitoring system, and include: several generations of system design and prototyping; rigorous lab scale testing; and working with academic, national lab, and commercial technical partners to evaluate the systems in the context of ongoing DOE salt research efforts, and to clarify application utility for commercialization.Commercial Applications and Other Benefits\nThe proposed sensor has the potential to improve the efficiency, reliability, and economic viability of CSP systems. This, in turn, will help realize the full potential of CSP to provide clean, sustainable electric power and to enhance America\u2019s energy independence. These harsh environment composition monitoring systems could have a variety of additional applications for nuclear power generation, fossil fuel power generation, concentrating solar fuels, materials processing, and transportation systems."

        "abstract": "The US Department of Energy\u2019s Nuclear Energy Advanced Modeling and Simulation (NEAMS) Toolkithas accelerated both the solutions to existing problems and deployment of new designsfor current and advanced reactors. The task of coupling these tools into integrated workflows has now become a significant impediment to timely, cost-effective modeling and simulation for ad- vanced nuclear system design. The work proposed here will remedy this situation by developingan integrated computational system that will greatly simplify nuclear power system design and analysis, help bring to fruition the many investments that the DOE and other organizations have made in this area, and ensure that nuclear energy remains a critical and safe component of the nation\u2019s energy strategy. In Phase I, Kitware developed tools to define reactor core geometry with an intuitive graphical user interface using Kitware\u2019s Computational Model Builder (CMB) framework.The projectalso provided support for the DIF3D nodal neutronics simulation workflows using CMB\u2019s Mod- elBuilder application and the Simulation Model ToolKit (SMTK) and visualized the results using CMB\u2019s post-processing tools. Finally, the project showed it was possible to integrate the CMB approach with NEAMS Workbench\u2019s Template Engine and that it was possible to execute simula- tions remotely on DOE HPC systems. The overall goal of the Phase II effort is to develop a workflow management infrastructure for supporting the life-cycle of multi-physics reactor core simulations and will assist nuclear en- gineers, scientists, and other stakeholders with handling the complexity of modern simulation- based design and analysis related to nuclear reactor cores. It will be incorporated into the DIF3D neutronics simulationworkflowdevelopedinPhaseI.Inaddition,supportforcomputational fluid dynamics simulations based on the System Analysis Module (SAM) will be developed. Ac-cess to both workflows will be provided using CMB\u2019s ModelBuilder application. Tools will be de- veloped allowing NEAMS Workbench to leverage both workflow support and reactor core mod- eling capabilities within its native user interface. The ability to switch between workflows definedin CMB and NEAMS Workbench will also be implemented, allowing for the use of whichever toolis most appropriate for the current stage of the simulation process. Finally, enhancements will be made to CMB\u2019s reactor core modeling and post- processing capabilities to reduce the time re- quired to define the core models needed by these workflows and to streamline the post-processing pipelines that are associated with key tasks within the workflow.Throughout this project therewill be interaction with the NEAMS Workbench developers, and feedback from end-users and other developers from NEAMS and the nuclear industry will guide the project. Commercial applications &amp; other benefits: This work will further our open-source platform for modeling and simulation workflow. Such a platform provides Kitware with significant business opportunities, as open software platforms lend themselves to a services business model where the company can provide technology integration services with customers and collaborators to build valuable, competitive products and services."

        "abstract": "The promise of fusion energy is enormous - an energy system whose fuel is obtained fromsimple ingredients, and which yields zero carbon emissions to the atmosphere. However, realizing this vision requires undertaking one of the most challenging programs of scientific research and development that has ever been undertaken. Predictive simulation plays a crucial role in fusion energy research. Such simulations providea framework for the creation and evaluation of fusion experiments, and point the way towards viable designs. However, two key problems must be overcome if simulation is to remain effectiveas problem size and complexity increases. First, large-scale computing is producing large amounts of data and consequently data transfer is now the major bottleneck in most simulation workflows. Second, the complexity of multi-physics analyses requires the capability to easily configure software systems into workflows that can handle complex, multi-physics workflows. The scientific community has been working hard to develop the software infrastructure to tackle these challenges. In the proposed work, we will leverage and extend two software libraries that are key parts of this infrastructure: ADIOS and VTK-m. ADIOS is a system for fast, scalable, and portable IO and data transfer. It has been used to integrate diverse simulation and analysis toolsinto complex scientific workflows to address data scaling and multi-physics scientific challenges. However, one of the main difficulties in integrating such diverse tools is the incompatibility between various data models, with existing solutions being home-grown and ad-hoc. Our aim is to tacklethis challenge by integrating ADIOS with VTK-m. VTK-m is a high-performance system that supports a number of abstract data models. The flexibility of this data framework has already been demonstrated in various in situ analysis and visualization applications. Together the combined capabilities of ADIOS and VTK-m will enable scalable IO and support interoperable simulationtools that can be readily integrated into efficient simulation workflows. In our Phase I project, we have demonstrated the feasibility of this approach by developing a prototype system and applyingit to the XGC1 simulation data. This end-to-end prototype was limited to a single data model and a few algorithms. In our Phase II project, we propose to build a production ready end-to-end system that provides complex simulation and data analysis workflows to the fusion community. This system will support in situ, in transit as well as post hoc data analysis and visualization enabling scientists to leverage advanced analysis tools including VTK-m, VTK\/ParaView and SciPy. While the work performed in this SBIR project is focused on fusion simulation, it is part of Kitware\u2019s vision for advanced simulation.We have been building open source platforms which can be customized to meet specific customer needs. Such customization, as well as providing support, engaging in collaborative R&amp;D, and performing technology integration, form the basis ofa service-driven business model. The tools developed here will enable Kitware to more easily build customized software systems, respond to customers more quickly, and expand our footprint in the engineering simulation market."

        "abstract": "Non-petroleum-based resources, such as nanocellulose derived from biofeedstock, are considered an attractive means to meet the increasing societal demand for value-added products. Utilization of these resources will steer the nation toward a self-sustainable bioeconomy, which is in alignment with Department of Energy\u2019s mission to efficiently-utilize nanocellulose and convert it to commercially-viable, high-performance products. Toward meeting this goal, the company is developing supramolecular nanocellulose excipients for oral delivery of protein drugs. Specifically, crystalline nanocellulose from various sources is utilized to form hydrogel excipients for encapsulated drugs resulting in controlled and sustained release. In Phase I, the company successfully formulated hydrogels from crystalline nanocellulose procured from two different sources. The hydrogels were loaded with insulin with an encapsulation efficiency of 82% within 24 hours. The hydrogels were non-toxic to the Colo 205 cell line releasing 100% of the encapsulated protein within 24 hours. The structural integrity of the encapsulated and released insulin was confirmed. In Phase II, the company plans to continue fine-tuning the nanocellulose-based hydrogels to increase: (1) loading capacity, (2) encapsulation efficiency, and (3) increase drug release capability beyond 24 hours. Nanocellulose from multiple sources will be investigated as excipients. The company will perform a detailed techno-economic analysis comparing our nanocellulose-based excipient to various petroleum-based excipients. Commercial applications and other benefits: Supramolecular nanocellulose excipients can find immediate application as a drug excipient for insulin and other protein drugs. The hydrogel material is promising as a drug excipient for its sustained release, which would: (1) improve drug effectiveness, (2) reduce dosing frequency, and (3) improve patient compliance."

        "abstract": "Solar energy is the most potential renewable and sustainable energy source. To achieve high solar-to-electric conversion efficiency and enable cost competitiveness with conventional methods of electric power generation, the next generation of Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) systems is expected to operate at temperatures above 700\u00b0C. Molten chloride salts are identified as a highly promising heat transfer fluid and thermal energy storage media capable of operating between 550\u00b0C and 750\u00b0C. These molten salts introduce a set of technological and engineering challenges because of their very corrosive characteristics for typical materials. In the proposed project, LM Group Holdings, Inc. propose to develop and apply amorphous alloy coatings with high corrosion resistance that will be able to withstand severe environment under molten chloride salt conditions and improved surface characteristics for different parts of the molten salt systems such as impeller, sealant etc. to be able to operate these systems at temperatures above 700\uf0b0C. Amorphous metals are a novel class of materials that have a disordered, non-crystalline, glassy structure. Due to their unique microstructure, amorphous metals combine ultrahigh strength, high hardness and ductility in one single material. Amorphous Metals are more corrosion resistant compared to conventional metals due to the lack of long-range periodicity, related grain boundaries and crystal defects such as dislocations and their compositions. Three different fully and partially amorphous thermally sprayed coatings were generated and optimized to obtain dense and uniform coating microstructure. The optimized coatings were sprayed on Haynes 230 alloy and study regarding their resistance against molten KCl-MgCl2 salt corrosion at 750\uf0b0C for 300 hours. Static capsule exposures were performed on Alloy 230 samples with and without coatings. Uncoated samples experienced intergranular attack and chromium depletion with a median depth of 34 \u00b5m. Coated samples experienced no observable attack on either the metal substrate or in the coatings. The lack of Cr depletion in the coatings is a very promising finding that merits additional study to determine the mechanism. This proposed project will build on LMGH\u2019s extensive prior experience with amorphous metals-based coatings for different applications. LMGH along with ORNL and Sandia CSP facility work to understand the protection mechanism of novel amorphous metal-based coatings under severe corrosive environments and evaluate the corrosion resistance and mechanical integrity for CSP system components under real conditions. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: The coating solution developed under this program would enable rapid adoption and wide-scale commercialization of CSPs which would effectively help the word transition from coal, oil and other fossil fuels to cleaner, more responsible renewable fuel. The scheduled projects under development for numerous solar thermal power plants using CSP technologies are indicative of market growth between now and 2019, at which time the market is expected to grow significantly at a CAGR of 60.2%, from $3 billion to nearly $25.8 billion."

        "abstract": "Technologies that mitigate the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and that displace petroleum-based processes for fuel and chemical production are urgently needed to combat climate change. One promising strategy that can simultaneously accomplish both of these goalsis to use microbes to convert greenhouse gases present in industrial gaseous waste streams into chemicals and fuels that are currently produced from petroleum. During Phase I of this grant, Visolis demonstrated the feasibility of a novel hybrid process that uses engineered microbes to convert gaseous waste streams into a versatile platform molecule that can be further processed into a range of petroleum replacement products. Visolis has already developed catalytic processes to convert the platform molecule into various chemicals that are of high value to the plastics, transportation, and pharmaceutical industries. Our process utilizes the carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen present in industrial waste gases as feedstocks for chemical production, which has the double benefit of reducing costs while also preventingthe release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. During Phase II of this project, we will further optimize our production strains and fermentation parameters in order to increase product titers and yields as well as integrate and scale up our process into a pilot plant. Our fully developed process will produce a portfolio of sustainable, high value, carbon-negative chemicals and carbon-neutral 2nd generation renewable fuels that will be cost-competitive withpetroleum-based processes and fossil fuels."

        "abstract": "The one remaining barrier to achieving a marketable R-10 window is the high manufacturing cost of solderglass-sealed vacuum glass. To remedy this, edge seal material must be changed from meltable solderglass to cold-weldable aluminum foil, speeding up the manufacturing rate by over 700X. Phase I research showed that rod-shaped pane spacers, or whiskers, are the best shape available. They can enable R-10 capable vacuum glass (a DOE windows roadmap goal). Moreover, when annealed glass is used (75% of market), only whiskers enable R-10, while conventional pillars are inherently constrained to R-6. Now that R-10 can be achieved without using a third pane of glass, the focus can move to the seals. The manufacturing cost for first generation vacuum glass is over twice that of dual pane insulating glass. The problem is inherent in the use of solderglass seals, which require a heating-cooling cycle of six hours. In contrast, one dual pane unit can be sealed every 30 seconds. To compete with dual pane, next-generation vacuum glass seal material must migrate from solderglass to aluminum foil, cold-welded directly to glass in only a fraction of a second. To complement this, thermal degassing can be replaced with room-temperature ion peening, and the use of a getter that can finish the evacuation process after seal-off and preserve life for 50 years. In this Phase II project, V-Glass will collaborate with the Edison Welding Institute to migrate the proven V-Glass cold-welding process from an ultrasonic seam welder to an ultrasonic bar welder that is over 100X faster for a single head. To migrate away from thermal degassing, V- Glass will collaborate with the University of Sydney to identify and minimize sources of residual gas that cause vacuum decay. Any remaining residual gas will be scavenged post-sealoff by getters or ion peening. A successful outcome will allow each foil-sealed window to be fabricated in 30 seconds, and maintain vacuum for at least 50 years. The R-10 product will be validated by testing. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: A successful project will provide private investors the confidence they require to build the first commercial R10-capable VIG line as soon as2020, beating time target of the DOE windows roadmap. Widespread use of R-10 windows can reduce total US energy use (and greenhouse gas emissions) as much as 3%, and help position the U.S. at the forefront in a global market totaling $25 billion per year."

        "abstract": "Reducing the size, weight, and increasing the efficiency of automotive traction power inverters requires the development of novel high-voltage, high current silicon carbide high-speed transistors and rectifiers, since the existing silicon technology is severely limited in terms of operating temperature, frequency and energy efficiency. However, the non-optimized device and manufacturing technology currently used for silicon carbide power diode fabrication results in higher energy losses and a non-competitive price point with respect to silicon. Novel device and process technology in combination with the use of a high-volume manufacturing strategy on large diameter silicon carbide wafers is proposed in this proposed program for achieving near-theoretical device performance on high-current power transistors with integrated Schottky rectifiers. The proposed device and manufacturing strategies will drastically reduce the manufacturing costs for silicon carbide Schottky diodes and transistors, making them cost- competitive with the existing silicon technology. Phase I was focused on a proof-of-concept demonstration of the proposed device technology. A major task involved transferring the process technology to a large-scale, high- volume foundry identified in the proposal. Phase II will be focused on scaling the voltage and current ratings of the Phase I demonstrated device to 1700 V and up to 250 Amperes, in line with updated requirements from automotive customers. Detailed reliability investigations pursuant to the industry standards is planned for Phase II. A detailed commercialization strategy will also be implemented during Phase II. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: John Deere is extremely interested in the proposed devices in this program for their next generation of heavy-duty construction vehicles. Electric vehicle power electronics manufacturers such as General Motors, Delphi Automotive and Cummins Power Systems are expected to be direct customers of the proposed silicon carbide devices to be developed in this program. Reducing the weight of the power module, which represents 23% of the total Inverter weight will extend its electric range and\/or reduce the size and cost of the battery. Significantly reduced silicon carbide chip-sizes for the same current rating along with low-cost, high-volume manufacturing strategies proposed in this program will help meet the aggressive power electronics targets set for the electric vehicle industry by the DOE for the year 2022. This in turn will enhance the country\u2019s energy security by reducing dependence on foreign oil, save money by cutting fuel costs for American families and businesses, and result in a cleaner environment by reducing harmful CO2 emissions from gas- powered vehicles."

        "abstract": "There is a clear and unmet need for technologies to improve power generation flexibility to enable cost effective and reliable high renewable energy fractions in modern grids. Specifically, gas turbine generator turndown ratio may be improved by extending combustion lean flammability limits. This project will deliver a prototype plasma reformer system integrated with gas turbine combustors to allow turndown ratios of 5:1 to 10:1. The work funded in Phase I of this program showed for the first time that a plasma assisted reformer using a non-thermal plasma (Plasmatron) can be operated successfully under pressure at particle number densities typical of those in industrial turbine combustors. A device was designed and successfully tested to demonstrate hydrogen yields that approached chemical equilibrium values. Modelling of the Plasmatron indicated that it may be possible to further improve the performance of the device, to be carried out in Phase II. Furthermore, chemical kinetics calculations showed that significant improvements in gas turbine turndown can be achieved by using a Plasmatron reforming only part of the fuel flow of a gas turbine. For a 5MWe turbine, this results in Plasmatron flowrates similar to the ones demonstrated in this program. No scale up would be needed. In Phase II, we are planning to integrate the Plasmatron with a gas turbine combustor, so that it can seamlessly be installed in existing power plants as a retrofit. For that purpose, we will first further optimize plasmatron design through simulation and experimental testing. Subsequently, we will simulate its integration with a gas turbine combustor fuel nozzle and test it in a flow bench. We also investigated the business case of the technology. The savings for the turbine operator come from decreasing power generation during times when the price of electricity is below cost. The turbine operators do not turn-off the turbines during those times because of life-time fatigue and restarting issues. By operating at lower power, the costs to the operator are substantially reduced (USD 17Million annual savings for a 580MW plant). It was concluded that with a payback of less than a year and several billion dollars in annual savings for the US Combined cycle market, the technology looks very promising from a commercialization perspective. For Phase II, we have demonstrated interest from Solar Turbines, a division of Caterpillar to work with us on integrating the Plasmatron with their combustors and potentially testing it on their rigs in Phase IIB (letter of support attached). For Phase III, we would work with a powerplant operator to pilot the technology as a retrofit on one of their plants and explore licensing terms. In summary, we achieved all the goals for the Phase I proposal. Phase II is needed to make the technology ready for testing in a turbine. The economic benefits of the technology are significant and near term. With the help of our industrial partner, Solar Turbines, we are well positioned for commercialization and having an impact."

        "abstract": "Geothermal heat pumps have the potential to significantly reduce residential and commercial energy usage for space heating, air conditioning, and hot water. The largest barrier to wider adoption of this technology is the high installation cost relative to conventional air conditioners, gas furnaces, and heat pumps. The high cost of geothermal heat pumps is due to the high cost of the ground loop and the increased cost of the heat pump relative to traditional air-coupled technology. A novel heat exchanger technology will be developed that increases the efficiency of the system while reducing cost. This heat exchanger technology will couple the heat pump to the ground loop, and is a key component influencing the cost and performance of both systems. A first-generation prototype of the heat exchanger design was designed and fabricated. Testing demonstrated that it outperforms a state-of-the-art baseline heat exchanger, exceeding the Phase I performance objectives while using low-cost materials and fabrication techniques. The heat exchanger development will be completed, including improving the design\u2019s thermal performance and manufacturability, scaling the technology, and fabricating prototypes of the final design. The prototypes will be benchmarked against state-of-the-art baseline heat exchangers in laboratory testing and in an instrumented geothermal heat pump. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: This heat exchanger will reduce the cost of geothermal heat pumps, improving the market penetrationof this technology and reducing energy usage of space heating and air conditioning systems. In addition, the lower cost and improved performance will make it attractive in a number of other applications, including data centers, cogeneration systems, solar thermal systems, and food processing."

        "abstract": "Implementing wireless technologies in nuclear power plants plays a key role in reducing operating and maintenance costs by facilitating a more mobile workforce and enabling wireless equipment condition monitoring for predictive maintenance. However, there are multiple barriers that impede widespread implementation of wireless technologies in the nuclear power industry including electromagnetic and radio frequency interference issues, costs associated with installing and maintaining wireless infrastructure, and a lack of commercially available wireless sensors for equipment condition monitoring suitable for a nuclear power plant. The proposed research and development effort will include hands-on laboratory experiments to establish the technical basis for the implementation of distributed antenna systems in nuclear power plants. The distributed antenna system uses a \u201cleaky\u201d or radiating cable to provide wireless signal coverage throughout a nuclear facility that also accommodate a wide range of frequencies and wireless protocols simultaneously using a single cable. The Phase I project demonstrated the feasibility of implementing distributed antenna systems in nuclear power plants by: 1) characterizing the radio frequency performance of several types of radiating cables, 2) identifying the electromagnetic and radio frequency interference risks associated with using a radiating cables near sensitive plant equipment, 3) verifying transmission reliability of wireless sensor data over a distributed antenna system, and 4) using software-defined radios to establish a communication link over a distributed antenna system. The goal of the Phase II project is to identify the optimal system components and installation practices that should be used when implementing a distributed antenna system in a nuclear power plant with the goal of maximizing coverage and performance, minimizing electromagnetic and radio frequency interference, and addressing wireless coexistence and other installation considerations. The research will also develop wireless sensor technologies that meet the needs of the nuclear industry for equipment condition monitoring using commercial wireless transmitters. COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS AND OTHER BENEFITS: The implementation of a distributed antenna system as a backbone for wireless communications will not only save nuclear power plants millions of dollars in reduced equipment and installation costs, but will also enhance communication and data access throughout the entire plant. The proposing firm will offer distributed antenna system implementation services as well as products capable of communicating wireless sensor data over the distributed antenna system. This technology is cross-cutting and benefits both the existing fleet of nuclear facilities and new reactors including small modular reactors and advanced designs."

        "abstract": "The accumulation of dirt on solar panels, also referred to as soiling, is the greatest avoidable performance loss in photovoltaic systems. Soiling comes from many anthropogenic and natural sources making it difficult to develop a standard model for accumulation across all photovoltaic systems operating today. The industry is in need of a cost effective device that will allow this key metric to be managed in a way that optimizes performance for the life of the system. The soiling problem can be addressed by installing a device adjacent to the photovoltaic array that measures a new metric called the soiling rate. The soiling rate is found by comparing a reference cell that is cleaned daily with another reference cell that is left to naturally collect dirt, dust, or other obstructing matter. The soiling rate is used in a simple algorithm that determines the most economical day to wash the array. Prototypes of this device have been installed at sites and have proven to optimize array performance when the array is washed at the calculated wash date, or in some cases, when a wash is not needed. The primary technical objective of Phase II is to make improvements to the soiling station developed in Phase I and commercialize our product. We will develop and test several new key features in the ARES device hardware and ARES Wash Extension (a peripheral). We will also develop new integrations and implement an advanced wash algorithm to the Fracsun web portal. By specifying technical objectives for both the hardware (ARES) and software (web portal), we plan to develop more than just a device that is installed next to an array - we plan to develop an entire soiling measurement solution. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: Future commercial applications of generating this data are plentiful. Upon completion of Phase II development will be concluded on a soiling database that serves to complement existing solar resource databases (TMY, NSRDB, SolarGIS, Meteonorm, etc.). This will aid the entire solar community in providing daily average soiling rates for locations all over the country and globe. This data will help financiers fine-tune cash flow analysis of potential projects, support project developers by improving production estimates for potential customers and more. Phase III of this work will seek to develop a platform that enables automatic cleaning crew dispatch. This will be driven through channel partners acting as regional operators all over the country and following scheduling instruction that is driven by local measurements on site. Using this method, soiling loss performance guarantees can be implemented into Energy Output Guarantees to ensure photovoltaic plants under this program are operated and maintained at their maximum available performance."

        "abstract": "The detection of individual charged particles, photons and neutrons and estimation of their properties, momentum and direction of arrival is the basis for a wide range of scientific and commercial applications from high-energy, nuclear and astro-physics to medical imaging and diagnosis. We are targeting the data acquisition market for medium to large size scientific experiments in High Energy Physics, Nuclear Physics and Astrophysics. These complex experiments require recording channels capable of fast data acquisition and signal processing. Furthermore, they need very long data buffers and resilience to hostile radiation environment. Rapid processing allows timing resolutions of few picosecond, translating into highly accurate estimation of charged particles and their tracks. This mandates design and development of custom electronic equipment to highly integrate functionality and performance and bring the cost per channel down. Especially, next generation HEP experiments require accuracy at or below 5 ps, resilience to radiation and very long buffering capability. We propose to design and make commercially available the \u201cAARDVARC\u201d: an highly integrated, high density System-on-a- Chip capableof state of the art waveform sampling, self-calibration, integrated readout and signal processing capabilities. The AARDVARC device will also have self-test, calibration and monitoring circuitryin addition to a deep sampling buffer making it suitable for large High Energy Physics experiments with potentially long trigger delays. Design, development and fabrication of the a first revision AARDVARC System-on-a-chip based on existing waveform sampling chips by integrating in 130 nm technology a waveform digitizer, autonomous control, digital readout, self-triggering. Test, design and fabrication of multiple revisions of the AARDVARC chip. The final outcome will be a fully tested and tuned 8 or 16 channels waveform sampler capable of self-calibration, radiation damage control, operating at or in excess of 10 billions of samples per second and with the timing accuracy of 5 picoseconds. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: This device can be used by scientists in high energy and nuclear physics experiments for fast analog data acquisition. Also, it has applications in general purpose instrumentations and medical\/PET imaging, possibly bundled with sensing devices (photomultipliers). We anticipate to be able to sell the device as an OEM manufacturer, provide associated design services or license it to a larger device manufacturer. The low cost and low power nature of the design which will give us a competitive edge."

        "abstract": "Upcoming HEP projects require physical and electrical bonds between opposite points of thin parallel circuit faces which areless than 50 microns in pitch, but current methods, such as bump-soldering and anisotropic conductive adhesives (ACA) and films (ACF) cannot reach these resolution limits and furthermore require heat and pressure that damage delicate circuitry. SunRay ZTACH\u2122 is an anisotropic conductive adhesive that, in a magnetic field, self-assembles into columns of sub-micron ferromagnetic particles that connect opposing circuit faces and which can be cured at low temperature or even ultraviolet light while requiring no pressure, but rather creating protective structural support between the circuits. During Phase I, SunRay Scientific partnered with Stanford SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory and Rochester Institute of Technology to fabricate wafers with a range of features and connection radii, assemble the fabricated devices using ZTACH\u2122, and conduct electrical and reliability testing SLAC was responsible for fabricating the wafers and performing conduction and resistance tests across the connections. SunRay Scientific was responsible for the assembly of the devices and researchers at the Rochester Institute of Technology performed sheer tests and temperature-humidity tests upon the samples and quantified the internal structure of the conductive columns using electron microscopy. Phase II research will build upon the Phase I results by refining the proof-of-principle success at greater than 100\u00b5m pitch and pursuing those methods to achieve 50 \u00b5m pitch and lower. During the process developments, material development and reliability studies, the team will ensure compatibility with damage modes specifically related to HEP environments. The final goal is to scale production volume to a rate sufficient to support Phase III prototype orders from customers we have identified during Phase I. Phase III benefits of a commercial product include environmentally-friendly manufacturing, smaller\/cheaper\/faster electrical devices, new classes of products, healthcare innovations, lighter aeronautic and space equipment, and employment opportunities for new technology and research fields."

        "abstract": "Near-field scanning optical microscopy (NSOM) is a powerful and unique approach to characterize the chemical, physical and potentially biochemical properties of materials with the nanometer scale resolution in real-time. A key element for NSOM systems that combine optical spectroscopy with scanning probe microscopy, is the actual probe itself. While many commercial vendors offer off-the-shelf metal-coated tips, only one in ten tips offers enough field enhancement to start performing spectroscopic measurements. There is a critical need for the development of reliable, efficient, and broadband near-field probes. Statement of How this Problem or Situation is Being Addressed: Optical transformer based \u201ccampanile\u201d near-field probe has been proven to show superior spatial resolution and optical throughput, and eliminate unwanted background signals. aBeam Technologies Inc. in collaboration with Molecular Foundry at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), proposes to develop a novel hybrid plasmonic and photonic near-field probes, expanding from the previous campanile architecture to boost the optical performance. Manufacturing technology will be based on low-cost and high throughput nanoimprint lithography directly onto the facets of the fiber, to ensure that the probes will be reasonably priced. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: The fundamental spatial resolution for optical based techniques is limited to a few hundred nanometers due to the diffraction limit and is not suitable to probe and distinguish spatially varying properties of matter at the nanometer scale. This revolutionary imaging tool will circumvent this limitation and will be used in a broad range of applications including solar cells, new hard drives, and artificial proteins."

        "abstract": "A recent report by the Basic Energy Sciences Advisory Committee entitled \u201cChallenges at the Frontiers of Matter and Energy\u201d pointed to the need to better understand hierarchical and heterogeneous materials, often at the mesoscopic scale. Such structures can be studied by x-ray and neutron scattering techniques, but they do not generally yield narrow signals in momentum or energy space. The natural way to probe the structure and dynamics of such systems is in terms of the space and time dependence of density correlations within the material. While this need is partially met by Neutron Spin Echo (NSE), and by Spin Echo Small Angle Neutron Scattering (SESANS), no technique is currently able to simultaneously probe both the space and time dependence of the density-density correlation function of materials, over a wide range of length and time scales. General statement of how this problem is being addressed. We have recently developed and built a compact apparatus, which allows static spatial correlation to be measured over length scales, ranging between a few nanometers and several microns. Scattering samples can be placed in any environment, including high magnetic fields, allowing a wide range of materials and thermodynamic parameters to be studied. In its present form, the apparatus, called the double Wollaston prism, is not able to measure the time dependence of density fluctuations. A relatively simple modification to the device, which combines one or two, high-temperature-superconducting (HiTc), radio-frequency (RF) flippers and the HiTc Wollaston prisms, will allow this goal to be met. We propose to design and build a superconducting HiTc, high-frequency, resonant RF flipper for neutrons, which exceeds the currently available RF flipper technology, and would allow us to address scientific questions at the forefront of modern material science. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits By combining the ability to probe both the spatial and time dependence of density fluctuations simultaneously, within a wide range of hierarchical and disordered meso-scale materials, the proposed instrument will open new fields of material science studies. Possibilities include visualizing precipitate coarsening in metal alloys, cavity growth in fatigued metals and ceramics, as well as many aggregation and self-assembly phenomena. Applications are in petrochemicals (colloidal and aggregate dynamics), biotechnology and medicine (membranes, macromolecules), and industry (metallurgy, ceramics, polymers, electrolytes in fuel cells, magnetic sensors and memory). The device we build will exceed the capabilities of existing RF flippers and may be used to replace them on a range of existing neutron instrumentation around the world."

General statement of how this problem or situation is being addressed. Alphacore is developing multi-channel ROICs that have high performance, advanced capabilities, and are low cost compared with other ICs that serve similar functions. These chips feature low-noise, high speed, and configurable circuitry that allow them to match virtually any kind of detector in use at NP facilities. What was done in Phase I? Alphacore demonstrated the feasibility of designing and implementing multiple configurations of pre- amplifiers + analog-to-digital data converters (ADCs) which form the heart of a ROIC. Many single- and multi-channel designs have been taped out and will be ready for testing in Phase II. What is planned for Phase II? Alphacore will test the various chip configurations taped out in Phase I and use the test results to optimize the next iteration of the chips, along with adding features that will make these chips even more useful. Alphacore will collaborate with researchers at several DOE facilities to verify chip functionality and provide feedback for further improvements.

        "abstract": "Most of future oil and gas exploration and production will be moving into more challenging environments and directional drilling is an essential technique for tapping the \u201cdifficult\u201d oil and gas deposits. As the key technology that enables directional drilling, geosteering is the act of adjusting the well trajectory on the fly. The goal of geosteering is to increase production, reduce cost and minimize environmental impacts during drilling. Successful geosteering jobs depend on accurate and fast inversion techniques, which reconstruct underground structure based on well logging measurements, to keep the wellbore in a hydrocarbon pay zone. Geosteering inversion in complex underground environments is challenging. This project will provide a low-cost and high-performance solution for the geosteering inversion problem. The related research will impact DOE Office of Fossil Energy by directly addressing the mission to ensure responsible development of America\u2019s oil and gas resources. Under this proposal, Cyentech will develop a geosteering inversion and uncertainty quantification software product that provides proactive guidance for pre-job well placement planning and well trajectory adjustment while drilling. Cyentech accomplishes the above goal through hardening the advanced statistical inversion and uncertainty quantification library, QUESO, developed by DOE\u2019s Scientific Discovery through Advanced Computing (SciDAC) institute. During the Phase I project, we validated the feasibility of using QUESO to solve geosteering inversion problem, tested the scalability in both standalone and parallel computing mode, and built and tested all necessary user interface components for a commercial geosteering software product. The overall objective of Phase II project is to complete the prototype geosteering software product and conduct comprehensive tests using synthetic, laboratory, and field data from collaborating oil operators and oilfield service companies. If the project succeeds, it will lead to a commercial software product for efficient geosteering services. This product will help medium and small size independent oilfield service companies and drilling tool manufacturers of the U.S. to enter the more advanced and lucrative global directional drilling market."

        "abstract": "Neutron scattering is one of the most useful methods of studying the structure and dynamics of matter. These methods require large installations at national laboratories, such as Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and other facilities constructed or planned in the US and around the world. These facilities serve a large and diverse community of users in science and engineering, developing new materials for a wide range of applications from new pharmaceutical to energy to aerospace and defense. Neutron research facilities take a decade to build with a cost of a billion dollars. But they are largely limited by the relatively small flux of available neutrons. Therefore, the efficient use of available neutrons is the highest priority for users and designers of these facilities.\nThis project addresses the need for commercial production of neutron-focusing mirrors, a new type of device, which offers the possibility to improve the throughput of neutron instruments by an order of magnitude or more. The mirrors were first designed and produced by NASA for the needs of x-ray telescopes. Our adoption of this technology leverages a large, previous investment by NASA and Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory to benefit DOE neutron facilities.\nWe demonstrated the production of a small mirror in the Phase I. In Phase II, we will produce a set of mirrors that could be used at ORNL. By demonstrating commercial production of the optics, we will catalyze this transition into a different era in the neutron research. The Phase II project will be the stepping-stone effort in this direction, especially that there is no commercial supplier of such optics. The commercial availability of neutron focusing mirrors will bring significant, even transformative, improvements to rate-limited neutron scattering and imaging methods and enable new science. These mirrors are an example of novel optics specified in topic 8a for advanced optical components for neutron scattering instrumentation."

        "abstract": "Separations often account for a majority of process costs. This is because all traditional separation processes have inherent weaknesses that prevent the system from achieving perfect (or even near perfect in many instances) selectivity. These weaknesses result in large recycle streams and require multiple separation units in concert in order to produce a product clean enough for use or sale. An atomically-precise membrane capable of allowing passage to only certain molecules would greatly improve process economics. Systems like this could replace fractional distillation in the petroleum industry and myriad purification systems in the chemical processing and pharmaceutical industries with inexpensive, energy-efficient, atomically precise membrane systems. In Phase I we completed the synthesis and characterization of two porous channel-displaying molecules and formed membranes using a Langmuir trough. We used atomic force microscopy to determine that the membranes were one molecule thick. We also developed synthetic strategies for covalently linking channel-molecules to porous supports in order to fabricate functional membranes that can withstand process conditions. In Phase II we will scale-up the synthesis of the channel-molecules and manufacture several membranes and characterize their performance with a variety of substrate mixtures. Systems like this could replace fractional distillation in the petroleum industry and myriad purification systems in the chemical processing and pharmaceutical industries with inexpensive, ultra-low-energy consumption, atomically precise membrane systems. The commercial applications of these membranes are immense and include pharmaceuticals, hydrocarbons, and the food industry. The public will benefit from lower cost goods as a result of more efficient manufacturing processes. The public will also benefit from the reduced emissions of processes made more efficient by these membranes."

        "abstract": "Material analysis is critical to enable the production of safe and quality goods and today companies use cumbersome, time-consuming, and error-prone methods to analyze materials using expensive analytical laboratories. Companies have a pressing need to measure material properties (like chemical composition and physical properties) throughout their supply chains. This project addresses DOE\u2019s interest which is to bring the benefits of high performance computing (HPC) in manufacturing supply chains via turn-key solutions.Overall Objective and Approach: Our overall Phase I and II objective is to bring to market a cutting-edge material analysis application which produces accurate, near real-time readings. Our innovative idea and approach is to use machine learning (ML) algorithms leveraging HPC to process data gathered from handheld infrared sensors for rapid material analysis. Rapid material analysis enables companies to produce quality products safely. The confluence of HPC, ML, and handheld sensors is at the center of our innovative approach and our project will be the first one to accomplish this.Phase I R&amp;D resulted in the development of (1) ML-based calibration models for portable sensors and (2) the technology to parallelize the training of the ML models. We demonstrated the feasibility of using HPC and portable sensors to achieve 80-times calibration speedup, 10,000-times faster analysis cycle time, and 70% cost reduction (vs. legacy lab-based sensors) without a significant loss of accuracy. We also demonstrated a latency of less than 1 second per sample analysis which enables near real-time analysis and control. Our results were reviewed by (1) prospective customers who gave us validation and encouraging feedback (see support letters) and (2) industry peers who approved our results for presentation at Pittcon-2018.Phase II work will expand our Phase I models to address an extended list of requirements (like dissolution rates of tablets, counterfeit drug detection, etc.). We will also focus on overcoming challenges including adaptation of our product for in-process use, scalability, and data security. Our target is to be ready by the end of Phase II with a prototype turnkey application running on a hosted-HPC infrastructure. Commercial Applications: Our product will be used to produce better quality and safer products. Companies will potentially save millions of dollars from reductions in supply chain costs and product recalls. Prospective customers include the FDA-regulated wine &amp; spirits and pharmaceutical companies. Per FDA, companies recall thousands of food and drug products annually. Timely material analysis is key to reducing recalls. This presents us with a huge market opportunity."

        "abstract": "The Particle Flux Analytics Inc. (PFA) Multi Angle Snowake Camera (MASC) has been operating at the DOE Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Oliktok Point site since 2015, providing the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement program community with unprecedented information about hydrometeor shape, size, and fallspeed. However, no technology currently exists for completing the critically needed suite of data with hydrometeor mass, density, and precipitation rate.\nThis Phase II STTR effort will accelerate development of the Hotplate Present Weather Sensor, an advanced ground-based, self-contained, hockey-puck sized precipitation and wind sensor. The instrument basis is the nano-fabrication of a high density array of individually insulated micro-hotplates that provides a video image of cooling signatures created by winds and hydrometeor evaporation. Signal analysis yields statistics for the mass, frequency, and microstructure of individual snow and rain particles, along with precipitation rate and type, and the direction and speed of wind gusts.In Phase II Particle Flux Analytics will develop a new sensor based on advanced microelectro-mechanical sensor (MEMS) technologies for measurement of high precision measurement of precipitation, winds and turbulence. The Hotplate Present Weather Sensor is intended to be a potentially disruptive entry to the weather station market by offering an inexpensive, sophisticated, and small, automated, meteorological sensor for the weather, agricultural, insurance, military, and transportation safety sectors."

        "abstract": "Advanced modeling and simulation software, such as the Uintah Computational Framework (Uintah), has been developed in the US, through significant funding by the Department of Energy Office of Advanced Scientific Computing, but has been underutilized by US industry. We will leverage Uintah for commercial simulation of industrial flares on publicly available HPC facilities, and we will further develop a graphical user interface making this software available to operators and designers to improve combustion efficiency and reduce emissions. How this problem or situation is being addressed - The small business will collaborate with developers of Uintah as well as flare manufacturers, testing companies, and operators to improve the accuracy of flare simulations. The Uintah software will be hardened for efficient simulations of industrial flares. The small business will make the hardened Uintah Computational Framework available to industrial flare operators through a web based graphical user interface hosted by commercial servers accessing commercially available high performance computing facilities in the US. What was done in Phase I? - In phase I, the necessary components of Uintah were installed at a commercial high performance computing provider. The small business, in collaboration with the research institution, simulated operation of two industrial flares, making comparisons with available data and demonstrating accuracy over a time-frame and cost that is commercially feasible. In addition, the small business developed a basic graphical user interface to ease the setup, simulation, and post processing steps. What is planned for Phase II? - In Phase II, the small business will continue work with the research institution, a flare testing services company, an independent software consultant, and an advisory team including an original equipment manufacturer, a petrochemical and energy engineering and construction company, and a petrochemicals producer to expand the use of Uintah to multiple libraries of elevated flares and multipoint ground flares. The libraries will be implemented into the graphical user interface and linked to 2-3 commercial computing facilities. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits - The improved flare simulation capability will provide more accuracy related to combustion efficiency and emissions from flares. The software-as- a-service model for industrial flare simulations will be used to make high performance computing available to designers and users of flares to improve performance and reduce emissions in a more economical fashion than can be achieved through legacy simulation and experimentation alone."

        "abstract": "This proposal aims to develop a back-end (BE) board, the \u201cIP Access Gateway\u201d (IPAG), in a commercial PCIe form factor, and build a COTS-based Continuous-Flow Trigger and Data Acquisition system (CF-TDAQ). The system monitors and synchronizes timestamps collected with local timing, and performs the event building of\nthe data chunks from multiple detector sub-systems, front-end (FE) electronics and sensors. All FE signals are transported through optical fiber using our passive optical networks technology. Our miniature, radiation-hard on-detector FE interface modules provide the electro-optical conversion. The timing, event building,rigger\/filtering, data reconstruction, and waveform analysis is performed on commercial GPU cards receiving data from IPAGs through PCIe. Both the direct optical transport capabilities, and the IPAG\u2013GPU PCIe tandem,\nprovide a massive increase in end-to-end data bandwidth, flexibility, and scalability, at a much lower cost. Furthermore, CF-TDAQ performs continuous acquisition, and multilevel triggering and filtering capability, all implemented in software. The foundation of CF-TDAQ is a ubiquitous, passive timing synchronization\nthrough our patent-pending General Timing Synchronization protocol (GTS). From a general information theory perspective, both the signals generated by particle detectors, and the network data flowing through the network links are transmission events. Our patent-pending Continuous Asynchronous TDC timestamps any transmission event with a local time reference provided by a free-running, low cost, highly stable oscillator array (OA). Numerical processing algorithms, running on GPU, provide timestamp matching, and determine the relative, end-to-end time relationships as a polynomial correction function, that is updated during every synchronization cycle. Local timestamps are converted to a single absolute time of the experiment with picosecond accuracy. Our approach eliminates the need for a custom, costly, and failure-prone Timing and Trigger Control system (TTC). The BE IPAG board interfaces between high-bandwidth digital data links from\nFE sensors, like silicon pixel trackers (e.g. CERN\u2019s GBT) or FE ADCs, and the data network (NIC function) through embedded transceivers and high-density MTP or minipod multi-fiber connectors. Finally, the IPAG has a daughter card option which provides full waveform sampling analysis and allows for direct interfacing to analog signals generated by FE sensors. Our system has a theoretically unlimited scalability ranging up to billions of sensors and multi-Pbps aggregate input rates."

        "abstract": "Direct Internal Reforming Solid Oxide Fuel Cells require an anode material with good catalytic reforming and electrochemical reactivity. Although the current state-of-the-art solid oxide fuel cell anode consisting of nickel and yttrium-stabilized zirconia (Ni-YSZ) has excellent catalytic properties and stability for the H2 oxidation at the usual operation conditions, the use of Ni-YSZ anode with carbon containing fuels results in the deposition of large quantities of carbon on the nickel surface, resulting in a marked irreversible reduction of cell performance. Our approach is to replace Ni with a predominantly single phase multi-principal element alloy. Multi- principal element alloys (MPEAs) are a new alloy development strategy, where the base alloy has significant atom fractions of several elements. We propose to combine 3-5 elements to form a MPEA and make cermet with YSZ for the anode. In Phase I, we performed thermodynamic calculations to determine composition ranges for solid-solution alloys using 3-5 elements selected from their catalytic properties and potential for coking resistance. Selected alloys were fabricated and composited with YSZ to form MPEA-YSZ anode by both powder processing and magnetron sputtering methods. CH4-steam reforming tests showed that the reforming rate on MPEA-YSZ remains lower than on conventional Ni-YSZ as proposed during tests performed at 750\u00b0C. Carbon formation was not observed in post-test MPEA-YSZ by scanning electron microscopy - energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) and Raman spectroscopy. In Phase II, we will develop electrochemical and thermal models of the cell in its stack environment for selected MPEA compositions, which can provide the basis for tailoring the anode composition. Electrochemical testing and performance analysis will be done on button cells fabricated using the optimized composition of selected alloys and compared with the performance of the base line cell. Further testing will be performed with gas mixtures more representative of natural gas to avoid the need for a supplemental conventional pre-reformer."

        "abstract": "In recent decades, High Performance Computing (HPC) has risen as one of the key enablers of innovation in science and engineering. However, complexity and cost of deploying applications impedes industrial adoption. Problems include the quality, speed, and flexibility of software tools and the specialized expertise required to adapt solutions given the profusion of hardware configurations. Efficient data reading and writing (I\/O) remain a key bottleneck in standard approaches, often limiting the scalability of application codes, reducing the scale and scope of problems that can be addressed with simulation. How the problem is begin addressed: This SBIR\/STTR Phase II will support the deployment of PIDX, a high-performance parallel I\/O library, which scales efficiently to a million cores on DoE flagship HPC systems. The key innovation enabling high-performance I\/O is a proprietary hierarchical space-filling data layout that delivers optimal performance for memory hierarchies. PIDX and the ViSUS framework enables fast visualization and analysis, even for petabytes of data stored on remote systems. This SBIR\/STTR will make this technology accessible for commercial use by reducing the time and complexity of installing and using the PIDX library and ViSUS framework. Phase I results and Phase II course of action: Phase I hardening and deploying the PIDX library in the Uintah project resulted in reducing the I\/O cost from 49% to 2% of the compute time, effectively dou- bling scientific productivity. With a very conservative estimate of just 2 cents per core compute hour, this simulation was completed with over $3M in savings for the DOE, already returning more than double the investment costs for the proposed Phase II SBIR\/STTR grant. This SBIR\/STTR Phase II will continue to harden the existing PIDX library and deploy performance improvements. The PIDX library will be lever- aged to enhance post-simulation analysis and visualization workflows. Finally, the breadth of simulations accelerated by PIDX will be expanded by developing support for adaptive resolution meshes. Commercial impact and societal benefit: A simple and efficient I\/O ecosystem is a prerequisite component of engineering and industrial use of HPC systems. Removing I\/O bottleneck will enable more efficient use of expensive HPC resources, allow larger and higher-fidelity simulations for more accurate modeling, and reduce the cost and complexity of writing scaling simulation codes. The data addressed by this project is already being produced and utilized commercially in reservoir simulations in oil and gas exploration, fluid dynamics studies in aerospace industries, and computational electromagnetics in manufacturing processes. The industrial HPC market saw a 10% growth in the first quarter of 2015, which is further expected to expand as additional applications are adopted. The I\/O library supported by this SBIR\/STTR will furthermore ease the burden of scaling, as today\u2019s scientific research capacity runs become tomorrow\u2019s commercial capability processing."

The Congruent Matching Cells (CMC) algorithm and its associated CMF, CMPS, and CMX methods have been developed by NIST yet do not appear in any commercially available software. As requested in the call for proposals, we will implement the algorithms in the C++ programming language, we will validate their performance, we will develop similarity visualization modes, and we will develop a statistical scoring model. Across all aims we will evaluate performance using what is to our knowledge the largest set of 3D surface topography data of firearms evidence. The result of this Phase II work will be a great enhancement of our TopMatch software which implements import, visualization, masking, database, and search functionality. Most importantly the TopMatch software is already deployed and in use at a number of crime labs. Therefore, the NIST methods would get immediate distribution. Overall, we will advance the NIST developed CMC-Family of methods with realworld testing and will incorporate these methods into TopMatch, a fully functional software application that has already been deployed to crime labs."

        "abstract": "This Phase II SBIR project will continue the development of an optical sorter that will be used to estimate drop sizes in sprays. The optical sorter will determine the size of drops in the 0.1 to 10 microns range. Drops in this size range are prevalent in the automobile industry, where the fuel injection pressures have increased tremendously over the past two decades. These newer injectors provide higher fuel efficiency and lower pollutant emissions. However, their continued development is hampered by the lack of a drop sizer to validate numerical models of the spray generation.The feasibility of estimating drop sizes using the optical sorter was demonstrated during the Phase I project. The primary objective of the Phase II work is to develop a prototype drop sizer for the automotive industry. The four tasks that are required to achieve this objective are: 1) determine the optimal configuration for the optical sorter, 2) design and fabricate a drop sizing instrument based on the optimal configuration, 3) develop a Graphical User Interface for the prototype instrument, and 4) evaluate the prototype system under laboratory conditions. The prototype system will be provided to NIST after the validation is complete."

Phase II objectives include maturing behavioral and control definitions in reference models, integrating SysML-language reference models with software implementations, formalizing system \u2013 analysis integration, and extending the manufacturing system modeling language to express components of resource planning and scheduling problems. At the conclusion of the work we will have a software tool that we can demonstrate to potential customers and test within their production environments."

        "abstract": "During this Phase II SBIR development program, Tetramer Technologies will develop highlymonodisperse 100-nm and sub-100-nm diameter nanoparticles for use as latex size standards. Highlymonodisperse nanoparticle latexes are needed for improved calibration of electron microscopes, lightscatteringparticle sizing instruments, atomic force microscopes, and particle counters\/contamination monitors used in the semiconductor industry. Current commercial latex standard size distributions are too broad to provide the required resolution for the calibration of these systems. During Phase I, Tetramer synthesized highly-monodisperse 100-nm nanoparticles with less than 2 nm size variation and demonstrated the ability to tune the size below 100 nm, however, the sub-100-nm syntheses were not optimized. Building on the Phase I success, Tetramer will develop reproducible synthetic methods to produce highly-monodisperse sub-100-nm nanoparticles, study the stability of the produced latexes, and scale-up the process to commercially viable levels. Initially, Tetramer will develop a synthetic method to reproducibly deliver sub-100-nm nanoparticles with controlled sizes. Subsequently, Tetramer will investigate methods to produce narrower size distributions, analyzing the samples with both dynamic light scattering and scanning electron microscopy. Nanoparticles will be analyzed to determine their long-term stability as latex solutions. Finally, Tetramer will scale-up the synthetic and purification procedures and begin sampling materials to commercial partners."

This tool will use machine learning techniques that can classify files as malicious or benign as well as suggesting files for closer inspection. Built upon custom enhancements to the National Software Reference Library (NSRL), TheSieve will allow forensic investigators to spend theirvaluable time examining the most significant files. An important application of data repositories, like those in the NSRL, is a system that associates NSRL hash values with additional information derived through static and dynamic analysis. Phase I will yield a prototype web service and application delivered with integrations into at least one forensic analysis software package. TheSieve will be used in a controlled case study to determine if searching and provided suggestions can reduce the amount of time spent identifying files. Time permitting, the prototype will improve file suggestions using machine learning. We do not believe that TheSieve can replace endpoint detection and response products (EDR), instead it will augment them by applying Big Data analysis techniques. Finally, we will develop a process by which TheSieve database can be improved with an analyst feedback loop to enhance previously seen queries."

However, NIST\u2019s CSAT needs further improvement and implementation of new functions such that it can be commercialized as an enterprise tool. In this project, InfoBeyond advocates the development of a user\u2010friendly, efficient, reliable, and generic CSAT Tool. Our CSAT will be delivered as a tool: (i) an Enterprise CSAT standalone version (Phase I), and (ii) a CSRC Cloud version (Phase II). Specifically, our CSAT overcomes the NIST\u2019s CSAT limitations such as failing FIPS policy due to outdated MS internal configuration, insecure software architecture, requiring MS Excel for report generation and database repopulation, and running single operating platform. Further, our CSRC implements new features, such as additional SP 800 series data for risk management, technical user credential management service, and built\u2010in database editor. All these improvements or new features facilitate government agencies\u2019 adoption of secure cloud solution effectively through friendly GUI. For CSAT efficiency, our CSAT is implemented in an MVC software framework to achieve enterprise\u2010level runtime performance with scalability for many users."

The silicon nanowires\u2019 high surface area to volume ratio makes them sensitive to the environment around them and can thus lead to high sensitivity detection. Each of the nanowires can be functionalized to be sensitive to either specific DNA or proteins. For Phase 1 of this SBIR, we will apply our already demonstrated biosensor to monitoring HCPs in biomanufacturing. In particular, we will functionalize our silicon nanowires to be sensitive to Escherichia coli (E. coli) HCPs. As a first step we will measure a conglomerate of HCPs that are present in potential product, but eventually we will separate the antibodies and measure each protein in a separate sub-sensor."

        "abstract": "In this SBIR effort, Nikira Labs Inc. proposes to develop a compact Raman fiber optic probe with inline spectral filtering that improves fiber-coupled Raman measurements by filtering out Raman scattering from the excitation fiber and elastically scattered laser light from the collection fibers. The technology will enable compact fiber probes for Raman studies and complement existing NIST Raman spectroscopy efforts including tissue studies and broadband coherent anti-stokes Raman scattering. In Phase I, we will demonstrate technical feasibility by fabricating a set of Raman probes that include a central excitation fiber surrounded by collection fibers. A custom, dielectric coating will be deposited on the face of the excitation fiber to serve as a bandpass filter and remove wavelengths generated by inelastic Raman scattering within the fiber. Likewise, dielectric coatings will be deposited on the collection fiber faces to reject elastically scattered laser light and only pass Raman signal. The fibers will be integrated into a probe assembly and extensively tested on Raman standards, highly scattering compounds, and a phantom tissue sample. Contingent on availability, one probe may be delivered to NIST for testing in their Raman systems. Finally, the Phase I results will be used to design a Phase II system."

We tested the robustness of the approach on thousands of test cases from NIST\u2019s Juliet test suite. In Phase II, we will extend the approach to a broader set of bug classes and improve the bug characterization methods, leading towardsa commercially viable tool for automatically understanding and characterizing software vulnerabilities. By automatically finding software flaws and characterizing them within the BF, ISABEL will help organizations improve their software quality, detecting flaws before they are deployed, and helping rapidly prioritize them for remediation."

After extensive testing of each imaging modality, the final, fully-documented instrument will be delivered to the NIST Cell Systems Science Group where it will be used to study live stem cell growth and dynamics as part of the emerging field of stem cell therapy, with eventual application in the process control of stem cell growth lines. It will enable researchers to scan 12 well plates in under 15 minutes. Additionally, it will allow for higher power objectives to provide imaging of individual cells without being limited by the working distance of the objective."

However, the complex mathematical formulation of \u201cbig data analytics\u201d is difficult to populate in general manufacturing plants. There is a need for an SPC-like tool to enable the acceptance of the advanced data analytics and its visualization. The MD Compiler, a tool to bridge the gap between data available and the information demanded by the users, is proposed. It will employ a hierarchical approach along with machine learning to complement the knowledge of the process so that the manufacturing data streams generate the informative process indexes that can be formulated quickly and presented to the operators for the illustration of the intended process attribute(s) and\/or causal relations. The innovation of this SBIR proposal consists of the integration of the industrial process\/product states into the data pipeline and applying unsupervised machine learning to automate the \u201cmapping\u201d processes in the analytics along with the concept of process snapshots. The MD Compiler, once developed, is expected to be a software package with functional modules that can take in the source data and automatically compile the data into informative process indexes for presentation with computing and data acquisition hardware support."

        "abstract": "Network measurement is a critical element in networks but it has largely been an afterthought and inadequately secured. With the emergence of Information-Centric Networking technologies, specifically the popular open source Named-Data Networking (NDN), there is the early stage opportunity to create a useful and flexible network measurement system that can accommodate a range of network probes. This proposal\u2019s objective is development of a prototype distributed Network Measurement System (NMS) that leverages the NDN architecture to ensure privacy of data and role-based authorization of entities in the NMS. The NMS can be deployed in devices with an NDN Forwarding Daemon (NFD) within an all-NDN network or as an overlay measurement system in an IP network. NDN-specific performance probes will be developed. Collaboration with NIST personnel is desired to achieve maximum impact."

The Phase I prototype will feature zone nodes and a master controller. The zone nodes will measure and wirelessly report environmental conditions to the central controller, and modulate a damper based on commands received from the master controller. The master controller will be capable of receiving information from the zone nodes, interpreting said information via on board logic and control loops, wirelessly issuing commands to individual zone nodes, and interfacing with an installed HVAC system. The master controller will feature a graphical user interface which will provide the user with a visual representation of zone node sensor readings. The master controller will also feature a commissioning and installation feature which will allow the installer to name zones and configure system settings per ACCA Manual J room-by-room calculations."

        "abstract": "This project will develop a new scientific instrument optimized for the advanced characterization of near-infrared fluorescent nanoparticles that can exist as left- or right-handed structures (enantiomers). Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are currently the leading example of such nanomaterials. Applied NanoFluorescence, LLC (ANF) proposes a novel multi-mode chiroptical spectrometer that can distinguish left and right enantiomers through their differing interactions with circularly polarized light. The proposed instrument will offer four complementary measurement modes. These modes are (1) fluorescence-detected circular dichroism (FDCD) spectra with visible excitation (400-700 nm) and near-infrared emission (900-1600 nm); (2) rapid excitationemission fluorimetry covering the same visible excitation and near-infrared emission ranges; (3) direct nearinfrared circular dichroism absorption spectra; and (4) normal near-infrared absorption spectra. Unlike existing FDCD instruments, mode (1) will offer spectral selection of the emission wavelength, thus allowing structurespecific measurements of CD spectra in unsorted SWCNT samples. Mode (2) will measure full excitation-emission maps with peak signal-to-noise ratios above 100 in less than 2 minutes. All four measurement modes will be performed under computer control. The combined results will offer powerful analyses of complex nanoparticle samples and their coatings, guiding production, processing, and application development."

        "abstract": "A dual plane Compton imager prototype system with large volume pixelated CZT detectors will be built for spectrally resolved MeV gamma ray tomographic applications. These two planes will be operated at independent clocks and they will be synchronized via a common periodical pulse. The common periodical pulse is self-generated so it does not rely on external pulse generator. Each detector will be coupled with an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC). The ASIC will convert the gamma ray energy detected by the CZT detectors to a voltage signal. An in-house developed readout and processing electronics will translate the voltage signal to corresponding location and energy deposition information of each gamma ray interaction. This information will be used by 3D Compton imaging reconstruction algorithm to create a 3D map of the material of interest inside the under-test object. In order to achieve the best imaging performance for this application, various detector position configurations and reconstruction algorithms will be evaluated. The final prototype system with optimal reconstruction algorithm will be tested by resolving phantoms with different hydrogen mass concentration."

        "abstract": "Additive manufacturing (AM) is a promising manufacturing technique for end-use parts that can solve challenges for American manufacturers in many industries, e.g. aerospace, defense, automotive, energy, and healthcare. However, despite the potential that AM offers, the rate of AM adoption in industry is very slow. This is because AM suffers from low repeatability and quality consistency issues, which lead to high cost and time requirements in AM qualification. Conventional manufacturing is mature enough such that there are commercially available engineering software and data analytics tools (e.g. injection molding simulation, casting simulation, finite element analysis) that elucidate Parameter-Structure-Property (PSP) relationships. Unfortunately, in the AM industry, these engineering software tools are barely nascent and not fully validated for AM, and appropriate data analytics tools for understanding PSP relationships do not exist. Furthermore, the database schema that holds and structures the data upon which AM engineering software tools draw is not standardized for AM data. Senvol proposes to develop a robust AM data schema that will be able to structure multiple types of AM data, including in-situ monitoring data, microstructure data and non-destructive testing (NDT) data; and to further develop a data analytics software tool that will analyze AM\u2019s PSP relationships."

        "abstract": "Wargaming plays a critical role in the modern military, both as a decision support tool for command and control centers and as a training tool for developing the future force. In both of these applications it is valuable to have access to highly skilled automated actors. In a decision support context, this facilitates fast, high fidelity simulations with a variety of possible battlefield conditions. In a training context, this supports interactive learning tools and allows commanders to hone their skills through competition with difficult opponents.Historically, Artificial Intelligence agents that can match or beat expert human performance have been limited to turn-based games. However, due to the success of IBMs Deep Blue system at Chess, and more recently, DeepMinds AlphaGo system at Go, the latest research has begun to investigate if the techniques employed by these systems can be improved to achieve expert-level performance at less well-defined, real-time games.To manage the fundamental complexities that military-domain AI systems face, DECISIVE ANALYTICS Corporation proposes the Framework for Intelligent Simulation Command with Hierarchically Embedded Reinforcement Learning (FISCHER). FISCHER will leverage the latest developments in Game Theory and Reinforcement Learning to provide a wargaming artificial intelligence that can perform at a humanlike level."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is to make significant contributions to the future of thermal environmental conditioning in buildings throughout the world. The connected, low power, wearable personal comfort systems can provide relief for the thermally-underserved of America&apos;s workforce (who are disproportionately female or part of the aging population), thereby improving their workplace wellbeing, satisfaction, and productivity. The personal comfort system could increase worker productivity by 2-3%, unlocking $17B economic output that is currently lost due to thermal discomfort in the United States, and could reduce the cost of space heating\/cooling buildings by 20-30% when integrated into smart building systems. As roughly 10% of the world&apos;s energy is spent heating and cooling the interiors of commercial buildings, this technology can make an impactful contribution to the preservation of our planet and the wellbeing of future generations. The proposed project will support the development and demonstration of a connected, low-power wearable personal comfort system that provides personalized thermal comfort to building occupants. Americans spend over 90% of their time indoors, buildings are responsible for about 40% of our total energy consumption, and yet over 40% of people in office buildings are dissatisfied with their thermal environments. The proposed project has the potential to correct this imbalance, improving occupant comfort and productivity while reducing the energy consumed by buildings. In Phase I, we demonstrated a connected, wearable personal comfort system that can improve the perceived environmental temperature by over +\/-6 degF using only 1-2 W of power. In order to harness this enormous technological potential, this Phase II R&amp;D will address remaining technical challenges around ergonomics and thermal management, intensively validate the efficacy of the devices in a laboratory setting, and culminate in deploying this technology in smart buildings and quantifying the effect on both the building and the building occupants. This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "abstract": "This STTR Phase II project will focus on the development of cost effective, high temperature molten salt heat transfer fluids for third generation concentrated solar power (CSP) plants with operating temperatures &gt;700?C. In the Phase I of this research, an additive package was developed that formed an adherent ceramic oxide coating on 316\/316L stainless steel at the temperatures &gt;700?C when added to specific chloride salt blends and inhibit corrosion. The utilization of the inhibitor package strategy will enable the utilization of economical stainless-steel alloys in the CSP plants and would reduce the infra-structure cost. Such solutions will have a direct impact on the renewable energy market which would help to lower the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) for thermal solar from the current cost of 12?\/kwh to the target 3?\/kwh by 2030. The scientific and technological insight gained in this project could be beneficial to many other applications, such as molten carbonate fuel cells, thermal energy storage systems, nuclear molten fluoride\/chloride reactors, and other high-temperature systems that are susceptible to aggressive corrosion. Incorporation of the inhibited molten chloride salt in the CSP plants will also provide sustainable green energy, reduce water usage, create more jobs and offer U.S. energy independence and security. On a societal level, impact will be achieved by the continued delivery and development of educational activities based on the research topics embodied by this work. The core innovation in this proposed program is the development of a chemical mixture, an additive package that would minimize the corrosion of stainless steel induced by molten chloride salts at temperatures &gt;700?C. The additive package reacts with the stainless steel and forms a corrosion inhibiting ceramic oxide coating in-situ when added to the molten chlorides at operating temperatures&gt;700?C. The chloride salts are proposed to be the heat transfer fluids for third generation CSP plants. The feasibility of the inhibitor package strategy in a real world CSP plant will be critically assessed in this proposed research. A prototype bench scale molten test loop will be designed and built to mimic the flow conditions in a CSP plant. The effect of prolonged exposure to high temperature molten salts on the mechanical properties of the base metal under dynamic conditions will be studied with attention to the molten salt induced degradation of strength and toughness at elevated temperatures. The degradation behavior of the salt with the inhibitor package will be studied as well. Additional research will be performed to gain fundamental insight on the nucleation and growth of the ceramic oxide coating and its thermal and mechanical stability in dynamic flow conditions.

        "abstract": "This STTR Phase II project supports standards-based math education in elementary school classrooms with a hands-on technology intervention. Research has shown that many elementary teachers suffer from low confidence and limited subject content knowledge in math and struggle to develop instruction designed to meet or exceed common core math learning goals. Teachers and researchers alike seek new approaches to engage students and improve teacher effectiveness to improve learning outcomes. The primary goal of this project is the development of a flexible, user-friendly, hands-on robotics kit with associated curriculum and support for teachers, that will engage students in learning math content, align with core curriculum, and measurably increase student achievement. The commercialization of this research-based classroom kit will enable school districts to adopt active learning into their math pedagogy. Ultimately, this promotes the NSF mission to increase national prosperity through science innovation by improving math preparation for students across the United States and preparing them to participate in careers that drive the advancement of science and technology. The core contribution of this work is composed of a flexible hardware kit to enable active learning within the core elementary curriculum as well as more traditional maker activities, and a suite of apps that allow students to use this kit to learn specific math content while also providing options to learn computational thinking through general purpose programming apps. To accomplish this, the team employs a proven design process in which hardware, software, and curriculum are simultaneously designed to align to learner goals, evaluated in classroom studies, and iteratively refined. The kit will combine the ease of use and simplicity of a regular snap-together style electronics kit with the flexibility of a programmable microcontroller. The apps developed for this project will build on a new math-based paradigm for robot programming. These math-oriented apps will remove the barrier of programming skills for elementary teachers and students alike when using the electronics kit for math instruction. Simultaneously, programming apps will enable open-ended explorations of making and computational thinking. Another contribution of this project will be the testing and analysis of the hardware system and complementary math curricula. Formative evaluation will enable exploration and understanding of novel mechanisms for learning math, and evaluation of the program&apos;s efficacy will enable characterization of the impact on student outcomes in math achievement and attitudes towards math.

Currently the national healthcare cost is estimated at $3.2 trillion. Until patients could be engaged to take ownership of their health, advancement in pharmacological interventions through medications will not be able to achieve optimal care outcomes, and the healthcare cost and utilization will remain high. Engaging patients in self-management activities that are in alignment with the motivation indicators not only improves patient experience and satisfaction, but contributes to collecting big data for linking motivation to behavioral therapy --- resulting in an effect essential to improving population health and advancing personalized precision. This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is a patient-centric engagement process MISA (Measure-Integrate-Share-Act). While well-established behavior models such as the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skill (IMB) have been reported to show clinical efficacy, the novelty of this research is the application of Structure Equation Modeling to develop a quantitative behavior model. Quantitative behavior modeling is significant because it allows a rigorous assessment of the model in terms of goodness of fit and statistical power. Furthermore, such model provides the patented SIPPA analytic engine a basis to predict the software services that are in alignment with the motivation indicators of a patient users in order to effectively engage them in self-health management of chronic conditions, and to promote behavioral change for healthy lifestyle.

The development of this new technology for efficient indoor sensing, and development of new algorithms for occupancy sensing and counting techniques, will have immediate implications in the building automation and home construction industries, where improved occupancy sensing is necessary to achieve the promise of Smart Buildings that adjust environmental conditions such as lighting and air conditioning automatically to suit the needs of the occupants. Implementing this false-alarm free technology will realize millions of dollars in cost savings from reduced energy use. Such energy savings would impact the US energy independence while helping to cut greenhouse gas emissions. In addition to &quot;smart building&quot;\/energy efficiency applications there are also significant opportunities to apply these highly-reliable and difficult-to-defeat sensors to facility security, military, law-enforcement\/correctional facilities and in-home care monitoring. This project represents Broadening Participation: As a woman-owned minority business in an underrepresented geographical location (Hawaii), the success of Adnoviv will bring opportunity for graduate students through our relationship with the University of Hawaii and encourage young girls to enter Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) related fields. This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase II project will result in a revolutionary advance in occupancy sensing for smart buildings and energy-use reduction by providing a low-cost sensor capable of real human presence detection and occupant count and eliminating the issues that have limited the utility of occupancy sensors in many applications. The feasibility of using radio frequency Doppler radar to detect human cardiopulmonary activity and estimate number of occupants using a low power system-on-chip (SoC) platform will be demonstrated. In particular, reliable occupant detection without false alarms, and occupant count estimation will be investigated to further enhance energy savings potential, especially in conjunction with heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) loads. The significant commercial potential of such True Presence Occupancy Detection Sensors in energy-saving applications will be demonstrated in partnership with one of the largest building automation companies in the world.

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this STTR Phase II project will result in significant economic activity through the utilization of waste carbon dioxide. The photo-catalytic reactors funded in the project will lead to novel methods to chemically store energy from the sun. Each year, human activity releases 38 billion tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Dimensional Energy envisions a future in which we can utilize this carbon dioxide as a feedstock for industrial production of hydrocarbon fuels and chemical intermediaries by harnessing the power of the sun. This STTR Phase II project proposes to develop HI-Light - a photo-thermo-catalytic reactor platform technology that enables the conversion of CO2 and water to synthesis gas at a rate significantly greater than the state of the art. The unique feature of the technology is that it uses embedded optical waveguides to evenly distribute light within the reactor, increasing the efficacy of the catalyst and ultimately the productivity of the system. In Phase I a fully functional integrated prototype reactor was constructed, demonstrating continuous operation, and showing productivity in terms of the grams of hydrocarbon produced per gram of catalyst per hour more than 10x greater than the state of the art. The approach solves the two major roadblocks in photo-conversion of CO2: (1) the semiconductor catalysts can only use photons with energies greater than their bandgap, which is a small fraction of those present in sunlight and (2) a large fraction of the catalyst material in these reactors is under-utilized due to sub-optimal light and reactant delivery. Our unique reactor uses a patented, multi-scale approach to enhance light and reagent transport directly to the reaction site and makes use of traditionally unused photons to provide heat and enhance reaction efficiency.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project will develop a new tool for the analysis of in situ indican precursor in indigo plants, which when combined with genomic analysis and genetic linkage mapping in selectively bred indigo crops, will lead to high indican yielding breeding parental lines and ultimately competitively price natural indigo dye. Additionally, characterization of genetic markers will accelerate further crop improvement by understanding and harnessing the genes crucial to indican synthesis and other aspects of significance to overall indigo yield. These advancements will benefit customers, denim mills, by leading to a more reliable, lower cost plant-derived indigo supply. The success of this multiphase STTR project will enable a cost-competitive, cleaner, and more sustainable denim dyeing process, while greatly expanding the market for domestically produced natural indigo. Commercialization of a more consistent and higher yielding US-grown indigo plant that produces high purity indigo powder can replace the current standard of synthetic, imported indigo powder. While in demand by the marketplace today, plant-derived indigo is currently only used in premium denim products due to the high cost per pound resulting from low yields per plant per acre. The direct result of this research will be to open new market segments and expand existing market penetration for US-grown and manufactured biobased indigo for the textile industry, an addressable market of $1.86B. The methods and technology developed through this project have a direct path to the commercial marketplace and the industry is ready to support biobased textile dyes such as plant-derived indigo. During this project, reference genome resources will be constructed for indigo feedstock crops, F1 mapping populations will be constructed for P. tinctoria, I. tinctoria, and I. suffruticosa varieties, and design of the handheld rapid assay device will be validated through laboratory analysis. The reference genome for I. suffruticosa will be built using Pacific Biosciences SMRT sequencing and assembly. In addition to this reference genome, whole-genome resequencing will be performed on available I. suffruticosa and I. tinctoria varieties. Nucleotide variation and variant effect prediction will be made between the Indigofera-based indigo varieties. This variation will be used to develop markers to evaluate intervarietal crosses. Controlled greenhouse crosses of three species will be made to create F1 mapping populations for use in constructing a genetic map and linkage mapping, in combination with the resources developed. Intraspecies varieties exhibiting distinct phenotypic traits of commercial interest or notable dye yield differences will be selected for crossing to generate the F1 populations. Results from laboratory-based fluorometry equipment will be evaluated for efficacy and then compared against extractive indigo dye analysis from the leaf biomass. A final prototype will be constructed based on these findings and validated through use in the laboratory and in the field. This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project lies in helping more amputees walk safely with less effort. There are approximately 800,000 individuals living with a major lower limb amputation, and this number is growing largely due to diabetes. For 50,000 amputees each year who need a new prosthetic knee, two options exist: learn to use a traditional prosthetic knee or attempt to obtain a high-tech, computer-controlled knee. The former require the amputee learn and execute specific technique(s) to walk safely, while the latter do so automatically but cost $30,000 to $100,000 and require physical qualification, greatly limiting their availability. The novel prosthetic knee developed here offers stability automatically, regardless of amputee technique. It prevents buckling while simultaneously allowing the user to walk safely with whatever leg motions the user is able to generate. Since it requires no electronics or power, it is available to all amputees regardless of ability, and at a fraction of the cost of high-tech knees. Amputees will be able to walk farther with less effort, improving health and quality of life, and easing caregiver burden. Additionally, this design could be adapted for use in orthotic, robotic or exoskeletal systems. This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop and test a novel prosthetic knee. Funding would be used to build prototypes and conduct mechanical, analytical and destructive testing. This testing is necessary to demonstrate that the design is feasible, safe for humans, and deserving of further development with amputees. An independent engineering design review will be obtained, prototypes will then be bench tested for function in a biomechanics lab, and an independent lab will provide destructive testing to prove ultimate strength of the device for comparison against known standards. The anticipated technical results include proof that the device can support the weight of a 300lb person, and quantitative evidence that the device will afford intuitive and universally available stability to amputees through its innovative swing- and stance-phase functionality. This work would advance the knowledge of prosthetics, rehabilitation and bipedal locomotion.

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase I project is intended to develop a noninvasive, ultra-sensitive molecular detection system for Tuberculosis (TB). Although the prevalence of TB has diminished, it still remains the second leading cause of death from an infectious disease. The latest global TB report from the World Health Organization with data compiled from 205 countries put the figures at 1.5 million fatalities and 9.6 million infections annually. The proposed technology uses the nano- Plasmonic Grating (P-GRAT) properties to enhance the detection signal of the TB biomarker by more than 100X. This results in detecting concentrations in femto-gram\/milliliter range resulting in early detection and treatment. The specificity, faster results, low cost\/test and ease of use, makes this system a substantive innovation in the TB diagnostic market. The TB testing market accounts for $1.5 billion annually of which North America is the second largest in terms of generated revenue due to the higher pricing for TB detection. The proposed technology will benefit the patients with early diagnosis and provide the health care professionals with early treatment options. With all the advantages this technology has to offer, it is expected to gain a significant share in the market place and generate a revenue stream. The main limitation of the immunoassays is their inability to detect extremely small fluorescence signals that are associated with ultra-low concentrations of biomarkers. The proposed nano- Plasmonic Grating (P-GRAT) technology can overcome this limitation due to its exceptionally efficient light coupling, reduced scattering, high signal-to-noise ratio and directional excitation\/emission. As a result, a fluorescence enhancement of P-GRAT is 100X or higher compared to a glass substrates or polyurethane well plates. Such enhancements translate to ultrasensitive detection and early diagnosis. Commercial immunoassays require hours to days to achieve pg\/ml sensitivity. In comparison, P-GRAT can detect pg\/mL range concentrations in less than three hours. P-GRAT utilizes a simplified design to exclude expensive optics like laser sources, high-magnification objective lenses and filter cubes. The use of 3-D printed parts to fabricate the system and use a smartphone as the detector further reduces the cost. We intend to develop and commercialize a noninvasive, ultra-sensitive (fg\/ml) molecular detection system for Tuberculosis (TB). TB specific biomarkers Lipoarabinomannan (LAM) and Interferon gamma (IFN-g) will be detected in urine and saliva. P-GRAT is a platform technology and can easily be adapted for the ultra-sensitive detection and diagnosis of other diseases, such as Zika, Ebola, HIV and Cancer.

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase I project will study how teachers use data to improve their instruction. In response to widespread understanding that feedback is a necessary component to improvement, school districts are increasingly investing in teacher coaches to provide feedback critical for teachers. However, this is not scalable, and typically only new or underperforming teachers have access to coaching. Earshot seeks to scale and democratize some aspects of coaching so every teacher can have access to the personalized data and feedback necessary for improvement. The goal is for all teachers to maximize their potential, better engaging students in learning. Earshot has developed a cloud-based system using voice analysis to provide data about instruction. The core innovation is a machine learning process to listen to dialogue between teachers and students and analyze the quality of the educational exchange. Funding for this project would enable study of two critical questions: How does providing data about teacher behavior affect what teachers do in their classrooms? And, what kinds of resources, content, and support are necessary to help teachers improve? This research has the potential to transform the way teachers use data about their own performance and receive the necessary help to improve.

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this project is to enable real-time situational awareness in autonomous vehicles. With the global population expected to reach 9 billion by 2050 and the uncertain climate changes that create concern over the resources allocated to farming activities, precision agriculture has become the ultimate solution to increase agricultural productivity and efficiency. The proposed system, aiming to integrate aerial and terrain robotics and provide high-throughput crop imaging, will push precision agriculture to the next evolutionary stage ? fully autonomous agriculture. With the R&amp;D efforts in this project, the integrated aerial-terrain robotics and high-throughput imaging system will be ready for commercialization under the proposed sustainable business model and impact farming industries globally. Moreover, the system prototype enabled by smart and mobile docking can be readily adapted to accommodate needs in a variety of other industries, where geospatially large-scale sensing and analytics are in demand, such as transportation network monitoring, civil infrastructure and urban monitoring, logistics and freight management, and monitoring of environmental hazards. The proposed invention and its future robotic products are expected to impact all these sectors by imparting automation in terms of high-dimensional data collection and real-time analytics. This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project provides a technology leap that furnishes state-of-the-art terrain robotics with long-range and real-time situational awareness, including pre-operation reconnaissance and post-operation evaluation. A smart docking platform will be developed that provides an unlimited energy supply while serving as an ad-hoc computing engine and enables the possibility of high-throughput imaging for single plants or plant groups. Such a systematically coupled docking-imaging-computing platform is not found to date. The docking will be realized through three independent mechanisms, including kinetic sensing and calculation, low-cost stereo vision, and radar ranging; and real-time positioning algorithms based on the three mechanisms will be developed through a fail-safe data fusion process. The aerial imaging drone, charged by the docking platform, can perform two modes of imaging activities either towards conventional terrain\/field mapping or the novel 4-dimensional (4D) reconstruction proposed in this project. The reconstruction algorithms will be developed based on the fusion of the stereo data and the hyperspectral data, which produces the first-of-its kind 4D spatial-spectral models for high-throughput phenotyping.

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to develop an orthopedic device to quantify joint mobility. Millions of musculoskeletal injuries occur each year, which results in pain, swelling, and limitations in joint movement. Unfortunately, current joint mobility and ligament assessments are dependent on the clinician?s qualitative evaluation of the ?feel? of a joint, which often results in ineffective treatment. Failure to provide proper treatment delays restoration of motion, inhibits the return of prior function, and leads to lost wages and increased healthcare costs. The goal of this proposal is to develop a transformative device to quantitatively assess joint mobility of the shoulder, elbow, wrist, knee, and ankle. The aim is to take standardized clinical techniques currently performed in a qualitative manner to that of an objective and quantitative mode of assessment. Not only will this device be a first to market product, it will allow us to begin to develop the science of joint mobilization techniques. In addition, the device will accentuate the educational experience for emerging professionals via objective feedback to ?learn? to deliver consistent interventions to each patient. Thus, this device will capitalize on technology to enhance the practice of orthopedics. This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a product to quantitatively measure joint movement. Currently, joint mobility and ligament assessments are performed qualitatively (i.e., clinician evaluates the ?feel? of a joint). However, treatments must be precise to enable the return of prior function. Inappropriate treatment can delay restoration of motion, inhibit the return of prior function, and lead to lost wages and increased healthcare costs. The goal of the proposed device is to enable accurate, simple, and inexpensive measurement of the magnitude of linear translation between two joint surfaces of multiple joints. In preliminary testing, we accurately measured millimeters of motion. We now propose to develop a compact, portable prototype that represents the ?best fit? contours for the shoulder, elbow, wrist, knee, and ankle. The use of attachable dovetail interfaces designed for each joint will allow the use of the same device on a variety of joints and permit the device to be interfaced between the patient?s joint and the clinician?s hand to enable the development of standardized protocols. An immediate display of the linear translation will appear via LED. This real-time feedback will impact clinical decision-making and support consistency of techniques for efficacious treatments.

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a novel cancer targeting technology, Active Tissue Targeting via Anchored ClicK Chemistry (ATTACK), for targeted treatment of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). TNBC is a subtype of breast cancer that occurs in 10-20% of diagnosed breast cancers and is more likely to affect younger people, African Americans, Hispanics, and those with BRCA1 gene mutation. Currently, TNBC patients are mainly treated with chemotherapeutics and cannot benefit from existing targeting therapeutics due to the lack of Estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) or hormone epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her2\/neu). This project will develop the first cell labeling based targeting technology (ATTACK) for TNBC treatment. A novel unnatural sugar will be developed for cancer-specific labeling of TNBC through metabolization to insert an artificial receptor onto TNBC and then target the artificial receptor to deliver therapeutic taxanes through a specific reaction between the receptor and the taxanes-drugs. The project involves interdisciplinary combination of knowledge from chemistry, biology, materials engineering, and pharmaceutical science. The successful development of the project will afford an effective targeted therapeutic drug for TNBC patients with improved quality of life in the future. This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a novel cancer targeting technology, Active Tissue Targeting via Anchored ClicK Chemistry (ATTACK), for targeted treatment of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). ATTACK can treat untargetable cancers that do not have established cell surface receptors through cancer-specific artificial receptor insertion of de novo designed unnatural sugars and subsequent azide-Click reaction mediated targeted delivery of therapeutic drugs. Currently, TNBC patients are mainly treated with chemotherapeutics and cannot benefit from existing targeting therapeutics due to the lack of Estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) or hormone epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her2\/neu). This project will develop the first cell labeling based targeting technology (ATTACK) for TNBC treatment. Unnatural sialic acid (a type of sugar) precursors with azide will be first used for tumor-specific labeling on cell surface and subsequent targeting. Multiple taxane candidates will be synthesized and preliminary in vitro DMPK properties of the conjugates will be studied including solubility, plasma stability, liver microsome metabolization, and cytotoxic MTT assay. In vivo biodistribution and efficacy of the taxane candidates in combination with unnatural sugar labeling will also be studied in mice tumor models to validate the anti-TNBC efficacy of the drug candidates. The accomplishment of the Phase I research will enable further translational development of the novel cancer-targeting therapeutics into clinical applications. This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop customizable cell\/tissue culture platforms using a new class of 3D printable bisphenol A-free polycarbonate (BFP) materials and a rapid 3D printing system. The 3D cell culture market was valued at $683 million in 2017 with an exponential projected growth in revenue valued at $1.7 billion by 2022. The rapid growth in this sector is primarily driven by the demand for custom-made 3D cell\/tissue models that more accurately recapitulate the human in vivo biology in comparison to conventional animal models and planar cell culture systems. 3D cell\/tissue models have the potential to provide more physiologically relevant responses for the drug discovery industry which is estimated to reach $86 billion in 2022. The proposed strategy of using BFP and a fully integrated benchtop 3D printing system will facilitate the production of different cell\/tissue culture platforms on demand and enable rapid iteration of different designs to drive forward the development of more clinically relevant cell\/tissue models for a broad market in pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, and biological studies. The intellectual merit of this project lies in: (1) the development of novel 3D printable BFP materials with tunable material properties using green chemistry, and (2) the rapid 3D printing of customizable cell\/tissue culture prototypes to support various 3D cell\/tissue models. The material development will include the establishment of a reagent library and optimization of the green chemistry process. The relevant material properties such as stiffness, elasticity, optical transparency, and small molecule adsorption will be characterized and optimized. These materials will then be printed using a rapid light-based 3D printer to prototype cell\/tissue culture platforms followed by evaluation of their performance. In particular, 3D printing precision and resolution will be characterized and optimized by varying a range of fabrication parameters such as light exposure time and intensity. Next, the efficacy of the prototypes under cell culture conditions will be assessed based on device integrity, material degradation, as well as changes in mechanical and optical properties. Various cells\/tissues will also be cultured on these prototype devices to evaluate biocompatibility. These achievements will provide customized culture platforms to facilitate the engineering of more physiologically relevant in vitro models for accelerating drug discovery and biological studies in both industry and academia.

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is that it will save billions of dollars by anticipating construction delays and streamlining coordination to prevent them. Lower costs will help upgrade our nation&apos;s infrastructure, which is a critical national priority. Many construction companies strongly want a solution to indoor progress monitoring. Laser scanning is too expensive and slow, and photography services can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars for large projects and introduce logistical challenges. The proposed research would simplify the workflow for progress monitoring of interiors by automatically registering 360 degree photos and video and aligning them to building information models (BIM), providing a cheap, quick, and effective solution for daily progress monitoring. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to localize images, reconstruct 3D models, align them to floorplans or 3D BIM, and use the aligned models to provide actionable data to construction managers. A main challenge is to robustly solve for camera pose using structure-from-motion in indoor scenes that are unfinished and contain textureless and reflective surfaces. A second challenge is to automatically or semi-automatically register the models to 2D or 3D plans, made more difficult by the fact that the site is incomplete and constantly changing. A third challenge is to create interfaces that project personnel can use to perform visual inspection, progress monitoring, requests for information, and other supervision and coordination tasks. The project will investigate the use of tags (i.e., markers) to improve robustness of 3D reconstruction and to perform registration without requiring the 3D positions of tags to be known in advance. Thus, the project addresses major unsolved problems in computer vision, robotics, and their application to construction management.

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is the development of a microalgae-based commercial hydrogen production process that will surpass current or developing technologies. By 2022, the global hydrogen generation market by value is projected to reach $154.7 billion. A technology for low-cost, high purity, renewable, scalable hydrogen production will accelerate transition to a hydrogen economy, thus facilitating domestic energy independence and creating new economic opportunities. Many industries, such as the petro-chemical, chemical, and electronics industries, would benefit from low cost industrial hydrogen. Transportation and electric power generation industries also would benefit from increased fuel efficiency. Environmental benefits include replacement of fossil fuels, switching hydrogen production from natural gas to sunlight and water, and substantial reduction of harmful emissions. The goal of this project is to incorporate proprietary, metabolically engineered, photosynthetic algae in combination with recent advances in bioprocessing and hardware engineering to manufacture clean, renewable hydrogen. This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes to develop microalgae strains that generate high hydrogen yields using a novel metabolic engineering strategy. To pursue this strategy, a suitable parental strain must be developed, combining intact hydrogen production genes with improved stability of introduced genes (transgenes). Despite the availability of genetic transformation methods, transgene stability in wild type strains remains poor. This seriously limits development of commercial strains. Two algal UV mutants with greatly improved transgene stability are available, but both have impaired hydrogen production genes. The proposed investigation will assess the feasibility of creating a suitable parental strain. The objectives are: 1) determine differences between genes of the best wild type hydrogen producing strain and the UV mutants; 2) introduce candidate genes into the UV mutants to restore hydrogen production metabolism; 3) knock out candidate genes involved in transgene inactivation in the wild type strain; and 4) test the ability of the engineered strains to generate hydrogen and retain transgenes. This project will produce the desired parental strain and enable implementation of the innovative strategy for developing production strains with greatly increased hydrogen rates in the target commercial process.

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase I project will develop Natural Language Voice-Controlled Lab Assistant technology that enables students to control and interact with hands-on science lab equipment using natural language dialog. The lab assistant technology will connect with science equipment hardware, a mobile or computer app, and cloud-based software for speech recognition and data analysis. A student can perform hands-on experiments, ask questions like &quot;How high did my rocket go?&quot; or &quot;What was the force of the cart collision?&quot;, and receive audible responses based on their own experimental measurements. The lab assistant is designed for students that encompass (1) students who are blind or low vision, (2) students with disabilities affecting physical skills, (3) students that would benefit from multi-sensory learning methods as required in Individualized Education Plans (IEPs), and (4) generally students that would benefit from increased engagement in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). The broader impacts of the lab assistant technology will be to promote teaching and learning through professional development of K-12 educators in STEM, and enable broad participation of under-represented groups of people in authentic science inquiry. The proposed Lab Assistant will be the first application of state-of-the-art voice recognition technology for educational science experiments. The Lab Assistant will integrate with sensor hardware and mobile apps to enable hands-on experiments in physics, earth science, chemistry, and engineering. The intellectual merits of the Lab Assistant are (1) the development of software that can respond to a wide spectrum of natural language questions and (2) the systems integration of many cutting-edge technologies (wireless sensors, mobile apps, voice recognition software, cloud-based data analysis algorithms) into a simple user interface for science education. The voice interactions will help students overcome disabilities with traditional touch and visual technology, work more independently due to the presence of auditory help, work more effectively in groups, and gain confidence in their STEM abilities. For teachers, the Lab Assistant will provide an &quot;expert in the room&quot; to help guide the hands-on activities that they already do, and provide technical support. The Lab Assistant will be especially useful to teachers without formal science training, that nevertheless need to lead hands-on STEM activities.

The project will develop technology that enables better software for mass spectrometry, and will make mass spectrometry-based sample analysis more accessible to a broader segment of academic and industrial scientists, disrupting a $100M market. Advanced software is required to transform raw experimental data into the lists of molecules and quantities needed to create new drugs, discover diseases and increase food production. The successful completion of the aims of this proposal will enable the development of software built for the next generation of mass spectrometry, providing user-friendly, fast cloud software built on advanced, high-information algorithms. This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop novel, high-information software technology for mass spectrometry data processing. The proposed work in Phase I will provide proof-of-concept for prototype development and testing in Phase II. The research will address three critical technical hurdles that are prerequisites to prototype development: 1) A mass spectrometry data storage and retrieval architecture sufficient to handle significantly more information from the hundreds of files in a typical study, 2) cloud-optimized versions of mass spectrometry information extraction algorithms, and 3) a cloud-based model-view controller framework that overcomes web-specific challenges for mass spectrometry data processing. The goal is to allow more experiments in the same amount of time without increasing costs, identifying more molecules than existing methods from the same experiment, and detecting molecules that are less abundant and go undetected by current methods.

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this project is to enable autonomous vehicles to make risk-aware decisions at high-speed, by reasoning about the uncertain movements of the people and cars around them to anticipate risks and react defensively. This technology will make new technical approaches to safety and risk viable for the first time. It will enable autonomous cars to drive at regular speeds in dense, highly populated urban environments while reducing the likelihood of accidents - thereby resulting in faster, safer urban autonomous driving. This will increase public trust in autonomous cars and accelerate the development of a new industry which could reshape transportation, freeing people from the need to drive their own cars and increasing their free time and productivity. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a specialized processor for risk-aware motion planning for autonomous vehicles. Motion planning is a critical problem for autonomous cars, which must decide how to move through space to reach a designated goal without colliding with a static obstacle, another vehicle, or a pedestrian. Existing approaches can only construct a few plans per second, and assume that the other road-users will continue on their current trajectories. This is acceptable for highways but not for urban driving, where distances are short and other road-users can change behavior suddenly. This project aims to develop a prototype of a specialized motion planning processor that plans in milliseconds, enabling it to consider all likely future movements of other road-users to anticipate risks and react defensively. This proposal aims to evaluate the feasibility of the processor by designing a prototype, demonstrating that it results in safer driving at normal speeds in urban environments, and quantifying its performance improvements over existing solutions. This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is in the development of new technologies to manufacture personalized therapies for cancer and other diseases that are based on a patient&apos;s own cells. Such therapies have shown remarkable success in recent years, however, manufacturing these therapies is challenging because mass production techniques cannot be employed when each patient receives a unique therapy. Indeed, for therapies based on dendritic cells, which are an important part of the human immune system, there are no manufacturing systems currently available that can perform all of the required steps. This project will address this major unmet need by leveraging advanced concepts in engineering and biology to design an integrated system for cost-effective manufacturing of dendritic cell therapies. Given the large number of personalized cell-based therapies currently in clinical trials, and recently approved therapies, such a system is expected to address a major societal need and have significant commercial potential. This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a manufacturing system to cover the steps involved in the manufacturing of autologous dendritic cell therapies. Because of the low abundance of these cells in blood, dendritic cells are typically generated from blood-derived monocytes. Following differentiation of monocytes into dendritic cells, these cells are then matured and stimulated with tumor-specific antigens. These steps represent discrete unit operations that require a system capable of handling both adherent and non-adherent cell types, different reagents for each step, and the ability to transition from one step to another with minimal loss of cells. Further, all steps must be performed in a disposable single-use enclosure. In order to achieve automation and integration of these steps, the proposed system will leverage innovations in perfusion-based dendritic cell culture and novel and cost-effective bioreactor design strategies. A combination of computational modeling and rapid-prototyping techniques will be employed for rapid iteration of prototypes and testing with potential users involved in therapeutic development. Successful completion of this project will result in feasibility demonstration of an integrated manufacturing system developed with significant end user feedback.

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is the creation of a control system that enables the next generation of high capacity lithium metal batteries to replace current lithium ion battery technology. The global lithium-ion battery market is expected to grow to $67.70 billion USD by end of 2022 from $31.17 billion USD in 2016. However, lithium ion batteries cannot store sufficient energy required by the applications contributing most to that growth (i.e., electric vehicles) as demonstrated by the slow adoption within the largest battery powered product markets today. Lithium metal batteries were conceived decades ago and are capable of storing three times the energy of lithium ion batteries. Yet inherent chemical instability renders them extremely dangerous to recharge, preventing their use. This project is the next phase of work to develop a system that monitors and maintains the stability of lithium metal batteries during charging, enabling safe and reliable use by consumers, businesses, and government. The complete solution will consist of licensable hardware and software which can be tailored to specific battery powered applications, integrating with battery cells or charging systems for consumer electronics, long range electric vehicles, medical devices, and grid storage systems. This SBIR Phase I project funds the continued development of a new paradigm in battery healing: maintaining battery electrode health from the outside in. The system uses software and electronics that control surface issues on battery electrodes which otherwise cause permanent loss of capacity and life during normal use. As an important part of the overall solution being developed, the key technical hurdles addressed by this proposed SBIR project are focused on real-time electrode surface sensing and mapping capabilities and control strategies to suppress dendrites, as well as advanced characterization methods to monitor and share electrode health information with other components to ensure safety, reliability and durability of the overall energy storage system. The R&amp;D plan will include development of live mapping of electrochemically active surfaces, control software to develop an algorithm and feedback system, and machine learning to improve sensing-mapping-control strategies. The most promising set of solutions will be demonstrated and validated in an operando visualization test cell that allows observation of the formation and suppression of dendrites on lithium metal electrodes.

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is reduced levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) of offshore wind from current levels that are about twice that of onshore wind. Given the proximity of offshore wind resources to load centers along the coast, it is an attractive renewable energy source for the nation, but high costs are an impediment to widespread adoption. One way to address this is with larger turbines that can lead to lower ?balance of plant? costs, which can be as high as 65% of the total project costs of offshore wind. However, turbine rating is currently limited due to the large size and weight of the generator and the rotor, as well as infrastructure obstacles like manufacturing, transport, and assembly. The lightweight superconducting (SC) generators being developed within this project, coupled with advanced rotors already being developed by the OEM?s, could open the door to significantly larger turbine ratings and lower costs. The underlying high specific power machine technology can also help transform a number of other weight-sensitive electrical systems like hybrid electric airplanes and ship propulsion. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to disrupt the traditional risk versus benefit trade of the low Technology Readiness Level (TRL) SC technology by significantly increasing the benefits with a novel ?active magnetic shielding? concept. This design concept enables a very high operating magnetic field within the machine while eliminating the need for a yoke made of ferromagnetic steel to contain the field. The higher internal fields increase the electromagnetic torque significantly over other solutions, leading to very high power density. Additionally, the elimination of heavy iron from the magnetic circuit leads to further reduction in weight. The proposed generator design can be about half the size of currently available wind direct-drives. Efficiency is also expected to improve with the elimination of about a third of copper coils while maintaining the same current density. Available cryogenic cooling technology from the commercially successful magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) industry will be adapted and utilized in the machine to reduce many of the cryogenics related risks while maintaining high specific power.

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase I project will help advance the health and welfare of individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS) - a debilitating chronic inflammatory disease affecting nearly 1 million people in the United States. A non-invasive, wearable retinal imaging device will be developed for at-home patient use that detects changes in MS disease activity, enabling patients and their physicians to track responses to treatment and detect disease flare-ups between clinical visits. Early detection and proper treatment of MS is crucial to reducing the risk of disease progression and disability. Current practice relies on infrequent neurological and radiological exams to assess changes in disease activity and treatment efficacy. However, there is currently no way to monitor MS in real time between these visits. Research relating retinal pathology to MS processes in the brain demonstrate that retinal imaging can provide early detection of disease events, offering an alternative monitoring pathway. This device will thus help reduce increases in patient healthcare costs associated with increasing disability, and potentially impact the research and care of patients with other brain conditions that manifest in the retina, including traumatic brain injury, epilepsy, and addiction. Following FDA approval, the device will be sold to MS patients, neurologists, and researchers. This project will yield a novel retinal imaging device that uses optical coherence tomography (OCT) and fundus autofluorescence (FAF) to assess retinal biomarkers associated with MS progression. While OCT and FAF are widely-used modalities for imaging the retina, the proposed device differentiates itself from current technologies in that it is specifically designed for use by MS patients at home. This will include a ruggedized, ergonomic, and wearable design suited for those who suffer from low mobility and other symptoms that make trips to a clinic difficult. Patients will use the device briefly once a week, during which time retinal images will be automatically acquired, analyzed, and sent to a physician for remote review. As such, it will further increase engagement between patients and physicians by making patients more proactively involved in their disease management. For this project, the following objectives are planned: 1) Develop the OCT component of the device to acquire high-resolution and repeatable images of layers in a healthy tissue-mimicking phantom retina, 2) Develop the FAF component of the device, and 3) Validate the device?s ability to acquire high-resolution and repeatable images of retinal layer thicknesses and autofluorescence in post-mortem retinas from MS patients and healthy individuals.

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this project is the ability to sustainably produce more food with fewer water and energy resources. To feed nine billion people on this planet by 2050 we need to develop new systems of agriculture. Indoor agriculture has the potential to transform the way we grow and source our food, enabling locally-sourced crops at higher yields. Food crops can be grown sustainably year-round near all major urban centers if the energy and water consumption of greenhouses could be reduced. This research will lead to the creation of a suite of water management products and services for indoor farming applications thereby making indoor agriculture environmentally sustainable and economically viable. This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will commercialize a novel metal organic framework (MOF) material that enables a new class of compact, energy-efficient cooling and dehumidification systems for greenhouses. Recent discoveries at MIT have revealed a novel MOF material with unprecedented water adsorption capacity. Moreover, the MOF material may be readily synthesized from low-cost, bulk commodity chemicals. A dehumidifier operating with this material can harvest waste heat to provide optimal temperature and humidity conditions for controlled environment agriculture. To translate the MOF material from research lab into large scale production, the material must demonstrate sufficient durability under cycling conditions, be designed to afford low cost processing and be integrated into a cost-efficient climate control system that takes advantage of its unique properties. The goal of the proposed R&amp;D is to accelerate durability testing, design a process chemistry to enable low-cost manufacturing and develop system-level models to analyze lifecycle performance and cost sensitivity in an indoor farming application.

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to enable smaller businesses to participate to the chatbot revolution, by making it easier to design and deploy chatbots. The initial focus of this project is healthcare, where there is great opportunity to improve the quality and availability of patient services. The key technological innovation is the facilitation of an ecosystem of chatbot designers and agents, through the creation of novel chatbot design, collaboration and deployment tools. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will create the technology to allow chatbot designers to incorporate human agents into the logical flow of chatbots. Currently, chatbots are designed in an ad-hoc trial-and-error manner, which is infeasible for small businesses who do not have the resources to constantly refine and evaluate their chatbots. The project will also create techniques to allow human agents to be productive when taking over chatbot sessions, and allow designers to improve the logical flow of chatbots based on usage data.

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be the establishment of the analytical framework and software for a global bathymetry mapping system based upon freely available satellite imagery, three independent extraction methods, and ongoing data collection to create geospatial products for a wide range of applications.? Shallow water zones are crucial to the world?s ecology, economy, and culture. An estimated 70% of the world?s littoral zone is not mapped to modern standards, and traditional methods of mapping these areas are prohibitively expensive and dangerous. Through remote sensing techniques, this innovation will produce detailed bathymetric data for shallow water areas around the globe at far lower costs than traditional methods. This is particularly significant for impoverished remote, low-lying islands which have scarce resources for mapping the natural environment on which their economies heavily rely. ?Additionally, shallow water bathymetry data is vital to geospatial intelligence and to accurately assessing the feasibility and environmental impact of projects relating to global trade\/port development, aquaculture, tourism, and resource development.? The results of this innovation will provide a modern baseline of seabed topography for future scientific analysis, change detection, and greater understanding of the marine environment. The proposed project addresses the budgetary and health and safety challenges of nearshore bathymetry mapping by advancing three distinct methods of calculating satellite derived bathymetry. These methods rely on different parameters of measurement for water depth retrieval, enabling the advantages of one method to overcome the shortcomings of another. This will create a self-validating method for leveraging advanced remote sensing algorithms in an integrated software platform with ongoing data collection to produce 10-30m resolution bathymetry elevation models.? Extraction methods utilize underwater stereophotogrammetry from multiple overlapping images, wave kinematic detection from multispectral imagery, and measurement of variable attenuation of multispectral signals through the water column.? Research will be conducted on computer vision applications for assessing and allocating images based upon metocean and atmospheric parameters; seafloor spectral segmentation techniques and effects on subsequent multispectral depth retrieval; automation of stereophotogrammetric seafloor target identification and correlation, and integration and automation of wave kinematic derived depth values with multispectral depth retrieval values.? Statistical analysis of resulting data from this combined processing method, evaluated against in situ data for trial locations, will provide direct comparisons for accuracy reporting, algorithm refinements, computational optimization, and determine overall technical and commercial feasibility of future global implementation.?

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to increase the returns of grain storage for farmers and reduce overall postharvest loss due to toxin and insect damage. Ten billion bushels, over half of US grains, are stored on-farm each year for 3-12 months. During this period, grain is susceptible to spoilage, infestation, and moisture loss?all of which impacts the price a farmer receives at the time of market delivery. There is no easy way to monitor grain quality changes throughout the storage season to optimize for best times to run aeration controls to preserve, condition or maintain the grain. This leaves farmers with a ?gut check? system of driving to each grain bin site and climbing up and inside units. Since grain is priced based on moisture baselines, farmers are essentially selling water and weight, their final price outcome can vary significantly based on how well they managed grain conditions throughout the storage period. In the US, an annual $3 to $ 5 billion dollars (3 ? 5%) of crop value is lost due to toxin, insect and moisture mismanagement that could be prevented through the introduction of affordable and accessible monitoring technology. The proposed project would advance internet of things automation and wireless sensor applications as applied to production agriculture and the postharvest supply chain. There are certain, manual processes of farm production that are strenuous due to time burdens and the lack of obtainable information to make decisions. Monitoring grain assets, the product of farmers? toil and the safety net of global food supply, in farm bins, commercial storage, and barges is one such process. Sensing for when loss and spoilage risks occur, but more importantly connecting and turning the data into automation opportunities before they exist is the aim of this proposal. Cable-based monitoring solutions exist, but adoption is restricted due to physical installation limitations, electricity\/power constraints, and investment costs. This project will validate the feasibility of a low-power, wireless sensor that can detect grain conditions and last a full postharvest cycle (18 months). Such a device will create opportunities to track grain qualities across the agriculture value chain, beginning with its use to monitor and automate farm grain storage. By characterizing, and testing against cable systems and within grain science 3D models, this project will prove the wireless sensor?s direct functionality within this first farm application.

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to provide analytical technology that will foster the commercial development of complicated biomanufactured products. The most pressing need is to reduce the time and cost to bring the latest generation of biotherapeutic drugs to market. Currently, upwards of eight years and $1B is spent to move a candidate drug from discovery through final approval. Along the way $300M is consumed by analytical testing procedures to certify the product. The American healthcare system will benefit from new and less expensive analytical technologies that reduce certification costs and lead to less expensive drugs. Manufacturing efficiency also can be improved using the proposed technology. Biomanufactured products are harvested from cultured cells, and there are times when the culturing process fails to produce a perfect product. Detecting impurities and spoilage during manufacturing will further reduce manufacturing costs and directly benefit the consumer through the delivery of better therapeutic products and treatment regimens. This SBIR Phase I project proposes to quantify the validity of an ion mobility spectrometer as a high-throughput tool for screening conformational variation, purity, and aggregation of biotherapeutic drugs. Conformation imparts functionality to a protein and any variation in conformation implies there is a variation in biochemical activity, which is undesirable. Ion mobility is a technique that determines molecular cross-section, which in turn is a measure of a molecule&apos;s conformation. The gold standard for determining protein conformation is x-ray crystallography, a methodology limited by throughput. There is an unmet need to develop faster ways to measure protein conformation. The proposed technology determines a protein conformation rapidly across all phases of biotherapeutic drug development from discovery, expression system testing, scale up and manufacturing. Additionally, the patented design for this ion mobility spectrometer provides a way to measure changes in conformation that might result as a consequence of exposure to thermal, chemical, and photo-induced stress as needed for drug stability and developability testing. The proposed work will quantify resolution, reproducibility, accuracy, and throughput for this benchtop instrument. The evaluation will be performed using antigen-antibody pairs and several biotherapeutic drugs in collaboration with an academic group and industry partners.

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to enable accurate electronic health record (EHR)-based studies to support precision medicine. The country is embarking on a journey of using real world evidence (RWE) to adjust the existing standard of care. EHR-based subgroup analytics and comparative effectiveness studies will increasingly be used to augment regulatory and reimbursement approval. These efforts require accurately recognizing clinical outcomes in real world scenarios. Studies attempting to identify real world outcomes, such as pain and disease free survival, have shown low accuracy rates in claims and EHR discrete data. This proposal aims to accurately detect challenging outcomes from EHR data using advanced semantic technologies. The goal is to enable accurate RWE studies to achieve safer and more effective use of RWE in clinical practice. This SBIR Phase I project proposes to create an application to extract clinical outcomes from real world data to enable EHR-based pragmatic clinical trials (PCTs). The approach uses natural language processing (NLP) to dive deep into the health record for exposure, intervention, and outcome data that do not exist or are inaccurate in claims and EHR discrete data. Project objectives include extracting features from clinical data using NLP and ontologic mapping, developing a knowledge database that reflects common outcomes in observational and clinical trials, and inferring outcome from extracted features using clinical data. The project will validate the outcome detection engine using de-identified longitudinal clinical data to assess accuracy of feature extraction and inferred outcome.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project focuses on finding a practical and cost-effective protective cap for baseball pitchers susceptible to serious head injuries from impacts of batted baseballs. The new cap design satisfactorily addresses the shortcomings of previous commercialization efforts that were unable to meet the prescribed protective requirements; failed to pass both the players&apos; fashion expectations and comfort evaluation; and carried a hefty purchase price. The acceptance and use of the new cap by professional baseball players will create widespread demand from collegiate, high school and Little League players, a market that is estimated to generate annual revenues of more than $18M. These market projections exclude consideration of the technology&apos;s Broader Impact potential in other sports or vocational and military applications, where there is a growing recognition of the need for improved head protection for athletes, soldiers, law enforcement officials and construction workers. Sports injuries are now highly scrutinized, especially those causing long-term medical issues from brain injury, blunt force trauma and repetitive concussive injury. The societal value of this innovation will be found in safer sports and work environments. Such equipment represents a rapidly growing segment of the apparel market and a unique commercial opportunity for the company. The intellectual merit of this project is based on the company&apos;s patented design that provides head protection from the impact of a baseball. The novelty of the protective cap headliner is its flexible outer hard shell made with highly rigid interconnecting truncated icosahedron panels. This allows the headliner to conform to the shape of the head while maintaining the stiffness needed to diffuse impact loads. Since the impact of a baseball represents a short duration point load, the energy-absorbing capacity of the layer beneath the outer shell can be minimized. The objective is to identify the material characteristics required to dissipate the impact load associated with a Severity Index of 1200 or greater when a head-form is struck by a baseball traveling at speeds up to 125 mph; and to identify the material combination(s) best suited to achieve this goal. Traditional foam materials as well as state-of-the-art material compositions will be used in unique configurations to produce solutions that are not too heavy, not too bulky nor too hot to wear. The outcomes of this study will determine the availability of materials that can be used within the ergonomic and mechanical constraints of the patented design to protect the head.

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will be to develop a preclinical drug characterization platform capable of profiling the effect of a drug candidate on whole protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. PPIs play a pivotal role in most diseases, and are considered high-impact therapeutic targets for cancers, autoimmune diseases, infectious diseases, and more. Over 40 clinically relevant PPIs have been disrupted successfully with small molecules, and several have entered clinical trials. One recently approved cancer drug, Venetoclax, is expected to reach $2.2B in sales by 2020. Despite the enormous clinical and commercial potential of PPI disrupting drugs, preclinical characterization remains a major challenge. Pharmaceutical companies are limited by slow and laborious techniques to measure protein interactions that require each protein to be purified, and each PPI to be measured separately. As a result, only a small subset of relevant interactions are tested during preclinical drug development, which leads to a high incidence of failure during clinical trials. The proposed platform for PPI network characterization is expected to have a major commercial and societal impact by enabling more thorough preclinical screening of PPI inhibiting drugs, reducing the overall cost and time associated with drug development. This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop and commercialize a novel platform for screening PPI disrupting drugs that provides quantitative accuracy, enables simultaneous characterization of whole PPI networks, and eliminates the need for protein purification. This platform combines the throughput of a cell-based assay with the accuracy of a bioanalytical technique by linking yeast haploid mating efficiency to the affinity of proteins displayed on the cells&apos; surfaces. Preliminary results demonstrate that next generation sequencing of diploid cells may be used to accurately measure many PPI strengths simultaneously. The goal of this project is to demonstrate that the proposed platform can correctly recapitulate whole disease-relevant PPI networks and accurately characterize well-studied inhibitors in a format that is compatible with existing high-throughput screening workflows. To demonstrate feasibility, the well-studied BCL2 PPI network, which contains unstable proteins and considerable complexity, will be analyzed to identify each pairwise PPI and compared to known interactions from the literature. The yeast strains and assay parameters will then be optimized for screening water insoluble small molecule drugs and 96-well plate compatibility. The ultimate goal of this project is to establish a new platform technology for the preclinical characterization of PPI inhibiting drug candidates. This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable a safer, more reliable, and more efficient electric power grid. The power grid is critical infrastructure on which all of America&apos;s economic sectors depend, and so its reliability and stability is of the utmost importance. The technology being developed is the ideal modeling and simulation platform to analyze and predict grid abnormalities and blackouts due to its unprecedented ability to simulate complex systems accurately. Its physics-based simulation engine can incorporate more detailed models of loads on the grid, thereby allowing system operators to better assess grid state and stability. The proposed technology is also uniquely capable of modeling distributed energy resources at the transmission and distribution scale, an industry need that has been deemed critical to increase the penetration of renewables on the grid. The technology has substantial potential for commercial impact, as there are thousands of transmission, distribution, generation, and consulting organizations that are potential customers. Combined, these factors can help enable a more robust, secure grid that operates with reduced cost and emissions. This Phase I project represents the first step in making this technology a commercial reality. This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project represents a significant departure from traditional methods that are used to model the electric power grid. The team&apos;s foundational research has already shown that the technology can simulate the U.S. Eastern Interconnection (half of the U.S. transmission grid) from any initial condition to evaluate complex contingencies - capabilities that are not possible with existing tools. The current- and voltage-based formulation used in the model is more flexible than is used in traditional power systems simulation software, enabling more realistic physics- and\/or measurement-based models for more accurate simulation results. The Phase I project includes developing a secure and robust cloud platform for the technology that supports parallelized grid analyses, with a full library of component models and an intuitive web-based interface. This will enable system operators, utilities, and consultants to improve their planning studies and operations by enabling more accurate simulations at a higher throughput than is possible with today&apos;s software. The work done in Phase I will serve as a foundation for future advancements in power grid modeling and simulation, including integrated transmission and distribution system analysis and statistical analysis to assess the impact of uncertainties on the grid.

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project entails alleviation of a human eye condition that has obscured the scientific community for almost a century. Refractive eye error is the most pervasive condition affecting the ocular health of the U.S. population, across all ethnicities. Presbyopia, a widespread form of such refractive error, affects 125 million Americans, and over 1.8 billion people worldwide today. It is caused by reduction of focusing and re-focusing ability of the human eye lens with natural aging. The symptoms range from blurred vision, haziness, and eye strain to headaches, which are sometimes severe enough to affect the quality of life and work ability of subjects. Since the early 1900s, presbyopia has been traditionally treated with fixed power multi-focal and progressive eyeglasses that do not solve the core problem of age-related loss of accommodative ability. The principal goal of this SBIR work is development of key high performance tunable Smart Eyeglasses with good stability and restoration algorithms that will help restore this lost ability. This 21st century device, the world?s first smart auto-focus eyewear, will offer personalized full field normal vision restoration to presbyopic subjects and generate jobs and revenues worth billions of dollars. This SBIR Phase I project proposes to implement the feasibility of commercialization of 21st Century variable power smart eyeglasses that will restore the natural accommodation of human eye that is lost to presbyopia due to aging. These adaptive glasses use a combination of fluidic lenses with variable power, ultra-light actuators, distance sensors, and embedded control electronics to continually produce full-field sharply focused view for objects at variable distances. For this proposal, we focus on the research and development of two important aspects of these devices which are key to a successful commercialization. First, is improving the long-term stability of the viscoelastic membranes of these adaptive glasses by using low drift materials instead of PDMS, and secondly, incorporating a closed-loop feedback mechanism using displacement sensors to account for the correction of drifts resulting from the hysteresis and degradation of lens-driving piezo actuators. In the first task, our goal is to achieve an optical power drift of less than 120 milli-Diopter\/year, and in the second task, achieve a drift less than 83 milli-Diopter\/year. These milestones will result in a lens with drift that is less than 0.25 Diopter over its expected 3 year lifetime, critical for a commercial grade eyewear lens.

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase I project aims to demonstrate the technical feasibility of a first-of-its-kind injectable gel for treating osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis, a disease of the body&apos;s joints, affects greater than 27 million Americans, and the proposed activity will de-risk the proprietary gel technology to warrant continued development of a medical device for treating osteoarthritis. The product is a bioinspired polymer gel solution, to be administered by injection into the joint, which will lubricate, cushion, and protect the joint&apos;s cartilage from wear, and thereby slow the progression of osteoarthritis. Upon successful completion of this project, the company aims to complete the preclinical and clinical studies required to gain regulatory approval for the product emanating from the proposed activity. From this project, a deeper fundamental understanding of body-biomaterial interactions will be gained, benefiting engineers, clinicians, and ultimately patients. The anticipated commercial success of this product will result in job creation both before and after completion of product development. As joint pain is one of the leading causes of missed work, disability, and general depreciation of quality of life, successful completion of the proposed high-technical-risk project will lay the foundation for development of an impactful medical device which will treat the highly prevalent disease osteoarthritis. The innovation of this project&apos;s technology lies in the patented synthetic techniques and composition of a tissue-protective gel solution that remains in the joint capsule at therapeutic concentrations for significantly longer than current injectable gels remain. All injectable viscoelastics approved in the United States for treating osteoarthritis are comprised of hyaluronic acid, a biopolymer which degrades rapidly upon injection; in contrast, the product in this project uses a synthetic, bioinspired polymer which resists degradation and maintains effective viscoelastic properties for four months, whereas current products&apos; viscoelasticity is degraded after one week. The project&apos;s first objective will, through a radiolabeled biodistribution study, ascertain the gel&apos;s distribution throughout the body following injection into rodent knees, to demonstrate 100% clearance out of the animal and no accumulation within any tissues or organs. The project&apos;s second objective will develop the material processing techniques and syringe filling protocol for formulating the gel into its final product form and ensuring product performance and safety specifications are met. Completion of these objectives will allow product to be made under FDA-compliant Design Control for a pivotal large animal study to be conducted following this project, along with completion of formal biocompatibility testing for submission to FDA to seek approval for a First-in-Human clinical trial.

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercialization potential of this SBIR project is an electrochemical water treatment technology which has the potential for minimizing cost, requiring little to no maintenance, and comprehensively treating harmful contaminants such as pathogens, toxic organics, and metals in drinking water. About 80M U.S. homeowners are seeking a water purification solution for fear of their water quality. They are unsatisfied with the high maintenance, long-term costs, and lack of comprehensive treatment capabilities of existing systems. This SBIR Phase I project proposes to optimize, demonstrate, and scale an electrochemical water purification system for residential point-of-entry application. Existing water purification systems are largely ineffective in comprehensively treating contaminants such as pathogens, toxic organics, and metals, and also require frequent maintenance which contributes to high costs and waste generation. To address these concerns, the treatment effectiveness, cost, and feasibility of treating water contaminated with pathogens and toxic organic compounds by the proposed electrochemical technology will be studied in laboratory and pilot scale applications. Design parameters will be optimized for highest treatment capability and lowest costs and maintenance needs. Prototypes will be scaled for pilot evaluation at flow rates for residential point-of-entry application and evaluated for robustness. The laboratory and pilot units will be evaluated for perfluorinated compound (PFC) removal consistent with NSF\/ANSI P473 and for pathogen disinfection following EPA Purifier Standard Certification. PFC removal and disinfection are keys to proving a comprehensive water purification solution for decentralized treatment. The end result will be a small product automated by sensors that connects directly in-line with a building&apos;s plumbing.

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase I Project will productize a quantitative data processing technology in dynamic positron emission tomography (PET). Dynamic PET&apos;s distinction from its static counterpart is in the fact that it collects time-dependent tracer concentration data. It is a highly sensitive and accurate way of functional and molecular imaging of protein targets such as biomarkers of Alzheimer&apos;s disease, Parkinson&apos;s disease, or brain trauma. Unfortunately, dynamic PET is rarely used in clinic because of long imaging time and complex processing. The technology to be developed in this proposal will shorten the required imaging time and simplify the analysis, allowing for accurate and reliable imaging of disease biomarkers for aiding drug development, clinical diagnostics, and treatment monitoring. The proposed analytic workflow will be offered as a cloud-based service that can be used by the customers to analyze new or historical PET datasets. In order to overcome the established practice of relying on less accurate and informative static PET imaging, the grant recipients plan to conduct a thorough validation of the new technology using a dedicated physical phantom and human subject images acquired in the past. The largest impact of the new technology is expected in medical research and drug development. The accepted practice of analyzing dynamic PET datasets involves reconstruction of the parameters of implied compartment model describing the tracer biochemistry, which involves several accuracy-degrading approximations and requires lengthy acquisition. The alternative approach proposed in this project relies on decomposing the dynamic PET image sequences using a combination of several processing techniques that incorporate the essential features of tracer pharmacokinetics without making explicit assumptions about the model parameters or about the underlying anatomy. The key part of the proposed methodology is factor analysis of dynamic structures, a non-negative matrix decomposition technique with successful past applications in radionuclide image analysis. The result of the workflow is a 3D concentration of tissues that exhibit specific-binding of the radiotracer. In order to validate the quantitative accuracy of the approach, the researchers will build and image a dedicated physical phantom capable of producing overlapping distributions with different tracer dynamics. In order to validate the scan-time reduction claims, the new workflow will be used to analyze existing dynamic PET human subject datasets using increasingly shorter input time windows.

This is part of a growing trend towards &quot;alternative data&quot; products relying on artificial intelligence and machine learning. Besides the financial industry, there are numerous potential applications of controversy detection technology in a variety of market verticals, such as crisis management, defense applications, and advertising technology. Beyond commercial applications, there is scope for social impact by opening analysis and explanatory power of controversies to individual users. Controversies have a massive impact on civic society and the so-called &quot;filter bubble&quot; exacerbates polarization, both political and otherwise; fake news on both sides of the political spectrum has recently captured public attention and generated political concern. Positive impact on society from commercializing this technology includes helping users become better informed and more capable of critically evaluating the often-overwhelming stream of online content. Proving the feasibility of this innovation in a highly quantifiable space such as finance could answer a customer need in that space and create new jobs for the economy, while enabling social good applications that can improve civic society. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project relies on sophisticated machine learning and information retrieval techniques to automatically detect controversial topics. The initial data were collected at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, using NSF-supported research, which recognized controversy by mapping the text of a webpage to algorithmically-identified controversial topics. Research has demonstrated that controversy cannot be detected using existing methods of sentiment analysis, a widely-adopted natural language processing method. This project bridges the gap between the current capabilities of this nascent technology and the clear user need in the financial domain. It will evaluate the feasibility of controversy detection by applying a real-time controversy detection signal to financial data to reduce risk and increase returns.

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is significant as it offers a disruptive new mechanical approach to stroke treatment. Each year, 795,000 strokes occur in the U.S., 1.7 million strokes in Europe, and nearly 20.5 million strokes worldwide. This public-private partnership is expected to have an important positive societal impact on the community by saving lives especially the elderly and decreasing the economic burden of stroke on the taxpayer. This life-saving device has a unique value proposition for health-systems with lower inventory costs from a single size device, and for patients with better vessel re-opening rates, thereby saving brain cells. This textile-based braided retrievable stent, also known as an embolus retriever or thrombectomy-assist device is an innovation that will enhance scientific and technological understanding of how personalized medicine can transform the care of stroke patients in the U.S. and worldwide. This SBIR Phase I project proposes to bring to market the industry?s longest blood clot or embolus retriever for removal of short and long clots that can be customized by the operator based on each patient?s clot burden. In addition, it is the first textile-based braided retrievable stent which works well in conjunction with standard catheter-based aspiration systems for stroke treatment developed in the U.S. that can be personalized to all clot lengths. Stroke is a major problem causing 5.5 million deaths worldwide and currently there is no cost-effective and efficacious treatments. The mean lifetime healthcare cost per stroke patient is $140,048. This textile-based clot retrieval device (aka thrombectomy-assist device) is a cost-effective medical device that can help save a stroke patient?s life. The methods and approaches of this project is to compare via pre-clinical tests the ability of a textile-based medical device to re-open vessels blocked with clots compared with existing approved treatments. The goals and scope of the research will focus on the ability to rapidly re-open vessels that are blocked by clots. This paves the way for personalized medicine with a customizable stroke treatment device that can be tailored to a patient?s clot burden. This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will enable fast focusing and zoom in microscopy with an optomechanical system consisting of micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) mirrors. The microscope add-on will enable fast 3D imaging in wide-field microscopes and increase focusing and zoom speeds by 100x when compared with conventional methods in confocal and multiphoton microscopy. The technology allows the sample stage and objective lens turret to remain stationary during experiments. It will increase throughput, preserve sensitive samples, enable observation of dynamic events, and reduce training time. The innovation will spur significant discovery in understanding dynamic reactions that occur in in vivo and in vitro microscopy. The initial target market has an estimated gross revenue of $75M. The technology also promises to benefit 3D imaging systems for manufacturing or machine vision, optical coherence tomography, and endoscopic imaging systems by providing high speed and agile focus control. While MEMS are ubiquitous in mobile platforms and the automotive industry for motion sensing, they have not yet permeated other markets or imaging systems to the same extent. With recent advances in fabrication and performance of optical MEMS devices, bringing this type of technology to other platforms can spark greater commercialization of the technology in non-traditional areas. The intellectual merit of this project is foremost the demonstration of a novel optomechanical system with MEMS mirrors for independent control of focusing and zoom in microscopy. MEMS mirrors are a type of varifocus element. They remain stationary while their voltage-controlled, configurable surface shapes allow for fast focusing and attendant correction of spherical aberration. Fast MEMS mirrors, with sufficient diameters for 2x zoom and significant focusing capability, have not previously been demonstrated in literature or commercially. By producing and characterizing fast, large-diameter MEMS mirrors for this project, knowledge of varifocus elements will be advanced. This project will also continue to define standard optical design practices to best utilize varifocus elements, since traditional optical analyses assume fixed focal length lenses or mirrors. The project objectives are three-fold: 1) fabricate large-diameter MEMS mirrors with greater than 40% yield, 2) characterize their focusing range and dynamic behavior, and 3) demonstrate them in a focus and zoom system suitable as a microscopy add-on component.

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a minimally-invasive device that can be used to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) by safely injecting a proprietary substance into the base of the esophagus. GERD is the most common gastrointestinal diagnosis in the US, afflicting ~26% of adult Americans (&gt;60 million people), undermining their sleep, productivity, and quality of life, and leading to other gastrointestinal diseases. Approximately one third of GERD patients continue to suffer from symptoms despite currently available medications treatment. Moreover, long-term use of currently prescribed drugs has side effects and risks. Current surgical solutions are invasive, costly and carry significant risk. The proposed injection system is expected to enable a novel, less invasive and less costly treatment for GERD, leading to reduction of overall healthcare costs and preventing or reducing the incidence of other gastrointestinal diseases. Given the large market size for GERD and profound clinical need, this project directly addresses a critical barrier to developing such therapy for GERD patients. It has the potential to significantly improve treatment of such a common disorder, to become a standard of care and generate tax revenues and jobs. The project seeks to develop an endoscopic injection system for consistent multiple injections of bulking agent into the submucosal tissue plane in the lower esophagus. At the heart of this technology will be a novel injection system that utilizes a suction port to grasp the esophageal wall and direct a needle tip to the desired submucosal depth of the affixed tissue. The design of the needle and needle guidance system will be optimized for injection of viscous solutions and will be used for injection of a bulking agent that creates submucosal tissue bulging at the lower esophagus, ultimately preventing gastroesophageal reflux. The proposed device will be unique in its ability to accurately guide submucosal injections to the desired tissue plane. This will be the first system to use vacuum assist for targeted injections into submucosal space. Rapid iterative 3D-printing prototyping will be employed to optimize needle guide geometry and design. Repeatability of the injections with the system will be tested into multiple samples of cadaveric porcine esophagus tissue and porcine cadavers. Impleo already owns an issued US method Patent to inject bulking agent in the esophagus and plans to generate additional IP in this project.

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase I project intends to improve the outcomes of children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) by providing critical data from non-clinical settings that are currently unavailable to autism treatment providers. The project also focuses on accelerating the analysis of that data. It is estimated that the costs associated with ASD will be more than $2 million over a patient&apos;s life. However, studies have shown that the costs of lifetime care for a child diagnosed with ASD can be reduced by 2\/3 with early intervention. Designing an appropriate treatment program, and then monitoring its efficacy, requires the collection of a range of data to avoid dependence on inference and anecdotes. Treatment providers often collect detailed data while working with an individual diagnosed with ASD, but they count on parents and caregivers to provide them with data regarding the child&apos;s progress outside the clinical setting. The data submitted are usually incomplete and inadequate (if submitted at all). This SBIR Phase I project will result in a prototype that will rapidly provide autism treatment providers with critical data and analysis, reducing the amount of time it takes to design an optimal treatment program, and thereby reducing the long-term costs associated with a diagnosis of ASD. This Phase I project will result in a prototype that will make the process of logging data almost frictionless for parents. That narrative data will be combined with video data, biometric data, and additional data collected passively from external sources. All the data will be merged, and then analyzed via machine learning to locate patterns and provide a complete picture to the child&apos;s behavior analyst. Developing a camera that will be unobtrusive enough for a child with ASD to tolerate will present a challenge, as will developing the associated software to tag items within the camera&apos;s view and save only relevant clips (such as the times immediately before, during and after a meltdown). It will also be challenging to develop a wearable device that a child with ASD will tolerate, along with the associated sensors and software to track metrics associated with arousal and stress. The most significant technical challenge, however, will be to develop the software that combines the multiple data streams and outputs a standardized ABC report (Antecedent, Behavior, Consequence) that would be judged as high quality by a Board Certified Behavior Analyst.

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is the development of a cost-effective, environmental and economically sound Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) production facility based on a finite number of horseshoe crabs (HSC) using minimally impactful and novel bleeding procedures. The goal is to address the demands of an estimated $114 million LAL market and finished kit market in excess of $1 billion per annum. Success of this project also anticipates exceeding current standards by ensuring biomedical and pharmaceutical manufacturing compliance with fewer total horseshoe crabs than the number that die annually from current practices. New approaches to HSC bleeding developed in this project would also enable repeated, controlled bleeding while maintaining optimal conditions for animal vitality and for the adjacent communities. Assuming optimized, scalable HSC bleeding operations could eventually expand current supplies, innovative applications could be developed. For example, early detection of sepsis could help avert some $30 billion in direct care every year in the US, notwithstanding the potential to save countless lives with development of gram-negative screening tools for hospital acquired septicemia. This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop an alternative method of bleeding horseshoe crabs (HSCs) for Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) harvest. The overarching objective to demonstrate the proof-of-concept of an implantable, and surgical-grade device engineered to facilitate routine bleeding, without compromising the integrity and well-being of the HSC. This will be achieved via a systematic study of HSC bleeding outcomes to investigate whether such a device can meet the sterility and quality standards of traditional approaches, while obviating the need for extraneous transport to expensive, inland bleeding facilities. Furthermore, the commercial opportunity and feasibility of the device paired with a habitat-based, enclosed system to systematically monitor HSC wellbeing will be investigated. This SBIR Phase I project would be the first to investigate an alternative approach to bleeding HSCs, a technique that has not changed significantly since the late 1800&apos;s. At scale, the proposed approach would also be expected to improve product quality and traceability, and ultimately the bottom line of companies producing LAL kits, given a surplus of LAL in the supply chain.

The goal is to develop dopaminergic (DA) neural progenitor cells (NPCs) from transdifferentiated human adult adipocytes using a DA cell induction cocktail. This will have application in cellular therapeutics and research tools for Parkinson&apos;s Disease (PD), and other neuronal diseases. In addition, these studies will impact the field of stem cell research and regenerative medicine, since this will be the first demonstration that functional neuronal cells, the main building blocks of brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nervous systems, can be produced from mature fat cells that can be used as cellular therapeutics for several neurological disorders. This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop new technology for generation of midbrain dopaminergic (DA) neural progenitor cells (NPCs) from adult adipocytes (fat cells), which will used as a platform to develop cellular therapeutics for Parkinson&apos;s Disease (PD), and PD research tools. Recently, using a chemical genetics approach (chemical approach or small molecule approach), engraftable midbrain DA neuronal progenitor cells (DA NPCs) from human bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-hMSCs) have been generated. Additionally, DA neuronal progenitor-like cells also had been produced from de-differentiated fat cells (DFAT cells) that have several advantages over BM-hMSCs such as homogeneity of DFAT cell cultures, ease of isolation and low immunogenicity. The goal of Phase I project is to validate and optimize the DA induction protocol for generation of midbrain DA NPC from DAFT cells. Phase II will focus on clinical grade manufacturing of these DA cells and testing their therapeutic effect in several preclinical animal models of PD. Commercial products emerging from Phase I\/II work include cellular therapeutics for PD and research tools for PD.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is for the development of an automated manufacturing process for polymeric, ultra-lightweight, bicycle spokes composed of an ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) and stainless steel hybrid structure. The use of an innovative polymer-to-metal connection allows for the creation of a bicycle spoke that out-performs modern stainless steel spokes. In comparison, steel spokes are heavier, do not effectively damp road vibrations, and are more prone to fatigue related failure. The target market for this innovation is the high-end bicycle spoke market, which is valued at over $100M. The research of new polymeric materials at universities is at an all-time high. Despite this, there exists a gap in the commercialization of new materials because of the difficulty in interfacing these materials to other common construction materials, such as stainless steel. This work will contribute fundamental knowledge to and catalyze the development of processes for new advanced polymer products. It will enable the use of UHMWPE and other materials in new applications. The intellectual merit of this project is the development of an advanced manufacturing process capable of the complex manipulation necessary for the production of novel polymer-to-metal connections and integral eye splices. These types of connections are not practiced in high-volume textile manufacturing today due to the novelty of the polymer-to-metal connection and the complexity of the eye splice operation. The research objectives include validating the key steps for process automation and optimization of the UHMWPE-metal connection. The anticipated outcome of this Phase I project is a prototype automated spoke manufacturing process. This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to reduce the power required to cool the data and telecommunications centers that drive the internet age. Currently nearly 2.0% of the energy consumed in the United States is used to run such data centers and, often, half of this is used for cooling. The corresponding greenhouse gas emissions will also be reduced. Longer term this technology can be adapted to increasing the efficiency of air-conditioning\/refrigeration and power generation. Commercially, the computational fluid dynamics software market the product will compete in is projected to grow from $1.3 billion at present to over $2 billion by 2022. It will also stimulate the growth of the manufacture of specialty heat sinks with optimal geometries for efficient thermal management. This intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase I project is based on proposing to hybridize three common numerical methods, i.e., computational fluid dynamics (CFD), flow network modeling (FNM) and multi-variable optimization (MVO), a non-trivial objective. The result will be a software platform that can accurately and simultaneously optimize the geometry of an array of heat sinks found in various types of circuit packs, e.g., blade servers in data centers. This is not possible with CFD alone as it is too slow and it is not possible with FNM alone as it is not sufficiently accurate. The method of the hybrid approach to preserve the accuracy of CFD is to embed pre-computed, non-dimensional look-up tables of flow and thermal resistances from CFD simulations in an FNM. The software will accommodate both single-phase flows of air and water and evaporating\/boiling flows of water and refrigerant, which requires modeling complex heat, mass and momentum transport phenomena. Experiments will validate its accuracy on thermal mock-ups of circuit packs.

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase I project will address a problem of poor oxygen delivery to the core of artificial tissues by providing reliable means of three-dimensional oxygen mapping in vitro and in vivo. The field of tissue engineering regenerative medicine combines the principles of the life sciences, cell biology, and engineering to create functional tissues and organs that can be used for replacing damaged tissues and organs. The public health benefit of replacing damaged tissues and organs is at par with curing cancer. Almost every part of the human body has been considered for replacement. Tissue engineering strives to solve arthritis, Type I diabetes, stroke, vascular diseases, liver and kidney damages, and many other medical problems by replacing or restoring damaged tissues or organs with artificial functional tissues. This project will address the problem of poor oxygen transport in artificial tissue grafts, which is one of the major causes of tissue failure, by developing an oxygen imaging instrument to generate three-dimensional in situ oxygen maps. This instrument will allow scientists to assess oxygen environment over the time of graft production and upon implantation and develop better artificial tissues. The oxygen imager uses cutting-edge radiofrequency and magnet technology and will help create high-tech jobs in the Midwest. The oxygen imager will be based on the innovative noninvasive electron paramagnetic resonance oxygen imaging (EPROI) technology. EPROI uses an injectable water-soluble, non-toxic contrast agent, trityl that has oxygen-dependent relaxation rates. EPROI provides absolute partial oxygen pressure (pO2) maps with high accuracy (~ 1 torr) within 1-10 minutes. The oxygen imager will be equipped with a 25 mT magnet and ~720 MHz electronics suitable for in vitro and small animal in vivo oxygen imaging. The instrument will have user-friendly software for image acquisition, image registration, data processing and analysis. This project will develop the magnet with the top loading of samples along with temperature and gas controlled bioreactor sample chamber for in vitro oxygen mapping of artificial tissues. The robustness and performance of the imager will be tested by acquiring oxygen maps of cell-seeded biomaterials. It is expected that the oxygen imager will become an essential tool in tissue engineering labs of academic institutions and biotech companies and will have a major impact on the successful development of regenerative medicine therapies.

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is that it holds the promise of significantly reducing the over fertilization of crop fields with poultry litter and at the same time provide poultry farmers with greater profits. Currently poultry litter (excrement, feathers, bedding and other waste) is used as fertilizer on crop fields. The litter is excessively high in phosphorous which is not well adsorbed by crops and ends up in waterways causing excessive algae growth resulting in dead zones with no aquatic life. This project expects to prove the practicality of a high efficiency burn system that is low enough in cost to be affordable by individual farmers. The system will burn poultry litter and convert the resulting heat energy to electricity and hot water for heating the farmer&apos;s chicken houses. The energy savings will increase farmer&apos;s net profits (including the amortized cost of the system) by, on average, 25%. Thus poultry farmers will be incentivized to eliminate environmentally dangerous poultry litter by converting their farm waste to energy. This SBIR Phase I project proposes to design, produce and test a scaled prototype version of the lab test system. The lab test system is expected to provide burn efficiencies as high as ~97% with particulate emissions well within EPA standards. The scaled system will be designed to process ten times the litter as the lab system. The primary question this SBIR project will answer is: can the lab results be replicated in a full scale system capable of handling the requirements of an average poultry farm. The patent pending technology upon which the lab system was designed uses computer controlled fuel (poultry litter) feed rates coupled with a multilevel air injection system to produce optimal efficiency. There are several variables that will be tested to ensure upscaling the size will be successful. These include combustion chamber size and design, air injection locations, pressures and CFM, and fuel feed rates. Successful commercialization will require optimization of these variables in a full scale system.

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to develop a drug discovery platform for preclinical cancer drug testing using a 3D tumor model technology. The technology is designed to reduce time and costs associated with the high failure rate (~95%) of cancer drugs by increasing the likelihood that candidate drugs advancing to animal studies will be effective. The robotic technology will provide a biologically relevant tumor model to test libraries of cancer drugs in the preclinical stage, and replace currently used 2D cancer cell models. This project aims to scale up the 3D tumor model technology to accommodate large drug libraries tested in the pharmaceutical industry, and verify that it meets industry standards and customer needs. The technology will expedite the introduction of effective cancer drugs into the market for patient use, and help reduce the more than half a million of lives that cancer claims annually. The proposed work will significantly facilitate the introduction of the technology into the market as a preclinical cancer drug screening tool by demonstrating its competitive advantages and capabilities to improve cancer drug discovery efforts. This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop and validate a 3D tumor model technology for high-throughput cancer drug screening in the pharmaceutical industry. Despite widespread interest in 3D cancer cell cultures, existing methods are not currently used in the industry due to their many disadvantages. The proposed technology provides a robust, high-throughput, and cost-effective approach to generate 3D cancer cell cultures for rapid drug screening, beyond what is currently available. This work will evaluate quantitatively the reliability and robustness of 3D cancer cell cultures and costs of cancer drug testing while considering competitive techniques. A major goal is to adapt the technology to a 1536-microwell plate format for highly efficient drug screening, which is not currently available on the market, and validate the capabilities of the technology to predict cancer drug responses in animal studies. This work will involve robotic protocol optimization, imaging analysis of 3D cultures for consistency, proof-of-concept cancer drug screening, and statistical evaluation of robustness. It is anticipated that the work will demonstrate the advantageous capacity and speed of the technology for drug testing, industry-level robustness, compatibility with different cancer cell types, ability to predict animal study drug responses, and low cost.

In fact, fabricating semiconductor devices is so challenging that 55% of new semiconductor products fail to meet their original launch date and over 40% of development projects exceed the planned budgets. With its proposed virtual recipe development environment, this SBIR project will allow semiconductor chip and equipment manufacturers to save up to 66% of process development costs, gain market share through three times faster development cycles, and enable the process development of next-generation of high performance, energy efficient electronic devices. The proposed project will use statistical self-learning inference algorithms, sophisticated process models, and the vast amount of available fab data to make high accuracy process predictions and enable high volume manufacturing of innovative nanotechnologies. Three key components will be developed: (1) A recipe analytics engine capable of performing process predictions and process design for multiple process objectives, (2) A topography simulator for profile prediction of nanofeatures, and (3) A commercial platform interface for real-time process development decision making. The components will be devised to accurately capture large process systems and multiple process objectives, reduce computational expense, and facilitate commercial adoption. These innovations will be accomplished by: (a) Using parallel computing to reduce computational expense, (b) Developing reduced-order plasma and surface kinetic models, (c) Employing adaptive algorithms to accelerate recipe optimization, and (d) Using uncertainty analysis techniques for recipe co-optimization.

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase I project aims to develop and demonstrate the feasibility of a system that can identify a broad range of bacteria in &lt; 1 hour directly from blood. Existing diagnostic systems require 2-6 days to identify the bacteria, which delays treatment using appropriate antibiotics. Sepsis, which is often caused by a bacterial infection, contributes to up to half of all hospital deaths in the US largely due to complications arising from delays or inappropriate treatment (which is mainly because of lack of information regarding the infection-causing bacteria). It is the most expensive hospital-treated condition in the United States ? representing $20.3 billion in healthcare costs. The proposed system aims to sharply reduce the time to provide information needed by physicians, enabling them to initiate treatment using the appropriate antibiotic rapidly. This is expected to lead to significant reductions in costs, complications, and mortality. Further, by eliminating the need for culturing, new insights into bacterial behavior can be acquired contributing to additional fundamental knowledge of bacteria. This knowledge will aid antibiotic discovery efforts, improve understanding of mechanisms of drug resistance, support new biomanufacturing processes through faster detection of bacterial contamination of pharmaceutical products and foods, and characterization of the microbiome. The challenges of rapid bacterial identification are primarily in two areas ? sample preparation, that eliminates the need for culturing, and multiplex identification, to cover the diverse range of bacterial species capable of causing infection. The proposed work is based on leveraging the differential response between bacteria and the cells in a sample matrix to selectively break down the sample matrix, but not bacteria, such that the largest lysis debris is smaller than intact bacteria. The debris is subsequently separated from intact bacteria using a size-based technique enabling rapid isolation of a broad range of bacteria directly from the sample. A novel Fourier-transform infrared microspectroscopy system is then used to identify the isolated bacteria at clinically relevant concentrations. No bacteria-specific reagents are employed. The proposed Phase I work addresses the highest risk technical hurdles in the process. Isolating and detecting low concentration of bacteria directly from blood is accomplished through the three objectives of this project that optimize the purification and bacterial recovery from the sample, identification accuracy, and performance of the integrated system relative to the traditional culturing-based method. This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase I project uses novel technologies to produce an attractive, affordable and commercial product and service, RestEaZe translating to the home the sleep lab evaluations of restless sleep for millions of adults with insomnia and children with ADHD and RLS. An analysis of significant sleep features that should be evaluated for at-home sleep monitoring indicated that at least these should include total sleep time, brief arousals, wake during sleep, sleep efficiency, periodic leg movements in sleep and sleep position. Moreover these need to be developed and validated for adults as well as children. The analyses indicate that sleep monitoring should be based on leg and not arm movement. RestEaZe, for the first time ever, both phenotypes and also measures the leg movements of sleep (LMS) and using logistic regression and advanced machine learning identifies LMS characteristics that accurately predict these significant sleep measures. RestEaZe translates advanced sleep science from the lab to the home. The user gets an immediate scientifically accurate view of quiet vs. restless sleep and changes in sleep over several nights in relation to user entered sleep behavior. RestEaZe also provides professionally developed interactive guides for improving sleep based on RestEaZe results. The doctor gets advanced movement and sleep analyses with interactive graphic and numeric summaries of the patient&apos;s sleep over several days. The analyses will reveal both sleep quality, circadian pattern and PLMS. The PLMS reveal possible medical conditions such as sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome (RLS), cardiac morbidity and REM behavior disorder.

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase I project will create a novel educational product by pairing VR\/360 video with impact measurement software and interactive social engagement tools to simulate true-to-life experiences that enable users to gain personal insight into pressing social issues and then take action to solve them. Installed either as a multisensory &apos;empathy exhibition&apos; or used in a classroom setting, participants embark on a transformative learning journey which builds empathy and critical understanding about a social issue and those affected by it, then connects them to concrete opportunities to make social change. Users begin as uniformed participants, and through the proposed process emerge as changemakers engaged in solving social problems. Experiential learning has long been an empathy building discipline outside the mediated experience, yet it is encumbered by barriers of cost, safety, distance, time and access that limit participation. Transformation360 will use technology to render experiential learning programs virtually anywhere. The result will be a revolutionary new way to move the public from apathy to action on a limitless number of social issues. Transformation360 will provide nonprofits, governments, and institutions working to solve social problems with a powerful social engagement tool that creates actively engaged citizens, consumers, volunteers, supporters, and social entrepreneurs to address the world&apos;s most pressing social problems. This SBIR Phase I project will develop a VR\/360 video hybridization that will allow users interactive choices within a conventional three-degree-of-freedom 360 Video experience. Currently only VR&apos;s computer-generated imaging can provide a significant choice landscape for users. By using 360\/3D photography, unique game engine software and multi-scenario video capture in the field the project will give users a new level of choice options for a photo documentary experiences. The efficacy of this technology for building empathy will be quantified through audience testing. Also, cinematic techniques such as mise-en-cine and montage, not currently used in most 360 video projects, will also be tested against audience reactions. These video production and consumption technologies and techniques will also be cross-tested against experience learning processes such as the breaking down assumptions, peer learning, debriefing, uncertainty, and risk. Potential adverse side effects to VR\/360 video will also be addressed. The project will rely heavily on the engagement measurement and data visualization tool Harvis to test and analyze audience reactions to these experiments.

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to develop a protein replacement for soy-based marine animal diets to improve yield through effective nutrition and enhanced animal welfare. Aquafeeds represent &gt;50% of the cost of production, and losses due to mortality can be as high as 50% in certain commercial species. A novel feed ingredient that contains immuno-nutritional properties to address these inefficiencies could be considered a game-changer to the industry. Fish are the most resource-efficient sources of animal protein, a healthy source of food for people, and will be one of the ways to address food security. As the surface of the planet is greater than two-thirds ocean, one estimate suggests, if managed properly, just 2% of this vast resource could produce enough food for all of mankind. This SBIR Phase I project proposes to expand previous studies that suggested a novel single cell protein (SCP) is a significant candidate to serve as a fishmeal alternative. In addition, SCP also may contain functional properties that improve growth performance and survival. The SCP tested previously supported improved feed conversion ratios (FCR) as compared to conventional diets, while at the same time, statistically relevant improvements in survival of carnivorous fish and shrimp. It also was observed that SCP relieved secondary disease complications associated with diets, such as gastro-enteritis. With hundreds of marketable species in aquaculture, and an industry that is just 50 years old, the collective understanding of aquatic animal nutrition is in its infancy. In this project, a carnivorous Seriola species will be used as a model organism to serve as an additional reference point beyond salmon. Targeted components of the SCP will be enhanced (or deleted) to determine the effect of leading immuno-nutritional candidates on the animals&apos; ability to digest more completely inputs like soy bean meal (SBM). The effectiveness of SCPs in emerging commercial fish diets has yet to be fully elucidated, and the results of this study may have implications towards lower-cost feed formulations and optimized nutrition.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is focussed on developing a plasma jet printing technology to serve the printed electronics industry. Printed electronic devices including flexible electronics and flexible hybrid electronics (FHE) are next generation smart devices that have applications in both consumer and industrial segments. These devices combine the flexibility and low cost of printed substrates made of plastic with the performance of semiconductor devices to create a new category of electronics. The main challenge in FHE is integration of semiconductor die to the flexible substrate and interconnects. Plasma jet printing has high potential to address the problems associated with printed electronics manufacturing, in particular the interconnects. The plasma process control allows printing metallic materials with required electronic properties by in-situ treatment, thereby eliminating the need for post processing. The global market for printed electronics equipment is $1.5 billion in 2017 and is estimated to reach $4 billion globally in 2020 and growing at a compound annual growth rate of 38%. Immediate industrial application of our technology is in replacing wire bonding with direct write printing of metallic interconnects for flexible hybrid electronics. The intellectual merit of this project is in developing a plasma jet print head hardware for direct write printing of conducting metallic interconnects with reduced process steps. The project focus will be on technological de-risking of the print head hardware and process de-risking for reliable and re-producible printing. Developing the plasma process that can be used for pre-treatment of substrate, in-situ treatment of nanoparticles, printing and post processing all in one tool and simultaneously can reduce the process steps, number of equipments needed and time taken for manufacturing. Oxidation of metal nanoparticle ink and its limited shelf life is currently being addressed by polymer capping of the nanoparticles and thermal\/laser processing. Developing a plasma process that can be used to print high quality conducting patterns using in-situ treatment can take the technology closer to adoption by printed electronics industry. The anticipated outcome of this project is a robust plasma jet print head and a process that can reliably and reproducibly print conducting metal films with tailored oxidation state and electronic structure.

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to use self-assembling nanoparticle systems made from renewable, bio-based materials to replace manufacturing processes that conventionally rely on high-energy reaction conditions and petroleum-based chemicals. This innovation will enhance technical understanding of the property-performance relationship between chemistry formulations, nanoparticle morphology, and product performance. This project will enable US manufacturers to reduce their production and disposal of toxic waste and utilize locally produced feedstocks and inputs in manufacturing process that are lower in carbon intensity, and will also create new markets for US produced feedstocks and materials. This SBIR Phase I project proposes to optimize a green nanoparticle-forming solvent system that self-assamble to function as &quot;microreactor&quot; vessels that can produce cathode materials which are used in rechargeable battery systems for the growing energy storage market. Solution-based synthesis methods have been used to prepare different cathode materials, but control over product structure and quality requires detailed understanding of the solution chemistry, which can be obscured by downstream variables that are introduced during electrode formation. This screening process will be streamlined by characterizing and quantifying the properties of intermediates produced in order to determine optimal chemistry formulation, particle size, and calcination conditions for battery performance. The approach will use rapid characterization methods that require only microscale quantities of material in order to develop a sensitivity matrix that relates the impact of renewable composition inputs and reaction variables on cathode material size and morphology, allowing prediction of overall battery performance.

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this project is through providing a sensitive, robust, room temperature operating magnetometer. Magnetometers are among the most widely used instruments in a variety of applications including healthcare, transportation safety, food contamination monitoring, and homeland security. In fact, the growing need for magnetic field sensors manifests itself in the $1.6 billion global market with a fast-growing medical segment. As for today, the maximum sensitivity is provided by the Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices. The high sensitivity is critically important for medical applications. However, this high sensitivity can be achieved in the superconducting devices only at cryogenic temperatures. The proposed magnetometer based on spin wave interferometer combines high sensitivity with room temperature operation. This combination provides a great improvement in healthcare by reducing the cost of equipment, in transportation safety enhancement by providing more accurate traffic control, and in food safety monitoring by detecting small concentrations of heavy metals. It will be of great benefit to society to have a magnetometer combining the high sensitivity of superconducting devices and room temperature operation. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the need for sensitive and room temperature operating magnetic field sensors by providing a magnetometer based on spin wave interferometer. There are different types of magnetic sensors available on the market. As of today, the maximum sensitivity up to attoTesla is provided by the Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices. However, this high sensitivity can be achieved only at cryogenic temperatures. The latter makes superconducting magnetometers expensive and limits its practical application. The proposed magnetometer is based on spin wave interference and free of constraints inherent in superconducting devices. The research objectives encompass the development and demonstration of a compact, non-expensive magnetometer with up to attoTesla sensitivity operating in a temperature range from cryogenic to 560 K. The outcomes of the proposed research will have an impact on commercial, defense and homeland security applications that need increasingly precise and robust magnetic sensors. The development of compact and high-sensitive magnetometer will be relevant to bio-sensing and bio-medical applications as well.

        "abstract": "The broader impact \/ commercial potential of this project would be in the ability to deploy drones in industrial and commercial indoor environments as aerial robots. A key requirement to deploying drones in such indoor environments in the presence of people is to make them safe and non-threatening. In addition, for drones to function as robots, they need to be made fully autonomous and minimize the need for human operation or intervention. These attributes are not possible with conventional drone technology today. The ability to use drones as aerial robots can open up opportunities in large markets such as warehouse inventory scanning, construction, security, and factory automation. Such robots can enable functions such as scanning and reconstruction of the environment, or also ?pick and place? at high throughput within factories. The use of drones in industrial indoor environments for these applications can also result in broader societal benefits, including improved worker safety inside industrial indoor environments (by performing tasks that may otherwise require harnesses, forklifts or ladders); reduced environmental impacts (in construction sites by catching discrepancies early and minimizing rework and material wastage) and macroeconomic benefits (enabling automated factories of the future and bringing back US jobs). This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project has the potential to advance the frontiers of knowledge in design and control systems for use in drones and other applications. This unique approach redefines the control systems for rotorcraft, and enables a drone with dramatically improved metrics ? as much as 10X -- that are traditionally used to characterize the performance of drones. In this Phase I project, Vimaan plans to complete the design and modeling of the system, develop the control mechanisms for the system, and integrate, test and demonstrate the application of the innovation to a drone that has the above attributes. During the project, Vimaan will need to overcome some critical technical challenges in the components and systems design, the control circuitry and controls algorithms and the power budgets, timings and optimizations of the sub-systems for the required performance. If successful, such an innovation would revolutionize decades old legacy technologies that have been hitherto deployed in rotorcraft, and make possible attributes that have been long sought after by the aerospace industry. This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to address the most common causes of blindness worldwide. Retinal diseases account for vision loss in over 25 million Americans. Worldwide, the prevalence of blindness in children is determined largely by socioeconomic development and availability preventative care. By 2020, the World Health Organization estimates that visual impairment among children age 14 and under will reach almost 19 million, and adults will reach almost 266 million. This SBIR Phase I project proposes a SMART surgical tool to enable safe and precise delivery of stem cells and genes to help repair and restore the vision of patients with retinal degeneration. Studies have shown cell transplant technology and injectable therapeutics improve vision in afflicted patients. However, due to the delicate nature of retinal tissue, this procedure is challenging to perform successfully. The proposed tool addresses the unmet need for better visualization and targeted delivery of therapeutic agents. Precise delivery of treatment is expected to deliver benefits in preventing and correcting retinal diseases.

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will contribute to development of a novel Balance-Enhancing Footwear Insert for preventing falls in the high risk elderly population. Falls are the leading cause of fatal injuries and the most common reason for trauma-related hospital admissions among older adults. One in every four Americans over age of 65 falls each year, and the financial burden from the falls in the elderly is expected to reach $67B by 2020. Therefore, introduction of a smart insole might significantly reduce the financial burden for the Medical Care System. It will also allow the elderly population to achieve maximum independence in the activities of daily living. The proposed insole will also address the critical needs of the athletic shoe industry to reduce the incidents of ankle sprains. The development of the new smart balance?enhancing insole, which improves balance without irritation and habituation effects will likely lead to new fabrication techniques for manufacturing insoles. This SBIR innovation has the potential to introduce to the market a safe, reliable and cost-effective insole that could be easily manufactured and distributed. This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a novel insole to facilitate proper and timely response to a person?s movements in order to maintain good balance while walking or standing. The plantar sole is a ?dynamometric map? of human balance control. The loss of balance occurs when the body weight is shifted too close to the plantar sole boundary. The timely information to the Central Nervous System (CNS) about such movements is critical for balance control. The proposed insert, with a system of microcells containing viscous fluid, triggers instantaneous rise of protrusions around the insole perimeter area in response to the sudden increase of pressure that excites the mechanoreceptors reporting to the CNS. Such a balance-enhancing solution provides well-timed regional amplification of cutaneous mechanoreceptor sensitivity but without the side effects of the existing textured insoles. The shortcomings include permanent discomfort and irritation in the plantar sole, which results in desensitization of the sole somatosensory system. The main research objectives include: Engineering design of the insert; research of materials to meet the performance goals; identification of the manufacturers for future mass production; creating testing frameworks to insure performance according to the required specifications.

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase I project will address the pedagogical and evaluative problems caused by our current inability to measure core outcomes beyond information recall. The proposed innovation makes important educational outcomes such as deep understanding, cognition (thinking skills) and awareness of thinking (metacognition) measurable. Reliable assessment of these outcomes has broad significance to education and society writ large, as many employers struggle with skills gaps between high school and college graduates and the professional, personal and societal demands on adults in the 21st Century. This research combines cognitive science, epistemology, systems science, and complex systems with new developments in artificial intelligence, including machine learning and neural networks, and aligns well with the NSF&apos;s mission to promote progress in science and advance national prosperity. This project not only has the potential to impact core tenets of educational practice - including how teachers teach, how learners learn, and how we measure and understanding knowledge - but also may have impact on science through increased ability to map and analyze patterns and common structures in knowledge and generally for Americans to increase their developmental skills and abilities. Beginning in an educational market valued at $8-15 billion, this project has the potential to catalyze significant job creation and have significant commercial impact across a range of related industries. This SBIR Phase I project introduces a visual grammar for mapping ideas in a canvas-based environment, and provides a neural-network based mechanism for quantitatively comparing expressions of complex ideas along many dimensions to facilitate a new approach to thinking, learning, and assessment. Maps of ideas will be tokenized and serialized and then fed through a recurrent neural network model to produce encoded numeric vector representations that are meaningfully comparable in their encoded form. Once in this form, vectors will be compared and evaluated for content and structure similarity, and insights offered in many dimensions: depth of detail, understanding of relationships, and numerous other meaningful measures. These vectors enable scalable, consistent, constructive assessment in a way not previously possible. In the mapping environment, teachers and students will create maps either on their own, or collaboratively together in real-time. As users create maps, we use the generated vectors to analyze both content and structure, and then prompt users to think about their subject matter from new perspectives. As a means of evaluation, teachers will create mapping activities for students to complete, and then student maps will be quantitatively compared to the standards and target maps which represent the complete understanding of the topic.

        "abstract": "The?broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is represented by the development of a company in a unique field of single crystal growth addressing needs in solid-state lasers. Single crystal growth represents a small and highly specialized, but absolutely essential, area of modern materials technology. Solid-state lasers are commercially vital because they are compact, durable, relatively inexpensive, and field deployable in many technologies. Single crystals are essential components to solid-state lasers and thereby represent significant commercial potential. This project will enhance the skill set of specialty manufacturers of high quality single crystals for solid-state lasers. It represents an unmet commercial need in short wavelength solid-state lasers and also will expand the technological skill set of single crystal growers. This last point is especially important, as there is a serious lack of skills, technology and infrastructure in solid state laser production in this country, and this makes the US increasingly dependent on offshore suppliers of essential materials. This program will help train the next generation of critical materials manufacturing experts in the US. The proposed project intends to address the development of new single crystals called Strontium Beryllium Borate (SBBO). These crystals are an enabling technology for the manufacture of short wavelength solid-state lasers lasing at and below 266 nm. Such lasers have many potential applications but at present there are no materials capable of practical performance at these very short wavelengths. This shortcoming represents a significant commercial opportunity. The project will examine production of single crystals of a new material to meet this need using hydrothermal synthesis, which employs very hot water at high pressures as a growth environment. In this Phase I project, research will be undertaken to develop a growth protocol of large single crystals of this vital material, A feedstock will be perfected, and seed crystals will be produced. Transport conditions will be optimized, and suitable temperature gradients will be identified. Preliminary evaluation of crystal quality will be performed. Suitable crystals will be sent to collaborators in the laser manufacturing industry for preliminary production of solid-state short wavelength lasers. The seed crystals and growth protocols from the research in this Phase I program will be used in a Phase II project for development of a full-scale commercial manufacturing process for this crystal.

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to unleash the full potential of renewable electricity generation sources such as wind and solar photovoltaic by augmenting those generation assets with ultra-low-cost energy storage that matches the dispatchability and dependability of fossil fuels. The combination of renewable generation sources with ultra-low-cost, long-duration energy storage enables a new class of generation assets &quot;baseload renewables&quot; which further US energy independence and leadership in the wind and solar industries. Due to their fundamental cost positions and\/or inability to scale, existing energy storage technologies are unable to meet the price and performance requirements for these long-duration energy storage applications; even the most aggressive forecasts for pricing indicate that lithium ion batteries are an order of magnitude too expensive for these applications. This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop ultra-low-cost (24h rated duration) energy storage solutions to enable renewable generation sources to be a cost effective, widespread, drop-in replacement to fossil fuel electricity generation. Air-breathing aqueous sulfur batteries provide a unique platform for the development of system-level long-duration storage assets meeting these stringent cost and performance targets. The technology platform leverages low-cost, abundant chemicals such as sulfur, water, and air, to enable an ultra-low-cost electrochemical energy storage system. In Phase I of this SBIR, a prototype air-breathing energy storage device will be developed and demonstrated that significantly reduces the power cost ($\/kW) of this technology. This will be achieved by systematically investigating and optimizing the electrochemical active and inactive materials and by designing cell and system architectures which are optimized for long-duration air-breathing electrochemical systems.

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in improving the quality of general and task lighting and reducing the amount of wasted light, thus reducing energy consumption. Solid state lighting has caused a paradigm shift in the lighting industry. However, the rapid growth of the LED has surpassed our understanding of its effects on human health and productivity, as well as the environment. Developing systems that put light only where it is needed can reduce energy consumption and improve well-being by eliminating glare and wasted light. Full control over where artificial lights shine may also reduce the disruption of natural ecosystems and agriculture caused by light pollution.? Unfortunately, a compact and low-cost solution to spatially controllable illumination is not available. Should one be brought to market, the industry could be tailored to meet the needs of each street lamp, each office worker and the entertainment industry among others. The ubiquitous nature of artificial illumination provides a unique commercial opportunity with multiple market segments for growth potential. The proposed project will focus on a microsystems solution to steerable lighting using a low-power, low-cost, silicon-based mirror less than 1 mm in diameter. The mirror is capable of real-time adjustments that will steer incident light with significant angular range. It is controlled using digital electronics and easily combined with traditional smart home electronics. The objective of the research is to measure the optical output of varying system setups and optical components to determine what optics are necessary for proper light output shape, uniformity, and color temperature. The project will rely heavily on a combination of test measurements and simulations to cycle through experiments rapidly and efficiently in order to converge on a manufacturing plan.

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to develop technology to prevent seafood fraud through enabling wholesalers, restaurants, and consumers to rapidly identify mislabeled fish product outside of controlled laboratory settings. U.S. consumers are subjected to mislabeling errors one out of every three times they consume seafood. Species that are cheaper and easier to source are commonly swapped for higher value fish such as tuna, snapper, and grouper. This substitution occurs at multiple points in the supply chain, from producers\/processors to wholesalers to restaurants. U.S. consumers pay approximately $32 billion for mislabeled seafood on an annual basis. Additionally, this seafood may pose a serious health concern or counteract regulatory efforts focused on managing vulnerable fish populations and illegal fishing. Current seafood identification efforts are insufficient to eradicate mislabeling because they require controlled laboratory settings and highly trained personnel. A few portable tests are becoming available but they lack the ability to screen large numbers of samples cost-effectively. The platform proposed here will enable more widespread seafood identification testing by delivering identification within 45 minutes, on-site, and for a lower per sample cost than existing technologies. This SBIR Phase I project proposes to address seafood mislabeling by developing a fast and portable DNA-based screening platform to allow for accurate seafood identification to address concerns from consumers, retailers, and regulators regarding seafood mislabeling. The key component of the platform to be developed is a nanopore-based sensor technology, which is an amplification-free method for direct counting of target nucleic acids. It has been demonstrated in preliminary results that the technology is able to distinguish grouper DNA from catfish with single-nucleotide specificity. This technology also has achieved multiplexed detection, distinguishing 36 sequences with one sensor. This project will advance this detection assay towards a commercial-ready product by expanding the multiplexing strategy to cover 200+ sequences, designing probes to distinguish 20+ fish species, and then completing a full commercial proof-of-principle by identifying seafood species in blinded samples in work done on-site. This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is the reduction of the cost of wind energy through a robust, inexpensive, and efficient vertical-axis wind turbine (VAWT). This project has the potential to increase global wind power production through technological advancements that lower installation, operations, and maintenance costs via an innovative design which addresses reliability and efficiency concerns that have previously limited the penetration of VAWTs into the wind energy market. Compared to the common horizontal-axis wind turbine (HAWT), the proposed technology requires an order of magnitude fewer components. Additionally, heavy and maintenance intensive components are located at ground level for ease of access. One initial market for this technology will be stand-alone, small-scale generation, where this technology will provide long-lasting, low-maintenance power for remote locations. Another initial market is the repowering and augmentation of existing wind turbine arrays. Here, this technology will be a cost effective method of revitalizing underperforming or aging HAWT farms. The long-term objective is large-scale, VAWT-only arrays. Recent scientific advances indicate that, unlike HAWTs, interactions between VAWTs can be beneficial, resulting in cost-effective, high-output wind farms. This SBIR Phase I project proposes to address the reliability and efficiency concerns that have previously limited the penetration of VAWTs into the wind energy market. XFlow Energy&apos;s novel design utilizes a robust, stationary central shaft extending the length of the rotor, reducing harmful loading to the rotor structure. This design requires a larger central shaft than VAWTs tested to date, and the impact of a large central shaft on VAWT power output has not been previously investigated. Laboratory-scale tests will be performed on a range of geometries to analyze the fluid-dynamic impact of larger central shafts and the resulting changes in turbine performance and loading. This information will inform the design and structural simulation of a 500 W turbine. This design will be prototyped and will undergo thorough performance measurements. Ultimately destructive testing will be performed to identify structural deficiencies, and the design updated appropriately. The objective of SBIR Phase I is to produce a 500 W turbine that is thoroughly characterized, can survive up to 100 mph winds, and is ready for commercialization. This design will inform development of a utility-scale turbine (&gt;50 kW) which will be the focus of SBIR Phase II.

        "abstract": "This Phase I SBIR project will investigate cure-in-place materials for filling and stabilizing open wounds to promote healing. Chronic wounds represent a significant and debilitating burden to patients, affecting more than 6.5 million people in the US alone. The incidence of chronic wounds is expected to rise with increasing rates of obesity and diabetes, but current treatment options show limited clinical efficacy. To address this unmet need, new materials that stimulate the body&apos;s healing mechanisms must be developed. This project will evaluate a promising new material that can be applied to a wound as a liquid and cured to a solid in contact with the wound. This cure-in-place process is expected to promote healing by ensuring intimate contact between the pro-healing material and the wound bed, mechanically stabilizing the wound area, and stimulating the body&apos;s healing responses. There are few cure-in-place materials in clinical use, so this project will also generate new fundamental engineering knowledge about these materials and their potential applications in human health. The advanced wound care market is currently valued at more than $8 billion, and it is growing. Therefore, innovative technologies in this space represent significant business opportunities that create economic growth. This project will investigate a novel cure-in-place process for generating a polysaccharide biomaterial that mimics the mechanical and structural properties of native extracellular matrix to stimulate wound healing. The material is generated by curing two aqueous precursor solutions to form a biodegradable, solid, and hydrated polymer matrix. This project will investigate a cure-in-place process by which the precursor solutions will be applied to the wound as liquids and cured in contact with the wound bed. If the extracellular matrix replacement biomaterial can be cured inside of a wound bed, then its pro-healing effects may be amplified due to its ability to fill an irregularly-shaped wound with complete contact with tissue and its capacity to mechanically stabilize the wound bed and stimulate pro-healing biochemistry. The scope of this effort will include developing an optimized formulation for the cure-in-place precursor solution, determining curing conditions for the biomaterial in contact with tissue, evaluating the material properties of the cure-in-place product, and evaluating cure-in-place application and wound healing efficacy in a porcine excisional wound model.

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase I project entails the development of an EEG analysis software application that identifies the epileptogenic zone (EZ - where seizures start in brain) in medically refractory epilepsy (MRE) patients. Over 1 million people in the US have MRE, meaning that they do not respond to medication. MRE patients are frequently hospitalized, burdened by epilepsy-related disabilities, and contribute to 80% of the $16 billion dollars spent annually in the US treating epilepsy patients. There are 2 treatments: (i) surgical removal of the EZ, and (ii) neurostimulation, where the EZ is electrically stimulated to suppress seizures. Successful outcomes depend critically on accurately identifying the EZ from invasive EEG recordings, which is a long costly process, leading to grim outcomes where 30%-70% of treated patients continue to have seizures. There has thus been an intensive search for an accurate data analytics tool to reduce time, risks and costs of invasive monitoring. This project involves further development of such a tool that generates visual &quot;heat&quot; maps from EEG data. The tool, grounded in dynamical systems theory and neuroengineering, has been validated with data from 20 patients, achieving 95% accuracy in predicting surgical outcomes. Reducing monitoring time reduces the risk of infection from the brain being exposed, and reduces hospital costs associated with lengthy stays and clinical staff reviewing data. By providing more accurate definition of the EZ, the tool will also enable use of a precise and entirely new laser ablation procedure that makes tiny lesions in targeted structures as opposed to removing large portions of the brain. If successful, the tool will be closer to commercialization under a sustainable business model. Major EEG vendors and medical device companies are looking for accurate software applications in epilepsy treatment to enhance their product suites, and will be very interested in licensing the tool. This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project involves development of a cutting-edge EEG tool that uses dynamic network modeling and a highly innovative and patented theory of &quot;fragility&quot; of nodes in a dynamic network to localize the EZ from invasive EEG recordings, taking into account the extensive interconnection of neurons in the brain. The more &quot;fragile&quot; an EEG channel, the more likely it is in the EZ. Project aims are to (i) validate the tool on a large patient cohort, using invasive EEG data before, during and after seizure events; (i) test the tool?s efficacy using noninvasive scalp EEG recordings and (iii) design the user-interface and integrate this application into the existing clinical workflow to facilitate prospective studies. These milestones will minimize key risks in bringing this innovation to market, which are adoption, perceived liability, regulatory approval and reimbursement. Adoption risk will be mitigated if the tool is accurate, quick and easy-to-use, requiring essentially the push of a button to receive fragility maps. Accuracy risk will be mitigated if our completed retrospective study, including refinement of network models, shows comparable performance to our preliminary data. The quick and easy-to-use risks will be mitigated with the development of an intuitive interface that importantly integrates with the existing EEG data acquisition and visualization tools. Regulatory risk is low as a predicate device exists. Perceived liability of the tool in mis-diagnosis is a low risk as the tool is not intended to replace the clinician&apos;s analysis, but rather it provides an enhanced visualization of the EEG data (as demonstrated in our retrospective study) already being collected and analyzed in the clinical workflow. Finally, reimbursement risks will be mitigated if accurate identification of the EZ using the tool has the potential to significantly reduce or even eliminate the focal MRE segment reducing epilepsy-related costs by $6 billion\/year.

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase I project develops a bacterial platform for intracellular drug delivery to solid tumors, with a primary focus on liver cancer. Every year, 30,000 men and women are diagnosed with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which has a 5-year survival rate of 17.6 %. The prognosis for these patients is poor. Currently, there are no curative treatments for these patients. The current standard-of-care only increases overall survival by months and has toxic side effects, with a cost to the US healthcare system of $1.5B per year. This technology is based on the inherent feature of bacteria to colonize solid tumors throughout the body in ratios of 100,000 to 1 compared to healthy tissue. Due to this specificity, the developed bacterial platform has the potential to increase dosage specifically in tumors, while reducing toxic side effects in healthy tissues. This platform will be a toolbox that can target intracellular pathways that are currently considered undruggable and deliver potent doses of biologicals directly into tumor cells. The affinity of bacteria for solid tumors, independent of organ localization, enables the extension of this delivery method to other hard-to-treat tumor types, such as pancreas, ovarian and gastric cancer. Systemic cancer therapies have many obstacles, such as stability in the blood, traversing the cellular membrane, internalization and endosomal release. These processes impede the use of RNAi and peptides in humans and hamper the targeting of intracellular pathways with monoclonal antibodies. The development of a bacterial drug delivery platform can optimize drug potency in tumors and reduce side effects in healthy tissue. In this SBIR phase I, efficacy of this platform will be measured in HCC by targeting intracellular pathways essential for cell survival, for which no systemic therapy exists. A bacterial strain will be created according to FDA guidelines that can be manufactured reliably without loss of activity. An optimized preservation protocol will be developed to ensure maximal bacterial fitness and maximal delivery efficacy after administration. This bacterial delivery system has the potential to accelerate the translation of fundamental cancer research into clinical therapies. Discoveries could be genetically translated directly into protein, antibody or shRNA therapies that regulate mammalian gene expression and function.

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase I project is dedicated to producing software that makes it easy for people with special needs, especially those on the autism spectrum, to compose their own music. A wide base of evidence shows that music can be a powerful emotional and creative outlet for people with disabilities. Multiple studies show that music can help children on the autism spectrum improve their skills in social interaction, verbal communication,initiating behavior, and social-emotional reciprocity. However, public access to music education has declined dramatically in the United States over the last 40 years. The 6.6 million students in the US with special needs face further barriers to music education because of the significant financial resources and demanding degree of physical dexterity required by instrument lessons. Within this context, private sector innovation is more necessary than ever to increase the accessibility of music education. By offering affordable and intuitive software this project has the potential to make a major impact on the economy by helping to reduce education and health care costs for parents of children with special needs, school special education programs, and adults with disabilities. Just as importantly, democratizing the joy of musical creativity will make a powerful contribution to unlocking the passion, talents, and productivity of people with special needs. To make it easy for people with special needs to make their own music, this project will employ gestural composition, responsive design, and data science to produce a software interface that adapts to a users&apos; accessibility preferences based on their previous interactions with the program. A second focus of the project is to produce interactive music lessons focused on self-expression and socio-emotional intelligence. Lessons will utilize and expand upon the creative interface to guide users to write songs that express their mood. Robust user testing and intelligent application of machine learning will be required to ensure that the interface smoothly evolves to enable user creativity. Considerable experimentation will also be required to build lessons which strike a balance between supporting users through linear instruction and empowering users to make expressive decisions and take ownership of their emotions. To mitigate the project&apos;s technical risk special needs experts and health professionals will be consulted at every stage of user testing and development. In sum, these innovations address the significant and urgent challenge of opening music up as a medium of creativity, communication and self-expression for people with special needs, especially those on the autism spectrum. This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will result from the development of a scalable, enterprise-ready conversational AI platform that enables businesses to automate customer support requests, optimize call routing efforts to get customers to the right human support agent, generate customer self-service resources like smart FAQs, augment human staff with bot capabilities, and enable personalized recommendations to support sales and purchasing decisions for customers. Such technology is beneficial to any enterprise organization, B2C (business-to-consumer) and B2B (business-to-business), who needs to communicate to customers, employees, and the public. With rising customer service and communication costs, automation is critical for businesses to maintain profitability and competitive advantages. On a societal level, conversational interfaces democratize access to information and resources worldwide. A significant portion of the world&apos;s population lives in regions where internet access is poor and device ownership is rare. Many also suffer from physical limitations, such as impaired vision or limited motor control. Accelerating technology access through conversational interfaces such as SMS and voice has already been shown to transform quality of life for disadvantaged groups through applications in telemedicine, personal finance, and education. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to enable human-level conversational ability in machines. Teaching computers to communicate like humans is a critical step to achieving human-level machine intelligence (HLMI), also called artificial general intelligence (AGI). Current state-of-the-art approaches to automated dialog systems use a combination of supervised learning and reinforcement learning implemented with deep neural network architectures. These approaches have shown promise on toy problems in academic research, but have mixed performance in enterprise settings. This Phase 1 project extends current deep learning approaches by developing a repeatable methodology for annotating and preparing enterprise data for use in dialog systems and a scalable, grounded neural network architecture that can reference external knowledge sources with minimal manual engineering. This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to sell affordable backup generators that provide 23 kilowatts, for operating a home&apos;s lights and appliances. With power outages due to natural disasters and an aging power grid becoming ever more frequent, and with society increasingly reliant on electricity to power not only lights and household appliances, but also computers, wireless routers, and medical devices, back-up power is an increasingly critical need. This SBIR&apos;s portable generator is expected to be more than an order of magnitude lower cubic size and weight, all at a reduced cost compared to existing generators. The broader impact of this project is its significant benefits to the environment by providing backup power at high fuel efficiency (i.e. less consumption of non-renewable fossil fuels) and low emissions of hydrocarbons, particulate matter, carbon monoxide, and smoke. This SBIR Phase I project proposes to address the shortcomings of residential-use backup generators currently on the market. Available backup generators are either small and affordable but can only power a single appliance; or able to power most of a home&apos;s needs but cumbersome and expensive. This project will demonstrate the potential for implementing a free-piston internal combustion engine that will maximize fuel efficiency; minimize size; decrease dependence on lubricating oil; and incorporate an engine management system. The objective of the current effort is the engine, while the functioning compact generator will be developed in the next phase. In this free-piston engine design, the two pistons oscillate with forces in balance and reduced side-loads to the pistons, yielding a long-lasting high-speed engine. The pilot work included modification of the cylinder intake ports; addition of a modified squish band and dome to the cylinder head; and use of low-friction bearing materials yielding a successful prototype that runs on regular gasoline. The engineers will continue implementing, testing, and improving on these modifications. The successful completion of this project will yield an efficient, compact, low-weight, and low-emissions generator that produces 23 kilowatts of usable power that runs on standard pump gasoline. This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will investigate the use of novel photo-switchable adhesives in medical dressings to improve patient safety, hospital compliance and potentially change the standard of care in the field of adhesive dressings. The proposed work differs drastically from other research endeavors to create dismantlable adhesives, whose drawbacks include high costs, difficulty to scale, biocompatibility issues, and inability to effect switching in application within short times. This new research offers advantages of significantly lower costs and easier scale-up using readily available adhesive industry infrastructure. Medical adhesive dressings that easily lose peel adhesion addresses a significant unmet need for preventing medical adhesive related skin injuries (MARSI), a prevalent but under-recognized injury that affects 7% of all patients across all age groups and healthcare settings. MARSI causes about 1.5 million injuries annually in the US alone and it is estimated that MARSI caused $850M in payments withheld to hospitals due to low patient satisfaction. This project is pursing the creation of a medical dressing that addresses these concerns while being cost competitive, easy to use and most importantly, safe to the patient&apos;s skin. Prototype medical dressings will be characterized and tested based on customer requirements. This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project presents a novel adhesive technology platform where use-case characteristics at application are decoupled from end of life\/removal characteristics through photo-switching. Photo-switchable medical adhesive dressings that lose peel adhesion upon application of light address a significant unmet need for preventing medical adhesive related skin injuries (MARSI), a prevalent but under-recognized injury that affects 7% of all patients across all age groups and healthcare settings. The proposed work differs drastically from other research endeavors to create dismantlable adhesives as the proprietary photo-switchable molecules enable change in human safe conditions and in short time frames. The proposed Phase 1 SBIR project would evaluate different proprietary multifunctional crosslinkers to increase the speed of the photo-switch by about 50% to meet clinician needs. This would be followed by experimentally evaluating methodologies to fabricate adhesive lined films for optimal optical switchability at different thicknesses and for different substrates. Finally, the learnings from the above two steps about adhesive coated films will be combined with an existing skincare lamp to demonstrate proof of product. Product performance will be characterized and tested to optimize performance based on customer requirements.

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase I project seeks to commercialize a suite of gaze-driven training games that are designed to train attention orienting, focus, and inhibitory control. These video games are played with one&apos;s eyes, instead of a mouse or a touchscreen. By combining the gaze-driven aspect with embedded training principles, the games are uniquely effective in training attention. Attention is a foundational cognitive skill that is essential for academic success, much like reading is foundational to learning other subjects. The proposed project will result in a stand-alone system for elementary and middle schools to use in both special education and standard education programs for training attention control in children with attentional focus challenges. This product is particularly applicable for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and those with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), because their academic performance suffers from their attentional challenges. A key technical innovation for this project is the development of a suite of assessments that provide feedback on student performance on par with validated laboratory assessments of attention. The in-game assessments will be validated against the laboratory standards. At the end of this project, the suite of intervention and assessment games will be ready to deploy for testing in school settings as part of a SBIR Phase II project. Attention skill lies at the foundation of cognitive control and one&apos;s ability to scaffold successful classroom learning, yet existing laboratory tools to accurately measure attention&apos;s many facets are out of reach of the teachers and educators on the frontlines. This SBIR Phase I project brings innovation to the standard methods of attention assessment by creating easy to use assessment tasks that attract the attention of school children and whose validity will be compared to gold-standard lab assessments. This will make accurate assessment of attentional function more reliable even when delivered without an assessment expert present, and this project opens the market for attention training games that can show unbiased, quantitative improvement. This innovation will be broadly useful to allow a wide range of individuals to assess attention, but this specific project seeks to commercialize lab-quality attention intervention games for use by educators in schools with a software suite featuring interleaved assessment and training. This approach will provide feedback for school staff as well as ensure that the next steps in attention training are appropriate for the learner&apos;s current skill.

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the creation of flexible passenger identification displays for ride-hailing and automotive applications. This is a distinct pain point as many drivers choose the same model cars. Our first application is to solve ride-hailing passenger identification, but this becomes more critical with autonomous vehicles -- the only method of visual communication between an autonomous car and its target passenger will be via display. By helping to enable autonomous fleets of service vehicles, our displays will impart significant societal benefits, including reduced emissions, improved mobility for the elderly and disabled, and fewer traffic accidents. Beyond automotive, researchers estimate that in 2017 there are 20 billion devices connected to the Internet that are not computers, growing to 125 billion by 2025. These will influence many areas, including health and wellness, factory production, public safety, retail, agriculture, homes, and offices. They will enable better resource allocation, predictive maintenance, operations management, worker training, task automation, energy management, and safety. Not all of these ?Internet of Things? devices need displays, but those that do use them for input and information relay ? the exact uses for which our displays are designed. The proposed project will develop roll-to-roll printed passive matrix OLED (PMOLED) display technology. PMOLED displays are built upon a patterned transparent conductive anode that defines the pixels. To date, the only method used in industry to create this anode is photolithography. This is a slow and expensive batch process, but it is the only method that can produce the required results. Our high-resolution printable anode replaces both the incumbent material and the lithographic process to create a continuous roll of plastic covered in OLED anodes that can be loaded into a printing press. This lays the foundation for fully printed displays, fabricated using flexography, the same technique used to print newspapers. Through this work, we will produce fully printed PMOLED display prototypes. These thin, flexible displays will have extremely high contrast while using only 20% of the power required by a backlit LCD, with wide viewing angles for easy readability and flexibility to conform to any surface. If successful, we will be able to print displays 1000 times faster than the industry standard throughput while reducing materials waste by 80%. Such cost savings will make our displays the obvious choice for information display use, especially in design-driven applications.

It is projected that the human population will exceed 9 billion by 2050. To meet the expected demand, global food production must increase by more than 50% by 2050. This SBIR project will have impact not only in expanding fundamental knowledge of plant utilization of water but also in contributing to agricultural productivity, an urgent and practical need for human survival, in a sustainable manner. This SBIR Phase I project proposes to commercialize the advanced water-treatment technology that could enhance plant growth, and therefore improve crop output in agricultural applications. In short, a thin layer (about 100 microns, as thin as a human hair) of interfacial water was found to exist with a slightly higher pH, net negative charge, and a tendency to exclude impurities. These findings were similar to those found by other independent research groups working with xylem cells in plants and muscle cells in animals. Several hydrogels and polymers were also found to contain interfacial water with similar properties. Initial studies regarding the practical use of the interfacial water were conducted in a plant system. On average, initial results show a rapid growth rate of around 10% to 20% improvement compared to the control group; preliminary findings that have now been confirmed to be similar amongst four different plants, namely chick pea, wheatgrass, basil, and pea shoots. This SBIR will enable continued testing and scale up the interfacial water generator to meet water demands for customer validations.

This project will advance from creatively assembling existing active optics hardware to inventing a new microfiber-based active optics system to circumvent limits of space confinement and 3D resolution. The project&apos;s fundamental strategy for identifying pre-cancers of the cervix, which relies on a macroscopic 3D digital analysis combined with microscopic cell evaluation, is naturally amenable to artificial intelligence technologies. The versatility of this imaging platform enables the resolving of medical diagnostic challenges in wealthy settings and the resolving of cost-saving barriers in resource-limited settings. The imaging technology can be extended beyond medical practice to other scientific and industrial disciplines. Potentially, this project has an immediate impact on saving lives and costs via the early detection of fatal diseases. Additionally, the data and knowledge acquired developing and implementing this imaging system provide opportunities to meaningfully develop new computational strategies for educational, engineering and industrial interests. The innovative, commercially viable, platform technology offers opportunities for significant, tax-revenue-generating global profits, for future technology application spin-offs, and for producing high technology jobs for U.S. citizens. The project innovation will voyage from state-of-the-art 3D software development to the creation of a new type of fiber bundle imager with an electronically controlled actively focusing lens. Combined, these tasks achieve the creation of a miniaturized 3D imaging system capable of navigating confined spaces within the body, such as inside the cervix opening. For all prototypes developed for this project, final 3D renderings are enabled by proprietary 3D rendering software, capable of quantifying tissue color, volume and shape at the macroscopic level, while also evaluating cell size and approximate shape at the microscopic level. In wealthy settings, this system would be desirable for implementing a single-phase cervical cancer screening strategy to replace the current two-phase approach, which requires Pap smear and\/or human papilloma virus assay, followed by the more expensive colposcopy in the case of an abnormal result. In resource-limited regions and\/or regions with difficult-to-reach populations, where it is challenging to get patients to return for a follow-up visit, the technology would offer a low-cost, pre-screening method that only requires a single visit. This 3D imaging system could be combined in the future with a therapeutic agent administered at the time of diagnosis, thus offering a single-visit, screen-diagnose-and-treat method. This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercialization potential of this project is to address the need for a small, low-cost, and high-accuracy angular rate and angular orientation sensor (also known as a gyroscope) for a wide range of applications. Gyroscopes are desired by many emerging applications such as inertial measurement units for small satellites such as CubeSats, autonomous vehicles, drones, and high-end wearable electronics. These applications require a gyroscope with a similar price (&lt; $10) but ~10,000 times better accuracy than those currently used in smartphones. The birdbath resonator gyroscope (BRG) is a novel micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) gyroscope with a strong potential to satisfy the needs of these applications due to significantly better resonance quality and mechanical symmetry than current silicon gyroscopes. The economic impact of BRGs will be enormous since many industries can utilize high-performance gyroscopes to monitor the dynamics of their systems, provide positional awareness, and improve the performance of other parts of these systems. Availability of low-cost and high-performance gyroscopes will enable users to further understand their applications and explore their limits and applicability across a broad range of societal needs. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a new batch-level microfabrication technology to enable the commercialization of low-cost, very high-performance MEMS gyroscope from fused-silica. Gyroscopes available today are either accurate but large and expensive (example: hemispherical resonator gyroscope), or small and cheap but inaccurate (example: smartphone gyroscopes). High-accuracy silicon MEMS gyroscopes in research are small and accurate but expensive. This is because silicon has fundamentally low mechanical resonance quality factor (Q) so it is difficult to manufacture high-accuracy gyroscopes with a high yield. The BRG is a gyroscope made from fused-silica and capable of having low cost, small size, and high performance. Its fused silica micro mechanical resonator can achieve significantly higher Q than silicon, which allows the BRG to be manufactured with a high yield. The BRG fabrication process uses a blowtorch to reflow-mold a fused silica substrate into three-dimensional hollow shells with dimensions of several 10s of micrometers to several millimeters with high geometrical accuracy. The proposed research will significantly enhance our understanding of the relationships among size, design, and process on the performance of the BRG as well as the relationship among detailed process parameters, yield and reproducibility on cost.

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this project focused on a novel seat design that reduces vehicle-based whole-body vibration and shock will 1) better protect human health while 2) addressing major transportation markets including trucking, agriculture, construction, military vehicles, and mass transit, as well as automobiles and water-\/land-based recreational vehicles. The envisioned socio-economic impact is significant: Continual exposure to whole-body vibration and shocks can cause discomfort, reduction in work performance, and chronic low-back pain for vehicle operators and passengers. Low-back pain is the largest component of disability among all occupational-related injuries. Though so-called &quot;active&quot; seats can help reduce these vibrations\/shocks, their high cost is a major barrier. The low-cost seats being pursued here could benefit millions of vehicle operators. The work will also result in a greater scientific and technological understanding of the sources\/effects of and potential remedies for whole-body vibration and shock. The suspension system market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 5.11%, by value, from 2016 to 2021. The market is expected to grow from USD 52.38 Billion in 2015 to USD 67.22 Billion by 2021. The market for bus seats alone is expected to be at $10.03 Billion by the year 2022. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is focused on the feasibility of a quasi-semi-active seat (QSAS) technology. Seating design for heavy equipment and vehicle operators has faced a trade-off between performance and cost. The most-complex &apos;active seats&apos; reduce vibration but are cost-prohibitive at $3,500. Semi-active seats are simplified active seats and perform better than passive seats, but still magnify input vibration and cost several thousand dollars. Passive seats are the least expensive, but they magnify input vibration at low frequencies. Recent design\/material advances and strong preliminary data set the stage for developing an innovative passive seat at a fraction of the cost of semi-active seats that will reduce input vibration at low frequencies. Phase I feasibility will be shown using sliding friction to mitigate vibration at low frequency. A QSAS prototype will be built and used to show potential in laboratory and field settings. Technical challenges will involve material selection that will show maximum vibration mitigation and dissipation, as well as integration of the cushion with a suspension system that can handle the weight of a seated person. The research will determine effective performance parameters under different magnitudes and frequencies of vibration that simulate realistic operational conditions.

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I is the improvement of public transportation services for people with disabilities, specifically people with visual impairments. Individuals with visual impairments are heavily dependent on public transit as an essential service for engaging in daily life and social activities. However, they often face challenges with (1) determining which bus to board, especially at busy bus stops when multiple buses approach, and (2) boarding the correct bus in a timely fashion before they leave the stop. By developing an advanced notification service for alerting bus drivers, SeeingBus will address the societal and market needs to mitigate these challenges and thereby promote independent use of public transportation among people with visual impairments. Improving accessibility of public transportation to people with disabilities along with enhancing perception of their service will boost ridership resulting in increased revenue for agencies. The project will contribute to the scientific community as well as society in general by advancing understanding of Smart City services needed for independent travel of people with disabilities. The proposed project will develop and commercialize a Smart City service to improve public transportation for people with visual impairments. The service, SeeingBus, provides an advanced notification to bus drivers about users waiting at their next stop. People with visual impairments often miss buses due to challenges they face with boarding the correct bus. SeeingBus aims to improve accessibility of public transportation by engaging bus drivers even before the bus arrives at the stop where riders with visual impairments are waiting. As part of the smart city vision, SeeingBus will enhance connectivity of public transportation systems through greater communication between riders, bus stops, and bus drivers by means of smart sensors. Using big data, SeeingBus alerts bus drivers about users with disabilities, so the drivers can assist individuals in boarding the bus safely. The research objective of this project is to develop and test the feasibility of the SeeingBus system. Advancing public transportation, essential to promoting the travel and independence of individuals, aligns with the NSF mission to advance prosperity and welfare through scientific advancements.

Single-cell analysis, or the ability to decipher cell-to-cell heterogeneity, is a limiting factor in biotechnology and clinical applications. This project aims to further develop a transformative platform technology for integrated single-cell analysis capable of addressing existing challenges with the current state-of-the-art. The platform will potentially shift the paradigm of drug development and manufacturing, enabling quick iteration and evaluation of new therapeutic compounds. This approach could significantly reduce the time and cost to bring new drugs to market and reduce the overall cost of treating patients, which is a substantial benefit to society. Beyond this initial application, this single-cell analysis platform could become a readily implemented research tool, enhancing our basic understanding of biology, facilitate engineering of cell function, as well as evaluating safety and efficacy of new drugs and treatments. This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a robust and cost effective commercial prototype technology platform for integrated single-cell analysis. A key feature of the platform technology is the unprecedented sensitivity in measuring quantitatively secreted molecules from single cells. This is achieved by incubating single cells in extremely small volumes, and enabling analytics on an unprecedented scale in these microscopic bioreactors. The proposed work will lead to the development of a consumable prototype microfluidic chip, enabling quick and resource efficient adaptation of the platform to the marketplace. The proposed prototype will be validated through relevant studies, addressing a confirmed market need in cell line development. Commercial adaptation of this prototype will potentially provide deep insight into biological and physiological processes on a single-cell level, and transform drug development and manufacturing, therapeutic treatment, as well as clinical diagnostics.

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase I project will develop a very long-acting buprenorphine formulation to increase patient compliance and address the opioid crisis. Poor medication compliance is a significant driver of health care costs. The US would save an estimated 290 billion dollars yearly or 13% of the total health care budget if patients took their medications as directed. Patients with chronic diseases are the least compliant with medication. There is an evolving consensus that Opioid Misuse Disorder (OMD) is also a chronic disease, and its treatment is also plagued by poor compliance. There are an estimated 2.5 million people in the United States with OMD. Complete abstinence therapy fails about 80% of the time. Medication-assisted therapy using methadone, naltrexone or buprenorphine is far more successful. More opioid misuse patients are treated with buprenorphine than methadone, and retention in treatment is up to 78% with additional counseling. Still, 80% of all people who misuse opioids never obtain any therapy for their disorder, risking overdose, other diseases, including HIV and Hepatitis, and amyloidosis. Extended-release medications for opioid maintenance therapy would open up more options to get people into therapy. A 3-month release formulation of buprenorphine would be a part of that strategy. Buprenorphine is a partial agonist opioid drug that is used for treatment of pain in human and animal patients and for opioid addiction maintenance. A platform technology has been developed that can be used to formulate extended-release preparations of drugs that are weak bases and are mildly lipophilic. Preparations of buprenorphine, naltrexone and doxycycline have been developed using this method. The initial proposed product is an injectable formulation of buprenorphine that releases over a period of 3 months. This project will address the occurrence of a brief peak of early drug release in the 3-month duration buprenorphine formulation. The experiments in the current proposal will examine three different methods of decreasing the early peak by manipulating the amount of lipid engulfed by macrophages at a given dose of drug or by preventing macrophage engulfment of the lipid particles entirely by coating the lipid particles with chemicals that make them unlikely to be phagocytized. Preliminary results indicate that changing the drug to lipid ratio as described in the current proposal will reduce the peak of early release. Reducing the early peak will prevent sedative effects, improve the pharmacokinetics of the preparation and make dose escalation studies easier and more straight forward.

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to further the development of a patent pending technology aimed at producing flexible, lightweight, and low-cost semiconductor substrates. These flexible semiconductor films represent the next evolution of the silicon wafer, the foundation of over 90% of today&apos;s electronic devices, including computer chips, solar panels, microelectronics, and a wide range of sensors and similar &apos;internet of things&apos; devices. The silicon wafer, in its current form, is essentially unchanged since its inception over 60 years ago. These wafers, although larger today, remain thick, rigid, fragile, and are limited to circular forms no larger than 450 millimeters (18 inches) in diameter. The ability to produce large-area, high-throughput quantities of this material, in a flexible, more durable format would be truly disruptive, and help to usher in the next generation of affordable, flexible, and pervasive electronic devices. Accelerating the commercialization of this &apos;wafer 2.0&apos; will help to shape America&apos;s high-tech semiconductor manufacturing industry for the 21st century. The proposed project will focus on the development of this innovative technology at a simulated roll-to-roll prototyping scale, to enhance film crystal quality, repeatability, and electronic properties, while preparing the process for integration into large scale manufacturing. To date, no techniques exist that can produce large-area, highly crystalline silicon or other semiconductor films, that are suitable for high-throughput manufacturing. The technique in this proposed work is a novel, patent pending process, suitable for high-throughput roll-to-roll manufacturing and has several technical advantages that favor high-uniformity crystallization. Low-cost, flexible, wafer-like substrates will open the door for a wide range of electronic devices and fully integrated system-on-chip designs, including sensors, displays, lighting, processors, memory, microelectronics, and photovoltaics. Specific research activities will include optimization of the crystallization process via exploration of operating parameters; improvements and refinements to the prototype chamber equipment; evaluation of intermediate thin-film layers to provide ideal electronic properties and to promote more favorable recrystallization; and, finally, characterization of the resulting semiconductor films using state of the art semiconductor tools at the world&apos;s largest nanotechnology focused institute. This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to provide the capability to affordably and reliably connect underserved or unserved Americans to high speed internet using surface-mounted optical fiber, whether they live in a suburban neighborhood or in a remote rural area. The lack of high speed internet access is largely due to an inability to economically distribute broadband communications over the &apos;last mile&apos; to businesses, homes, schools, and medical or government entities. An understanding of the installed durability of fiber using this technique will usher in new developments to deploy surface-mounted fiber nationwide. More accessible high-speed internet provides more information, opportunity, and economic productivity regardless of the locale. The digital divide between urban and rural Americans could be reduced or eliminated. Lower cost fiber deployments will make it easier to deploy new technologies, like 5G antennas and connected vehicles, and will shrink the cost to make cities smarter with ubiquitous sensors and cameras. The proposed project will demonstrate that optical fibers under protective coatings bonded to paved surfaces can provide reliable high speed communications while subjected to weather and traffic. It will allow estimation of the predicted life time of surface mounted fiber on pavement. The testing will place asphalt samples in an environmental test chamber to evaluate competing fiberoptic installations and to identify the best performers for a series of follow-on field and lab tests. This will allow the future targeting of financial resources on the most promising material and profile combinations. Test samples will undergo wide ranging temperature and humidity cycles and repetitive tire impacts under controlled conditions. This testing will identify statistical life predictions in years after only a few months of actual test time. The longer the predicted life, the larger the customer pool, and the wider the potential market penetration. Understanding the predicted lifetime of a fiber installation will open the door to more early adopters, to more pilot program users, and eventually to fiberoptic installers and long term customers.

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is an inexpensive handheld smartphone device for rapid detection of the toxigenic cholera pathogen in environmental water sources. Contaminated water sources place populations at risk for contracting cholera. Once contracting the disease, patients with cholera exhibit symptoms of diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration and, if left untreated, ultimately death. Wide-scale cholera outbreaks devastated Haiti in 2010 and Yemen in 2017, affecting over one million total individuals. Currently, methods used to detect the cholera pathogen in water involves a 3 to 5-day water collection and cell culture procedure. This project proposes a portable smartphone platform used to detect the cholera pathogen, Vibrio cholerae, in under 30 minutes at the water source. Smartphone connectivity, will also enable geomapped and time-stamped detection results. This novel and proactive approach for detection can enable organizations to remediate water sources prior to communities contracting and spreading cholera. Downstream, this technology will save the time and costs currently associated with cholera outbreaks and can be expanded to other infectious diseases. This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a rapid, cost-effective, and robust smartphone platform to detect Vibrio cholerae and automate the detection result at an environmental water source. The device performs isothermal DNA amplification assay combined with the novel sensing approach, particle diffusometry. This project proposes to characterize the specificity, sensitivity, and lower limit of detection of Vibrio cholerae detection on the smartphone platform. The detection results will be compared against current gold-standard quantitative DNA amplification methods. Further, a reagent storage method involving freeze drying will be used to eliminate the need for cold-chain storage. We will assess the long-term stability of our assay reagents through accelerated aging studies. Lastly, a low powered integrated heating unit will be designed to perform the isothermal DNA amplification assays in the handheld device. At the completion of this Phase I project, an integrated smartphone platform will be ready for field testing.

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase I project focuses on the development and demonstration of a new high resolution X-ray detector to be utilized (initially) in medical diagnosis. The early work by NGS Detectors and collaborators has shown an improvement in resolution by a factor of almost 10 over the X-ray detectors in current use. The focus of this Phase I project is to now improve both the resolution and efficiency of the detector (in order to reduce the x-ray dose received by patients). The initial diagnostic application is for mammography, where the improved resolution is expected to allow accurate diagnosis of suspicious features in the breast at an early stage, while reducing the false diagnoses (both positive and negative) that are recognized to be problematic. The detectors have potential application in other medical diagnostics situations, such as neonatal and cardiovascular fields, where the higher resolution is expected to extend the application of X-ray diagnostics well beyond current practice. Applications for industrial nondestructive evaluation in fields such as semiconductor manufacturing are also envisaged. This SBIR Phase I project focuses on the development and demonstration of a new high resolution X-ray scintillation detector. The indirect detector utilizes a new polymeric scintillating polymer developed by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories for security applications, and incorporates the material into an optical channel plate. The optical channel plate contains an ordered array of high quality capillaries (e.g. 10 micron diameter). The scintillating polymer absorbs X-rays, and emit photons that are channeled to pixels of an optical detector with minimal scattering. A resolution of 10 micron has already been demonstrated, an improvement of nearly an order of magnitude over both direct and indirect detectors in current use in medical diagnostics. The focus of Phase 1 is to complete the detector characterization, with a special emphasis on improving the detector efficiency in order to minimize X-ray dose rates for patients. The successful completion of Phase I will lead to a Phase II that demonstrates that the higher resolution indeed yields higher feature discrimination in realistic diagnostic situations.

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this project is to maximize the quality of life of patients currently suffering from Parkinson?s Disease (PD). Over 1 million Americans have been diagnosed with PD and this number is expected to double by 2040. PD is a neurodegenerative disorder without a cure ? once the first Parkinsonian tremor has been detected, over 80% of the brain cells associated with creating dopamine through natural processes have already died. Dopamine is a chemical released by neurons to communicate with other nerve cells and is essential to enable the basal ganglia network to control the body?s movements. By engaging the PD patient with novel, highly-cognitive mobility exercises designed by physical therapists (PTs), automaticity can be reprogrammed to utilize different regions of the brain to control movement. Ultimately, this rewiring will slow (neuroprotection) or possibly reverse the degenerative process. Although the current technology development will focus on this one disease (PD), the technology may be applicable to other sister diseases (e.g., Alzheimer?s and Dementia) or even other conditions (traumatic brain injury, stroke, concussions, and so on). This computer-adaptive platform may eventually enable researchers to identify a biomarker that may lead to a cure for this idiopathic condition. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will produce a prototype for an automated physical-therapy (PT) treatment for patients suffering from Parkinson?s Disease (PD). This automated prototype will act as a virtual coach encouraging patients to perform daily mobility exercises in the comfort and privacy of their own homes. This unique, automated technology will help rewire the brain of the PD patient by engaging both the mind and body which will slow the neurodegeneration inherent to PD. The system will automatically adjust the treatment protocol in terms of duration and difficulty based on the patient?s unique situation including current medication levels. Objective, technology-based outcome measures will be summarized for caregivers working with the PD patient (primary care provider, physical therapists, neurologists, and so on). In addition, this technology platform will be designed to enable community interaction among PD patients as well as facilitate tele-health communications between the PD patient and his\/her healthcare provider. The overall objective is to develop a PD-specific electronic system that directs PT treatment by developing hardware\/software to test the feasibility of the adaptive assessment and the automated PT treatment system.

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to make non-pharmacological treatment of depression accessible to all patients. According to the World Health Organization, 350 million individuals are affected by depression. In the United States, depression affects 16 million people and it costs $210 billion a year in lost productivity and care for the illnesses related to the disease. Antidepressant drugs are coupled with negative side effects and they are ineffective in 30% of the cases. Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) is an FDA approved non-invasive method for depression therapy that consists in the administration of short electromagnetic pulses on patient?s scalp to stimulate regions of the brain involved in mood control. This SBIR Phase I project will help the generation of a new rTMS system that will improve outcomes of depression treatment by stimulating deeper brain cells and reducing the incidence of pain and discomfort associated with current rTMS therapy. The new device will allow broad distribution of rTMS based therapy for both professional clinicians and, in the future, home-care settings. It will avoid reliance on drugs to people affected by depression and it will reduce the impact of depression on society. The SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop and demonstrate the efficacy a new wearable rTMS stimulator device. Although rTMS has a 75% success ratio on depressed patients, 40% of subjects report pain, headaches and discomfort during therapy with current rTMS systems, resulting in a high dropout rate. This is mainly due to poor localization of electromagnetic pulses with commercially available rTMS devices. The new system will combine a new technology that stimulates the brain?s deepest regions involved in depression with unprecedented precision and a new protective shield designed to ward off unwanted heat away from the head, reducing scalp pain and discomfort. The project will develop and validate the efficacy of these components and their integration into a wearable helmet. The project will also demonstrate the superiority of the new device over current gold standard rTMS solutions. The company expects that this research will lead to the generation of a new device capable of treating depression patients through precise stimulation reducing over 40% the unwanted heat, thereby preventing headache and scalp discomfort. This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase I project will develop an extended depth imaging variation of optical coherence tomography (OCT). OCT is an optical imaging method that can visualize tissue structures up to 1mm deep with microscopic resolution. It has been well adapted for retinal imaging but although available for skin imaging application, the performance and price point are not sufficient to encourage market adoption. Building on NSF supported research at Duke University, this project will extend the depth range of OCT from the current 1-2 mm, which is only the most superficial layer of skin, to 3-4 mm, enabling full imaging of skin layers down to the dermal junction. This will enable dermatologists to access OCT without a large financial outlay and provide a non-invasive imaging modality in the office setting. Extended depth imaging is also applicable to dental imaging and may allow dentists to reduce the need for X-ray imaging by providing cross sectional images of teeth and gums. Since these OCT instruments are highly portable, the deep imaging system can be widely used, across lab benches, in the field or shared throughout a medical office. This project will support the development of new products and the teams that design and build them. Extended depth imaging OCT uses a novel design to dramatically increase the depth penetration of OCT into skin, teeth and other samples. By using distinct illumination and collection apertures, extended depth (or dual axis) OCT can triangulate the signal to layers deep beneath the tissue surface. Compared to previous OCT systems, this increases the imaging depth by a factor of 2. This innovation will be combined with proprietary spectrometer design, which was developed to take advantage of 3D printing methods, to develop a disruptive new instrument for imaging with the performance and price necessary for commercial success in clinical dermatology and dentistry. This proposal will build a prototype system and test it on several types of animal tissue.

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is the development of an effective and sustainable alternative to antibiotics and biocides used in animal feed, which will help mitigate the global health threat of multidrug-resistant bacteria. The beef cattle industry is under increasing regulatory and public pressure to reduce or eliminate the use of antibiotic feed additives as they are considered a major factor driving the proliferation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. However, in-feed antibiotics provide significant economic and animal welfare benefits to the cattle industry by reducing the incidence and severity of liver abscesses. This project provides an alternative for these conflicting concerns by providing a cost-effective alternative to in-feed antibiotics. Further, with sufficient understanding of how the rumen microbiome impacts animal physiology and performance, this technology could be easily adapted to selectively target microbial species that reduce animal growth or feed efficiency, or that produce methane, increasing the economic and environmental sustainability of livestock agriculture. This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a low-dose, bacteriophage-based feed additive that can be prophylactically administered to control the growth of pathogenic Fusobacterium necrophorum in cattle rumen. F. necrophorum is a causative agent of liver abscesses in grain-fed cattle, and antibiotics are currently added to feed to prevent its growth and limit abscess occurrence. However, in-feed antibiotics promote the proliferation of antibiotic resistant bacteria, and can cause undesirable off-target effects to the rumen microbiome. This research seeks to develop broad host-range (polyvalent) bacteriophages as an economical means of controlling cattle pathogens. Polyvalent bacteriophages will be isolated using specialized methods that select for those with a predetermined host-range based on rumen microbial composition. Each bacteriophage will then be characterized and tested for efficacy within a bioreactor operated to simulate the cattle rumen. Bacteriophage cocktails will be formulated and tested for their ability to minimize the development of bacteriophage resistance. The expected outcome of the proposed research is a library of polyvalent bacteriophages that can effectively control F. necrophorum under rumen-like conditions, and which will be further tested in animal studies.

It intends to develop a multi-question self-assessment tool to help individuals find meaningful purpose through free, online, live and self-paced hybrid course instruction. The coursework will use augmented reality and 3-D video to motivate individuals to re-think purpose as a central motivation to employment and entrepreneurship. This project aligns with the NSF?s mission to advance national health, prosperity, and welfare with science and technology. These outcomes could potentially generate a new generation of business owners that are dedicated to meaning and money through a double bottom-line approach to entrepreneurship. This project combines the educational work of finding purpose through self- help and the technology of 3-D video and augmented reality for the first time. This unique project provides free online live synchronous education combined with hybrid self-paced online course work to help individuals find meaningful self-employment solutions. This project utilizes a proprietary training method designed to quickly help individuals find their purpose in life and invent a useful business or nonprofit to solve problems in the world. This research can help students re-center their motivations to chart a meaningful life course through a business or nonprofit start-up. The curriculum starts with this activity and extends to provide students an opportunity to enter the marketplace through micro-enterprise or nonprofit creation. The courses will utilize predictive analytics to synthesize student data (such as the answers each student inputs for the four questions in the purpose activity). The data will be reorganized and automated into a clear and targeted purpose proposition statement for the student.

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is a 25% cost reduction in solar panel manufacturing and the elimination of up to 2.1 Gigatons of annual CO2 generation. As silicon wafers are the most expensive component in the $50BN solar panel industry, our low-cost wafer manufacturing technology presents the strongest opportunity to reduce global solar panel production costs. This cost reduction drives the compelling economics needed for increasing solar market penetration. As context, the solar market has historically doubled for every 20% cost reduction created by the industry. Our single crystal wafers are further significantly higher quality, and therefore can enable up to 10% higher effective efficiency using existing commercial solar panel manufacturing lines. Further, as the incumbent silicon wafer production process is extremely energy- and material-intensive and thus constitutes 80% of the solar industry?s carbon footprint, our direct and high efficiency technology has the potential to reduce the solar industry&apos;s 2026 carbon footprint by over 50%. The proposed project develops the systems needed for our process to produce silicon wafers with commercial dimensions and demonstrates to solar manufacturers (our customers) that our wafers can be processed by commercial solar cell lines. As our process produces a continuous ribbon of silicon, this work will develop a cutting system that laser cuts discrete wafers with the edges and dimensions needed for commercial solar cell processing. This involves developing the laser cutting recipes, the wafer handling systems, and verifying with a third party that the edge quality does not interfere with cell processing. Our project then investigates and optimizes our wafers&apos; performance during each critical step of commercial solar cell processing, including chemical etching and screen printing. A successful demonstration that our low-cost wafer can &apos;drop-in&apos; to an existing cell line to deliver equivalent (or better) performance compared to the incumbent technology would gate our working with industry partners to commercialize this process.

Overall, this project aims at offering an alternative technology platform to stabilize temperature sensitive biological materials at non-cryogenic temperatures. The intellectual merit of this project lies primarily in the approach used to achieve stable desiccated storage. The project aims at translating a newly developed drystate biopreservation processing methodology into a commercially viable, mechanized, long-term biopreservation technique.

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is the development of yeast fermentation technologies that enable conversion of sugars abundant in pectin-rich agricultural waste into useful specialty chemicals. The U.S. is a leading producer of pectin-rich agricultural wastes including citrus peels (&gt;5 million tons annually), sugar beets (&gt;37 million tons annually), and grape pomace (&gt;1 million tons annually). These peel and pulp byproducts lack value, however, the proposed technologies developed in this project will allow for significantly higher valued products to be produced from these waste streams. The initial target chemical product is used as a chelator in cleaning products and a precursor to plastics. Other chemical products potentially may be produced using this platform. Implementation of this fermentation process offers a lower carbon footprint and emissions compared to petroleum or even other sugar-derived products, and has impact in reducing waste and combating climate change. When implemented at scale, these fermentation processing plants will be co-located with rural agricultural processing plants, adding high-tech jobs in these areas, and offering a means to de-risk historically volatile crop harvests by accessing alternative markets. This SBIR Phase I project proposes to engineer yeast strains capable of converting sugars in pectin-rich agricultural wastes into valuable specialty chemicals. Currently, the fermentation rates for utilizing the primary sugar in pectin, D-galacturonic acid, limits production of these chemicals, including the proposed first product, which is a biodegradable metal chelator. Previous characterization has identified that uptake of the pectin sugars by a transporter as the limiting step. Accordingly, the first objective of this proposal is to characterize this class of transporter to identify new transporters with improved rates. The second objective is to improve the best transporter through protein engineering. Using this improved transporter, the final objective will assess the cellular energy requirements for the fermentation process using bioreactors to control fermenter conditions, as product synthesis and transport is energy-demanding. If successful, this project will enable production of specialty chemicals from pectin-rich agricultural waste. This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase 1 project will create an educational technology that accelerates the acquisition of foundational English language skills by children (4 to 10 years old), by melding English and Spanish language instruction, delivered via a personalized digital learning platform. Using state-of-the-art text-to-speech and speech-to-text engines, students that are English Language Learners (ELL) will engage in deliberate literacy practice across the four modalities of language (listening, speaking, reading, writing). Over the last decade, the number of ELL students enrolling in public schools has steadily increased while there remains a shortage of bilingual or certified ELL teachers. Technology can help these teachers to personalize instruction and extend the school day which in turn increases engaged learning time. Achieving college and career readiness is an economic imperative for all students, especially ELL students given the importance of English communication skills to career success. While developing technologies for use in classrooms by young children can be a risky proposition due to the nature of the modern classroom, the reward far outweighs the risk. This project will produce a high-impact technology solution designed for young children that integrates the latest text-to-speech and speech-to-text technologies and is grounded in sound research about language skill acquisition across the four modalities. The key innovation of this SBIR Phase 1 project is a plurilinguistic (e.g., Spanish and English) approach to literacy development across the four modalities of language (e.g., reading, writing, speaking, listening) where young students (aged 4-10 years old) are immersed in personalized learning experiences specifically tailored to support and accelerate language development. The first research goal is to test the feasibility for using and adapting proprietary English and Spanish language text-to-speech and speech-to-text engines with young children. The second research goal is to examine the impact of a dual-language personalized learning platform on children?s acquisition of foundational listening, speaking, reading, and writing skills. Participants will be ELL students whose first language is Spanish. The research is based on a plurilinguistic framework for second language acquisition; researchers hypothesize that a dual-language application that leverages students&apos; first language to learn English will score significantly higher on independent measures of foundational literacy skills and self-efficacy for learning compared to students who are using an English-only personalized learning application. A mechanism of growth may be the amount of time students are immersed in deliberate practice of literacy skills. A dual-language personalized learning platform has the potential to extend teacher-led literacy instruction and increase the amount of time students spend engaged in learning English. This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase I project will develop text, speech and image analysis technologies to transform a set of educational lecture videos into an interactive learning companion. A lecture video will be presented as a series of topically cohesive sections, each represented by a textual summary, a visual summary, and a video segment. Students will be able to query a series of lecture videos with the answers presented as a combination of text, images, speech with transcript, and video, along with links to additional relevant resources. These technological enhancements will drive the development of the lecture video management system with capabilities well beyond commercial state of the art. The students will gain the ability to instantly access any information in a semester long course, with little overhead for the instructor. The business plan focuses on a freemium model designed for wide adoption with no cost to instructors and a very low cost to students. The ultimate potential societal benefit is a significantly better learning experience and learning outcomes for higher education students. The key innovations in this project are summarization of video segments and a Questions &amp; Answers (QA) system customized for a series of lecture videos. These are formidable challenges despite existing substantial related research in text mining and image analysis. The information content of a lecture video spans multiple modalities, specifically, screen text, images, and speech. Further, each modality has unique characteristics. Screen text is typically unstructured and includes Optical Character Recognition errors. Transcripts from classroom lecture videos contain informal classroom interactions and suffer from speech recognition errors. The images in a lecture video can represent a variety of concepts including illustrative examples, graphs and charts, and camera images. Innovative approaches to topic modeling will be developed to handle the unique nature of the input compared to most documents. The project will employ representation learning approaches to map from each modality to a common semantic space that will drive the matching between student questions and the content of lecture videos. Since the best answer to a student question may not be fully contained in a lecture video, external resources including textbooks, message boards, and actual quizzes and exams will also be analyzed to drive the QA module.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will explore a novel materials processing technology that progresses the state-of-the-art of carbon fiber composites while leveraging mature and cost-efficient manufacturing methods. The processing technology of interest produces a material that approaches the isotropic properties of high-performance metal alloys while retaining the light-weight and stiffness of carbon fiber composites. Components that are fabricated from this new composite will have higher impact strength and reduced susceptibility to delamination, compared to commercially-available carbon fiber composites. The broader impact of this project includes providing engineers with a new tool to implement previously unfeasible designs that drastically improve performance while reducing energy consumption and material waste. The rapid adoption of carbon fiber composites in the wind energy, aerospace, and defense industries provides an opportunity for the novel material developed in this project to disrupt the $25-billion global carbon fiber composite market. Effective scale-up to industrial production of the novel carbon fiber composite can revitalize the Massachusetts textiles manufacturing ecosystem and increase the competitiveness of the U.S. advanced materials manufacturing base. The intellectual merit of this project is the continuous production of a three-dimensionally (3-D) reinforced carbon fiber prepreg that features a carbon fiber fabric reinforced with vertically aligned short carbon fibers. This novel material provides a laminated composite part with dense through-thickness and interlaminar reinforcement. Conventional carbon fiber laminates lack through-thickness reinforcement and rely on an unfilled polymer matrix to bind the layers of the laminate together, resulting in poor impact performance and frequent delamination. This project involves the roll-to-roll fabrication of 3-D reinforced carbon fiber prepregs and characterization of the produced composite material. The anticipated result of the project is the repeatable fabrication of a 3-D reinforced carbon fiber prepreg with enhanced performance compared to commercially-available prepregs. Successful completion of this project will enable further scale-up of the associated manufacturing technology and the commercial-launch of novel 3-D reinforced carbon fiber prepregs to produce stronger, lighter, and more durable composite structures.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses the challenges, inefficiencies and need associated with a rapidly growing precision glass optics market. Glass optics are currently used in a wide range of applications such as medical devices (scopes, diagnostics, imaging, etc.), defense (ballistic windows, missile domes, etc.), consumer electronics (cell phone lenses, smart device screens, etc.) and more. The challenge associated with this market is the constant need to prototype optical glass lenses during the development phase. Today, these glass lenses are prototyped using a combination of grinding and polishing processes that are costly and time consuming. The proposed (QET) Quad Element Technology could disrupt the glass optics industry, primarily the prototyping market estimated at about $300M with a rapid growth of 50% per year. The end result would be the much quicker availability of cutting edge technology that utilizes glass optics. An example would be significantly improving the arthroscopic or endoscopic surgical tools that drastically minimizes patient trauma and recovery time during a surgical procedure or even enabling remote surgery for patients especially in third world countries. Other societal benefits will be directly realized through economic growth, providing a competitive edge, and improving product quality and profitability. The intellectual merit of this project is to enable an innovative high productivity approach to manufacturing optical quality glass. The objective of this proposal is to demonstrate proof of concept and determine the feasibility of combining four (4) distinct elements in a single machining process: mechanical, chemical, photonic and thermal. The proposed technology, termed QET (Quad Element Technology), is the first of its kind in machining processes to exploit the advantages of the four elements specifically for material removal. Till date, these four elements have been used consecutively in status quo machining processes but never concurrently. The ability of extracting and optimizing only the advantages of these four elements will enable a faster (6-8x) and cheaper (3-5x) precision manufacturing process to produce glass optics. The primary goal of the Phase I R&amp;D is to successfully select and optimize individual components for each of the four elements proposed and demonstrate a precision turning process on optical glass.

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project extends from years of research into the impact of Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs), and yet there is still no direct, field assay for toxic cells. The identification of HABs is critical to determine their patterns of occurrence, to protect water and food supplies, and to alert the general public when there is a problem. Harmful Algal Blooms are a world-wide fresh water, brackish water and marine phenomena that occur in every coastal and inland country and annually cause significant economic damage and take human lives. The detection of HABs and their toxins is currently completed by complex, expensive, and time consuming microscopic analyses that do not necessarily provide the critical and timely information that water quality mangers require. Raman spectroscopy provides a strong and distinct fingerprint of HAB cells and their toxins without the need for sample preparation, and can be used on-site at beaches, drinking water reservoirs, or within distributed networks of Raman sensors all communicating through the cloud to provide managers immediate and spatially distinct information on the presence and concentration of potentially toxic cells. This STTR Phase I project proposes to develop and market an in-situ 3D microscope with on-axis Raman spectroscopy to provide both morphological information and a chemical signature for identification of HAB cells to species, and in some cases specific strains, along with the presence and concentration of toxin on a per cell basis. The novel technical specifications include: 1) the use of Light Field (LF) microscopy to maximize the depth of field to allow for detection of low cell concentrations (&lt; 1 cell\/ mL). LF microscopy also provides a 3D image for more complete and accurate morphological assessment of cells and particulates, 2) Advanced software for color and texture feature extraction and classification of cells using Gabor wavelets and a novel color angle feature, which provide 100% classification accuracy in many cases, 3) the use of Resonance Micro-Raman Spectroscopy (RMRS) to collect spectral fingerprints on the inorganic and organic content of cells, particulates and dissolved compounds, and 4) the integration of these technologies into sensor packages as part of the IoT cloud computing thrust that is sure to gain traction over the next few years, and will provide regional protection of both large and small drinking water reservoirs, globally.

Additionally, researchers in science and engineering can reduce the runtime of their applications by hours or days on the machines inside high performance computing or data centers, enabling more scientific modeling and simulations to be completed within these centers, while allowing each individual scientist to concentrate more on his\/her research, which in turn may more quickly benefit society. For example, in the defense industry, many contracting companies develop Monte Carlo simulation software to predict outcomes from disasters. Increasing the throughput of these simulations would allow for more simulation results to be analyzed and tested, thereby resulting in better predictions and handling of disastrous situations. This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is unique in its automated connection between existing performance modeling and prediction tools, and pattern-driven compiler optimization. Novel runtime monitoring and modeling techniques will be developed to automatically map performance bottlenecks discovered by existing performance analysis tools to potential opportunities of source code optimizations. Such opportunities again will be used to guide pattern-driven compiler optimizations, particularly to enhance the performance of finite element methods on both GPGPUs and multi-core\/many-core CPUs. Deep learning neural networks will be used to automate the runtime behavior classification of computations. The new pattern-driven specialization of compiler optimizations will enable general-purpose compiler techniques to be aware of the higher-level semantics of library abstractions (e.g., data structures and algorithm abstractions) and allow them to be collectively customized and coordinated to attain the best performance.

One of the main obstacles hindering the application of these models in other areas is the lack of structured data. By extracting information from sources such as web pages, blogs and social media messages, and storing it as structured data, companies will be able to take advantage of the vast amount of unstructured data that are generated daily and thereby improve their bottom line. (2) As the Chinese economy expands and becomes more deeply intertwined with the US economy, many US businesses will need high-quality and timely information about Chinese markets. However, information extraction from Chinese text is an underserved area. The proposed product can fill this void and thereby meet a significant commercial demand. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a new information extraction (IE) method. Currently IE focuses on information extraction from short text snippets consisting of a few words in order to derive structured factual information from unstructured text. But its performance is often deteriorated by the shortage of features - the sparse feature problem. A major benefit of the approach developed in this project is that it takes advantage of the important role of specific linguistic units even when the number of words in a sentence is limited. These linguistic units give a sentence its structure. Depending on structural characteristics or functional principles of sentences, the features around them are grouped. The grouped features satisfy certain properties and can be used to capture structural and semantic information, which is helpful for minimizing the sparse feature problem. This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is the reuse of rubber compounds from spent tires in high performance products including new tires without significant loss in product performance. Only a very small portion of those tires are currently being ground up for this purpose because of the detrimental impact on product properties. However, larger quantities could potentially be used if the ground rubber is treated by the process of our invention. This would have several benefits. Manufacturers could reduce material cost, the rubber recycling industry would enjoy significant growth and unsightly tire dumps with associated pollution problems would disappear. Additionally, the tire industry will become more sustainable and other unacceptable uses of old tires currently practiced, such as their use as fuels in low cost operations, would be financially challenged as novel, more profitable uses that retain the integrity of the polymer matrix emerge. This SBIR Phase I project proposes to build upon studies conducted by our company during the last few years. While it was widely known that recycled ground rubber will significantly reduce physical properties, limited information and understanding existed on the basic causes. Much hope was pinned by many companies and academic institutions on the potential merit of the ground up rubber but no significant commercial process previously emerged. This work aims to develop a recycling process which does not require a devulcanization step. This was first demonstrated with model sample geometries that simulate the environment which ground rubber particles experience when added to and being co-vulcanized with fresh rubber compounds. This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is a system that provides improved reservoir productivity through a novel, inexpensive, and environmentally friendly method. This method will use an electric impulse to increase reservoir permeability, and decrease industry reliance on alternative methods like hydraulic fracturing, which requires hazardous chemicals to be pumped into the subsurface. Residents in regions where fracking techniques are utilized have commonly been impacted by induced seismicity and landslides as a consequence of pumped in chemicals lubricating faults, making earth ruptures more likely to occur. Additionally, the material and operation time for reservoir stimulation techniques makes the current process expensive. The ability to increase permeability with an electric impulse will avoid the environmental concerns associated with current methods, and will proved a cost competitive reservoir stimulation solution due to a short operational time. This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a novel low-frequency impulse method (LFIM) that increases reservoir permeability for petroleum and geothermal applications, without requiring pumping of material into the subsurface. Fluid mobility is increased due to viscosity reduction and reservoir permeability is increased in the direction of interest from the vibrational removal of particles within sediment pores. This program will 1) simulate the processes taking place in the reservoir using computer simulation model, 2) perform experimental analysis of the effects of the electric treatment on different core samples, and 3) determine applicability of the method to different types of the reservoirs located in the United States. Therefore, this project will identify the optimum sites, where LFIM can boost geothermal performance and oil &amp; gas production.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project scales the production of renewable monomers that give access to performance nylon polyamides with tailorable functional properties for applications in the automotive, food &amp; beverage packaging, textiles, and other industries. The revolutionary technology will be a disruptive force to the $40 billion nylon polyamide industry by addressing nylon?s weaknesses such as undesired moisture adsorption, which results in loss of dimensional stability and tensile strength. These shortcomings lead industries to make compromises in selecting their materials; for instance, longer chain polyamides are used for moisture resistance but at the expense of desired viscoelastic properties. The proposed bio-advantaged monomers will 1) help ease reliance on petroleum-based chemicals resulting in greener production processes and a cleaner environment, 2) present new opportunities for innovation and use of performance plastics due to the platform that bio-advantaged monomers offer. This is expected to generate new jobs at multiple points in the value chain. Demand for agricultural goods by fermentation facilities will increase. Sumatra Biorenewables and its partners will create jobs to meet demand for monomer production and purification. Finally, polymer producers and the manufacturing industry will produce superior products, increasing the competitiveness of the U.S. chemical industry. The intellectual merit of this project is to combine fermentation and chemical conversion for the production of bio-advantaged monomers and their corresponding performance-enhanced polyamides. The inexpensive, robust, and efficient monomer production process in conjunction with the customizable nature of bio-advantaged monomers to yield nylon derivatives that are hydrophobic, flame retardant, anti-static, or otherwise tailorable, afford opportunities to meet a number of needs in the manufacturing sector. The innovation?s success hinges on a monomer production process that utilizes an inexpensive electrochemical conversion that operates near 100% efficiency and that only uses water as a reactant and electricity as an energy source. In addition, the monomer production process is insensitive to the feedstock source and the impurities present in fermentation broths. Therefore, separation and purification is only required after monomer production, resulting in huge cost savings. Laboratory-tested samples of hydrophobic nylon perform equally well as dry nylon, but without the disadvantage of moisture sensitivity. This project will enable Sumatra Biorenewables to transition to a continuous flow, kilogram-scale, production process and supply potential customers with samples for performance testing.

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is the commercialization of a fermentation bioprocess that can bring significant benefits for the dairy industry - called the WheyAway system. By initially addressing the problem of handling acid whey, a waste stream generated by all Greek yogurt and cottage cheese producers - the WheyAway can convert the cost of waste handling into a revenue by producing valuable bio-oil platform chemicals. The WheyAway can economically convert the acid whey waste stream to bio-oil on-site, allowing our customers to effectively install biorefineries at each of their plants. In comparison to anaerobic digestion, the WheyAway system can provide several multiples greater economic value. These bio-oils can be used as biofuel feedstocks, animal feed additives, and specialty chemicals. Converting acid whey yields a significant market opportunity with projected impact that could simultaneously offset ~435,000 gallons of diesel used to truck this waste off-site and eliminate ~18,000 tons of greenhouse gases from being emitted to the atmosphere. In the future, this bioprocess can be tuned to address other dairy processing streams, allowing the WheyAway to provide value to stakeholders across the entire dairy production value chain. This SBIR Phase I project proposes to scale-up and optimize a novel fermentation bioprocess called the WheyAway system, and can economically convert acid whey waste into valuable platform chemicals, to provide value to Greek yogurt and cottage cheese producers. Plan is to scale to maximize bio-oil production and conversion efficiency through system optimization. A key focus will be to lower the capital cost for the extraction process. Through the tasks proposed for this SBIR, objectives to scale to a 5x larger reactor, lower operating expense by 20%, and lower the capital cost of the currently expensive bio-oil extraction process by 10x. Additionally, potential to convert other dairy process streams, such as sweet whey, will be evaluated, which could unlock larger opportunities in the dairy production value chain.

The proposed research and development phase will focus on the deployment and field testing of a collection of prototypes with partner locations, and examine their efficacy at engaging and informing visitors of those sites. The broader significance of the project is the development of an information device and ecosystem that gives the public a better understanding of notable places and the greater physical world. Deployments will be able to visualize a variety of site-specific data, from environmental conditions, to geological formations and landmark navigation. Potential revenue can be generated in partnership with locations, allowing for sustainable long-term engagements between the project and a site. Direct economic impact is brought to a location and its surroundings through increased foot traffic and the encouragement of additional exploration of a space. The innovation being proposed is stereoscopic wide-field-of-view see-through augmented reality viewers in the form of landscape binocular kiosks designed to give public spaces a way to engage visitors with the natural, scientific, and historic features of that location. In addition to displaying immersive media experiences optically overlaid onto a view of the real world, this project creates a distributed media network on that location to share data and content for remote viewing and analysis. Goals and scope of research include durability testing of the devices in prolonged public exposure, effectiveness of the user interface and software tools, understanding the range and bandwidth of device-to-device communication, and optimization of the optical, electromechanical, and sensor components. Methods and approaches will include the field testing of prototype units with partner locations, and using survey and analysis techniques to evaluate the overall quantitative and qualitative efficacy of the intervention at those sites.

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable more efficient access to information, goods, and services from organizations and businesses through conversational interfaces. With an estimated 33 million voice-activated devices installed in the U.S. by the end of 2017, consumers are beginning to see the benefits of the rise in business services on these devices. Interacting with computers in natural language is more efficient than ever before, and business are urgently seeking to include their services on this new modality. Yet, while advances in machine learning have increased the speed and accuracy with which conversational interfaces are built, today&apos;s solutions still result in major bottlenecks in the development process. Addressing these bottlenecks would result in significant savings of time and resources for businesses, in addition to increased convenience for end users. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project advances the development of machine learning and natural language processing technologies that will enable rapid creation of conversational interfaces and increase the efficiency with which individuals interact with computers. Despite major recent advances in conversational interface tooling, current bottlenecks in building robust conversational interfaces still exist, as portions of the development process go from highly-automated to manually-programmed. Instead, the proposed approach will achieve end-to-end automation using an innovative LSTM sequence-to-sequence machine learning model to learn and simulate human behavior on a web page, as well as a new system for open-domain question answering.

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to develop a software platform to automate the integration and analysis of large sets of biological data. This project will help lift the barrier that exists in data analysis and experimental planning by providing the latest computational advances in machine learning and bioinformatics. The goal is to create a cohesive data universe for microbial organisms, where each new dataset can be easily integrated, compared, and ultimately leveraged to increase collective knowledge. Such homogenized sets of structured biological data are ideal training sets for predictive models that can accelerate discovery times by transforming the traditional &quot;shot-in-the dark&quot; way of experimentation to guided, well-connected hypotheses, generated from the complete set of data at hand. This SBIR Phase I project proposes to build a software tool for automated hypothesis generation based on biological datasets. First, it will support the design of a novel multi-omics engine that will allow the creation of a cohesive compendium of the omics and interaction universe for microbial organisms. Second, it will lead to the development of predictive modeling tools that will interrogate and transform this data compendium into a semantic web of actionable predictions. Third, it will support the evaluation of novel active learning methodologies for omics data. This project will lead to a software architecture that can put all of these tools under one platform to empower commercial clients as well as the academic community. Once completed, the product will offer an automated, end-to-end environment and decision support engine fueled by the collective knowledge. In that sense, it will be a personalized experience on an ecosystem of pre- and post-processing services for biological data. This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop the process to 3D print continuous fiber reinforced ceramic matrix composite (CMC) components for turbine and combustion engines, hypersonic vehicles, and satellites. CMCs are currently a $2.5b market that is expected to triple over the next decade. The ability to produce CMCs with 3D printing will enable superior designs in current applications, as well as enabling their use in a greater number of components that are currently limited by the higher density and lower temperature capabilities of superalloys such as Inconel and Invar. Developing this manufacturing process will enable more basic materials research by serving as a lower cost testbed for new CMC compositions since a mold is not required and turnaround times are much faster. This will also allow engineers to develop more optimized systems with a faster design cycle. This capability will result in efficiency increases in turbine and combustion engines for substantial improvements in fuel efficiency, reducing costs and environmental impact. Finally, the ability to 3D print CMCs will vastly improve geometric complexity of high temperature components, which will enable the next generation of hypersonic vehicles, supporting national defense. The intellectual merit of this project is in establishing a novel manufacturing process for CMCs based on 3D printing. Melt infiltration is a low cost method to produce CMCs, which starts with a polymer matrix composite that is pyrolyzed, and then infiltrated with a molten metal. The matrix is usually a phenolic thermoset, but high temperature thermoplastics have recently been proven viable for simple coupons. This project will use 5-axis continuous fiber reinforced high temperature thermoplastic composites as green bodies. Since thermoplastics melt, support materials will be implemented during the pyrolysis step, which are effective in retaining part geometry. Additionally, a novel process of growing a boron nitride interphase layer on the fibers after pyrolysis instead of prior to forming the polymer composite will be implemented since tight corners during printing might damage an interphase layer. Finally, 3D printing with larger bend radius silicon carbide fibers instead of carbon fibers will be attempted. This project will demonstrate the effectiveness of this interphase with improved flexural strength and toughness, and the ability to form geometrically complex CMCs that are extremely difficult, if not impossible, to make with other methods. These two milestones will enable a path to begin developing parts for customers in commercial applications. This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The proposed product could be adapted to many industries including agriculture, mining, construction, marine water craft, chemical storage, military vehicles, and water storage. The proposed product will preemptively warn equipment operators of low lubrication levels thereby saving customers money from repairs or replacement of new systems. The proposed project will address the need of digitally monitoring oil lubrication levels while producing a highly accurate measurement in real-time. The solution will be non-contacting unlike current solutions that provide a single low-level alarm or rely on manual checks. The prototype will be put in a simulated as well as real-time environment to investigate endurance, accuracy, stability, longevity, reliability and ease of installation. Objectives include: (1) Find a solution\/configuration to accurately monitor rapid level changes; (2) Verify the hardware can withstand harsh conditions (extreme temperatures, high vibration); (3) Software testing; and (4) Analyze different reservoirs to see how the product can be easily mounted.

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to create sustainable and biodegradable polyurethane products made from algae oils. Algae-based polymer precursors will be developed and used to produce finished polyurethane product with the desired physical characteristics. Development of polyurethane shoe soles will be targeted, including polyurethane flip-flops, as these are products where consumers are increasingly demanding the incorporation of sustainable materials and where the consumer is willing to pay the small extra cost associated with incorporating renewable materials. Developing algae polymers and high value products made from these will allow us to develop a novel monomer toolbox based on these bio-materials and to create new polymers with physical properties equal or superior to petroleum based polymers. These algae based polymers also provide cleaner, smarter products- pollution prevention at the molecular level. The development of environmentally sustainable and biodegradable products will reduce waste, prevent costly end-of-life remediation, lead to safer products and save energy and water resources. The development of these algae based polymer products will enable renewable materials to supplant petroleum-based materials while maintaining the performance characteristics of polyurethane products that consumers have come to appreciate. This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop sustainable monomers from bio-based algae feedstocks that will be used to create finished polyurethane soft foams that have the appropriate properties for shoe soles. It incorporates the preparation of algae-based polyols from multiple algae oil sources, going from bench to production scale, followed by formulation of these monomers into materials that meet the demands of a discerning eco-conscious consumer. The developed algae polyols will not be formulaic direct drop-in replacements for the corresponding petroleum sourced materials&apos; careful formulation will be required to generate polyurethanes with the desired final product properties, and that are also compatible with current manufacturing techniques. Formulation and process compatibility are key steps, as industrial users are not looking to significantly modify manufacturing processes to incorporate new starting materials. Lastly, physical evaluation of the resulting polyurethanes will be done by comparing the performance metrics between bio and petroleum-based polyurethanes typically used by end users in sportswear and automotives. Using polyols derived from multiple algal strains, a polyurethane formulation for soft foams will be developed to demonstrate our ability to integrate product development and manufacturing, from sustainable feedstock and green chemistry through commercial application.

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is the introduction of an environmentally-beneficial filtration material and corresponding high performance, and long-lasting point-of-use water filter. The competitive advantages of the product are increased treatment efficiency, longer service life, and sustainable production at a similar price point to commercial products. The biofabricated advanced media filter results in sophisticated material properties and higher consumer value at a lower overall cost. The success of this Phase I project has potential for far reaching commercial impacts beyond consumer water filtration. By demonstrating the consistency of the metal impregnated filter material, commercial applications could be extended to the fields of emissions control, energy storage, and chemical production. In each of these fields, including water filtration, the new filter material would be replacing unsustainable materials derived from coal and coconut. These existing materials have significant environmental impacts associated with their production and transportation. This SBIR Phase I project proposed to use the efficiencies of biological organisms to produce high performance, economical, and sustainable materials for premium filtration applications. To achieve this goal, a biofabrication process has been developed that involves the controlled cultivation of fungi serving as a template for the production of advanced activated carbon. This bioprocess allows for precision control over the chemical and physical properties which can be easily customized for targeted applications. Using the process of bioaccumulation and biosorption, the fungi can be functionalized simultaneously with nitrogen heteroatoms and biogenic metals\/metal oxide nanoparticles. These in-situ functionalities greatly improve material performance, extension of water filtration service life (2X over state-of-the-art), whilst reducing overall energy consumption during manufacturing. While this process has been demonstrated on the gram production basis, the technical hurdles in this Phase I include scaling production to the kilogram level, providing critical material validation testing, and prototyping of a final consumer product. To execute these goals, growth conditions will be optimized in scaled bioreactors, industrial testing methodology will be employed, and a simple, yet high value water filtration device will be produced.

The potential outcomes of the proposed activity are the development of a thin reusable blue light-emitting bandage that provides effective post-operative site disinfection, ultimately reducing nosocomial related infections. The proposed activity would further the development of antimicrobial blue light therapy devices, providing novel solutions to surgical site infections, Central Line Bloodstream Associated Infections, and wound infections, because of blue light therapy&apos;s proven ability to inactivate a wide range of clinical pathogens regardless of their resistance to antibiotics, ability to improve wound healing, and ability to inactivate bacteria in the biofilm state. The outcomes of this project will aid in providing a cost saving solution to Healthcare Associated Infections by reducing their occurrence, reducing the risks of human error, and improving accountability, quality and workflow. Optimization of blue light therapy is needed for clinical application for killing bacteria on the surface of patient&apos;s surgical sites, because of a radiant energy threshold that must be passed to inactivate bacteria. Due to the variation in devices and doses used in previous studies, combined with the clinical need for a device which can be easily incorporated into standard infection prevention protocols, further experimentation is needed with a device designed as a wearable for clinical implementation. Objective 1: Determine optimal light dose (fluence) of blue light (405 nm) required to inactivate common gram positive and gram negative bacteria known to cause SSIs. Using in vitro techniques, determine the total fluence of light and treatment times required to achieve bacterial disinfection of at least a one log reduction in bacteria colony forming units. Objective 2: Optimize device to deliver the effective irradiance while maintaining surface temperature below 43 Degree Celsius for safe use on tissue. The device is to not exceed 43 Degree Celsius on the surface of the device&apos;s therapeutic surface while delivering effective irradiance, from Objective 1, for inactivation of bacteria on surfaces. Objective 3: Test the device&apos;s infection prevention and tissue response in a SSI porcine model. Evaluate the device in a porcine SSI model with surface-inoculated sutured incisions, made to the depth of the fascia, with optimized light-emitting antimicrobial bandage. Success criteria for bacterial disinfection is at least a 90% reduction of CFU per gram of tissue or a multiparametric and semiquantitative score (0-3 range) no greater than 1, based on standard subjective clinical markers, including fever, erythema, induration, and suppuration.

Scale-up of this technology will transform the large-scale purification of biopharmaceuticals and lower prescription drug costs - the most important factor contributing to rising healthcare costs. The major factor influencing the rising cost of healthcare is the skyrocketing costs of pharmaceuticals - up to 40% of the medical plan cost will be drugs by 2025. Prescription drug costs are the fastest rising component of healthcare and are contributing to the dramatic increase in healthcare costs. The worldwide focus of pharmacy and biotechnology is now on biopharmaceutical development and production to address this issue. Direct benefits of this project include low-cost, use of green reagents, and the absence of heavy metal impurities in the purified protein. In addition, the development of immobilized enzymes using this technology will open new frontiers in biocatalysis, biosensors, diagnostics and protein delivery. This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop protein purification kits for small-scale and research-scale research. Bringing these kits to market will enable researchers to further validate the technology on a broader range of proteins in preparation for scale-up for biopharmaceutical production. Synthetic biology has quickly begun to revolutionize drug discovery and design by providing a better overall molecular understanding of disease. However, this potential has yet to be fully realized due to the challenges associated with purifying the target recombinant protein from the thousands of naturally-occurring proteins produced by the expression system. The three specific aims of the project are: 1) validation of protein tag performance for multiple protein classes and expression systems, 2) development of low-cost methods for protein tag removal from purified proteins, and 3) development of solutions for the purification of low-expressing proteins and the parallel purification of small amounts of proteins.

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase 1 project aims to produce songs that are optimized for learning and memory. While music has long been recognized for its mnemonic properties (e.g., the ABC song, the 50 states song, etc.) and is widely used as a memory aid in the context of early childhood learning, music-based educational products for the broader K-12 market are rare. Music is unique in its ability to engage learners, make learning enjoyable, and transfer information into memory more readily. Yet, music is predominantly experienced as an entertainment medium. The goal of this research is to position music as a credible pedagogical tool by scientifically crafting songs that support the learning of critical academic skills and concepts - offering today&apos;s learners a relevant, effective and efficient medium for boosting learning outcomes. The technical innovation proposed is a scientific framework for mnemonically optimized music and songs. This research features two distinctive innovations: 1) isolation and identification of the mnemonic drivers of songs, and 2) operationalization of these drivers as parameters for the creation of songs optimized for learning. Methods employed include computational and statistical modeling, expert input, and behavioral measurement. The potential impact of this research addresses a pressing academic need -- how to teach students using pedagogy that is relevant, engaging and scientifically sound. If proven feasible, this research will fuel creation of a unique musical form designed specifically to enhance memory and learning, with application to K-12 learning and beyond. This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "abstract": "Broader Impacts: The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project include improving food security, while at the same time enhancing the economic viability and environmental sustainability of large-scale production agriculture. In order to improve crop varieties, agricultural production, and sustainability of farming, there is an urgent need for better technologies to acquire under-canopy plant trait and health data. Examples of high-value under-canopy data include emergence, stem width, corn ear height, plant life-cycle events like flowering and fruiting, and symptoms of pathogens, diseases, and nutrient deficiency. Because these data cannot be obtained by aerial imaging, under-canopy data collection has dramatically greater actionability and value compared to aerial data. However no cost-effective, scalable ways of collecting this data are currently available. In fact, the state of the art is manual data collection by crop scientists (and their students or interns), agronomists, crop-scouts or farmers - an extremely labor intensive, and therefore expensive way of collecting this highly valuable data. Our work will greatly enhance the availability of under-canopy data from field crops. The commercial value of the field data for crop breeding is in excess of $50 Million\/year for breeding major row-crops in the US. Intellectual Merits: This SBIR Phase I project will demonstrate the technical feasibility of autonomously collecting under-canopy data from field crops using TerraSentia, our low-cost ground robot. In preliminary work, we have built the robot hardware, demonstrated its ability to collect high-value plant data from row-crop fields, and analyze it to generate plant-trait information. In the proposed work, we will enable and demonstrate the ability of TerraSentia to collect data autonomously throughout the season. We will demonstrate the technical feasibility of fusing information from low-cost LIDAR, GPS, and vision. We will also demonstrate the feasibility using real-time control algorithms to adapt camera perspective and robot path in order to obtain the highest quality information from the complex and dynamic under- canopy field environments. These high-risk innovations will together enable long-term deployment of TerraSentia for effective data collection and phenotyping, benefiting crop scientists and agricultural product development professionals.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a novel process and platform for the aerosol synthesis of metal-oxide nanoparticles. When coupled with an existing aerosol deposition technology, this aerosol synthesis source will enable the production of the next generation of functional coatings. These include antireflective and self-cleaning coatings for solar modules, novel electrical contacts that reduce silver usage in solar cells, and thermal barrier coatings for windows that increase thermal efficiency. Each of these represents a large addressable market in need of coatings innovation: For example, the coated flat glass market is expected to reach $43.2B in 2025 and the metal-oxide nanoparticle coatings from this project are anticipated to capture at least 10% of that market. Beyond the commercial and related societal impacts of the project, this project will increase the scientific understanding of the nucleation of nanomaterials in the gas phase and the subsequent manipulation of nanoparticles in low-pressure flows. The intellectual merit of this project lies in its development of a new method to synthesize metal-oxide materials in the gas phase, resulting in an aerosol that can be manipulated and deposited on a substrate with gas flows. Prior art for the synthesis of metal-oxide nanoparticles and the subsequent formation of films suffers from three challenges: (1) synthesis methods that utilize high-pressure gas-phase processes tend to create large light-scattering agglomerates that produce hazy films, (2) &quot;wet&quot; synthesis coating techniques can suffer from stability challenges, optical non-uniformities, and processes that are not easily scaled and (3) all methods have limited control of the optical properties of the film, specifically the refractive index. Synthesis of metal-oxide nanoparticles using the approach in this project is a promising, but under-examined and under-utilized, technique. It will generate unagglomerated nanoparticles of controllable size, overcoming the first challenge, and, with suitable aerosol deposition techniques, enable large-area uniform films with controllable refractive index, overcoming the second and third challenges.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will evaluate the technical feasibility and commercial viability of a novel sample preparation method for cryo-EM (cryogenic electron microscopy) studies. As a rapidly growing technique in the structural biology field, the cryo-EM market as a whole is estimated to be more than $5 billion a year, with &gt; $500 million attributed to the sample preparation space. In spite of an overall revenue growth rate of more than 70% per year, cryo-EM sample preparation remains an area that has yet to see any major technological breakthroughs commercialized in the past decade. In fact, the current industry solution is reported to have a failure rate of &gt; 95%. By providing a sample preparation system that actually works, this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will significantly reshape the massive and rapidly expanding cryo-EM market and allow scientists to more readily collect detailed protein structures in their native state. This new knowledge on the molecular basis of cells and of life itself will be used to facilitate as well as accelerate the development of new pharmaceuticals as well as therapeutic treatments for diseases and thus greatly benefit human health in the long run. The intellectual merit of this project is the development of a cryo-EM sample preparation device built on the application of state-of-the-art microfluidic jet systems to deposit and vitrify protein solution on EM grids in milliseconds, which is at least 1000x faster than the current methods. Furthermore, it offers scientists the novel ability to control the thickness of the vitrified aqueous layer and, overall, more control over the sample vitrification process. With this new sample preparation device, a larger region of the cryo-EM grids will have intact protein molecules with the right layer thickness for structural determination, allowing researchers to save time and money in terms of both grid preparation and screening in a high-throughput manner. Currently, the proposed technology has not been tested nor used anywhere. Therefore, the first and foremost goal of this SBIR Phase I project is to better understand and well characterize the technical capabilities and limitations of this proposed innovation, with additional R&amp;D work needed before product commercialization, which is expected in five years. The project will focus on defining and optimizing both the geometric and experimental setup in order to de-risk the technology.

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase I project focuses on development of a prototype for a Virtual Music Helper (VMH) for children. Research confirms that music and music learning enhances intelligence, learning and IQ specially in kids. Even children with attention deficit\/ hyperactivity disorder benefit from listening to music beforehand in mathematics tests. Children who learn or practice music have shown better results in STEM subjects. However, studies also suggest children opt out of music class based on false belief that they lack musical ability and many kids often find the music practice non-engaging, and boring eventually losing interest and quitting. Parents find it challenging to entice the kids to sit down and practice or they cannot help their kids because either they don?t have time or are not music savvy themselves to help them. The virtual music helper can read the kids? music homework, guide them through the exercise and provide immediate correction. This helper is not to replace teachers, but help the parents at home and encourage kids to practice more. In broader terms this project may spur significant research in finding effective methods for tutoring kids in subjects other than music such as math or language, or for kids with special needs. This SBIR Phase I project proposes a Virtual Music Helper (VMH) that is empowered by Artificial Intelligence and Augmented Reality for kids. VMH is a 3D mobile-virtual-human (avatar) that can be personalized for each kid and conduct live dialog with kids both from visual and behavioral perspectives. VHM offers smart content for teachers about each student&apos;s progress and weak points. The technical challenges this project will address is the detection and correction of mistakes kids make including polyphonic pitch detection from acoustic instrument, conversion of note sheets to machine readable music format with high accuracy and speed, empowering the avatar with decision making algorithms to provide proper correction and feedback verbally and visually. This platform is also intended to support multiple popular instruments and multiple languages.

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to transform 2-way, mobile satellite communications from a niche service (affordable to less than 0.1% of the world?s people), to a broadly accessible mass market product (at costs well under $1\/month). Communications devices (that could be as small as vehicle key fobs) will communicate modest volumes of data to and from virtually anywhere on Earth. The number of potential applications is large, with the following being a few examples: every lifejacket on every commercial aircraft and cruise ship could transmit its location and status (in the event of a mishap); children and the elderly could be tracked globally; and drivers could be assured of assistance wherever they travel. Secondary impacts would include an increase in average fuel efficiency when, for example, more vehicles are sold without spare tires (as drivers have more peace-of-mind regarding the possibility of being stranded). The United States will benefit in terms of improved safety, conserved resources, stimulus to the satellite and related industries, and increased export revenues. The proposed project centers around a combination of innovations that exploit inherent (but previously unutilized) capabilities of existing satellites. Currently operational Mobile Satellite Systems have communications architectures that do not lend themselves to low-cost transmission of small volumes of data. By starting with a blank sheet of paper and rethinking the architecture, costs can be reduced by orders of magnitude (for both the communications devices and the data service). The cost reduction of the terminal devices is primarily driven by lower data rates (with associated lower power and size). While most technical aspects of communications links improve with lower data rates, one characteristic emerges as a constraint on the extent to which data rate can be reduced. The purpose of this research is to study this characteristic, called phase noise, and its impact on the communications performance at low data rates when using real satellite links. The results of this research will be quantitative conclusions regarding the trades between data rates, the cost impact of lowering phase noise in the communication elements, transmission performance, and the modem architectural options. This study will enable optimization of this trade when developing the follow-on commercial products.

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this project is the practical deployment of a low-cost and low-power real-time perception system in self-driving consumer cars. This edge computing functionality in sensors enables higher reliability and lower cost of overall sensing and computing needed for truly autonomous self-driving. Such innovation will contribute significantly to the early and widespread availability of safety and convenience benefits to consumers. Furthermore, the advanced perception system will have a potential long-term impact on robotics in general, which can lead to creation of new markets and new lifestyles. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop efficient algorithms and software implementation of a real-time perception system to enable the use of low-cost computing systems for self-driving cars. The algorithms provide a novel way of using image features to perform simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) with 100 times less computational costs than the existing algorithms. They also include a truly novel neural network to fuse the image feature and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) features and perform object detection, which has 100 times less complexity compared to the state-of-the-art method. These reduced-complexity algorithms can be implemented on low-power and low-cost SoC processors.

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is that it will enable small and mid-size robotics and industrial vehicle manufacturers to rapidly deploy computer vision and machine learning in their products and make their machines competitive in the global market place. The project will create a multi-vendor real-time vision stack for industrial machines that enables multiple types of machines to be developed using a uniform software interface. Combined with an app store model, such interfaces will enable a developer community to create application-specific solutions with ease, add features to machines via software and essentially create a new market. When deployed by equipment manufacturers, it will have societal impact by reducing the number of forklift and other industrial and construction machine related accidents, deaths and property damage. There are secondary benefits such as reducing the amount spent on worker compensation. The scientific impact will be the enhanced understanding of principled approaches to stereoscopic depth estimation combined with machine learning based object detectors to create integrated vision systems that function in real-time on commodity hardware. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the fact that current solutions for autonomous vehicles and machines use expensive LIDARs and RADARs in conjunction with cameras. Such systems are cost-prohibitive and ill-suited for industrial applications that operate in structured warehouse and manufacturing environments rather than highways. Manufacturers can benefit from a cheaper integrated vision-based system where all the necessary algorithms, software and hardware engineering has already been done for them. The intellectual merit of the project lies in achieving the following research goals. 1) Develop an algorithmic approach to stereoscopic depth estimation that combines quick-to-generate classic features (e.g., edges and corners) with machine learning. 2) Combine machine learning based object detectors with stereoscopic depth to create an integrated vision pipeline that functions in real-time on commodity hardware. 3) Devise methods to train the system more easily by relying on depth and motion features. 4) Address critical operational design considerations such as thermal and power management and understand requirements to maintain mechanical and structural integrity through periods of intense use.

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase I project introduces a new design for antibody-based therapeutic molecules. The generally rigid arms in Y-shaped conventional antibodies are replaced with flexible and extendible linkers attached to binding domains that are smaller than those found in conventional antibodies. This new design allows multiple therapeutic targets to be bound at once, with greater binding strength and fewer off-target effects than was previously possible. This project will remake two of the most successful cancer drugs of the last decade, creating improved versions of each. In addition, a new molecule combining the functionality of both will be produced. If this project is successful, it may improve the treatments available for many kinds of advanced metastatic cancer, especially melanoma and lung cancer. Though the current focus is on cancer, the method described here may improve or combine the performance of many therapeutic antibodies; this project is just the first demonstration. The potential long-term impact of this SBIR Phase I project may extend throughout the pharmaceutical industry, representing a significant commercial opportunity and a milestone of applied biological research. This project introduces a novel drug design that improves on monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). It uses a chemical assembly method that joins immunoglobulin Fc domains to small, single-chain fibronectin binding domains through flexible, extendible, non-peptidyl linkers. The resulting flexible drug molecules benefit from two-handed cooperative binding, in which both domains are able to bind a disease target or targets simultaneously. They thus achieve higher binding affinity and target selectivity than mAbs, while also being smaller and easier to manufacture. These molecules can also be mono- or bispecific as needed. This project will produce flexible monospecific and bispecific molecules against the targets of the two most successful checkpoint inhibitors in current cancer immunotherapy. This project encompasses chemical synthesis, verification of binding stoichiometry, in vitro measurements of binding affinity to both purified protein and target cells, and cellular assays of both checkpoint inhibition and bispecific binding. It sets the stage for pre-clinical animal studies of these cancer drugs, and showcases a molecular design that could be used to improve most antibody therapies in the broader pharmaceutical market.

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to dramatically reduce the incidence of natural gas pipeline failures across the country, within the next 3 to 5 years. Every year there are a few hundred &quot;significant&quot; pipeline accidents (fatalities or significant property damage) causing massive damage to life and property, dispersing hazardous materials and disrupting gas distribution services. These events result in many hundreds of millions of dollars in repair and recovery, and large fines that can be up to a billion dollars or more. This scalable and economical capability will significantly reduce the likelihood of such failures, without requiring additional infrastructure. Performance has been validated at a large utility company, and the prototype has demonstrated the ability to capture a substantial fraction of previously undetected events with significant advance warning (90 minutes or more). This outcome represents a clear performance improvement over existing systems and is enabled by advanced models customized for the gas-utility domain. The methods developed in this project can be directly applied to improve detection accuracy in other contexts such as power-grid networks, computer cluster management and financial fraud detection. This SBIR Phase I project proposes to detect anomalies in large-scale gas-utility networks through statistical inference from continuously observed time-series data on pressure, prevailing temperature, and other characteristics of the network. Anomalies within gas-utility networks occur due to a variety of reasons, e.g., sulphur or ice buildup in the pipelines, and corrosion\/aging of hardware, and are often preceded by detectable signatures in the time-series of gas-pressure data. A premise of the project is that the early detection of such signatures, leading to advance warning of 90 minutes or more, allows corrective action within the utility network to avoid significant property damage, loss of life, and service disruption. The project proposes new methods for the rapid estimation of short and medium timescale models of gas pressure behavior from voluminous streaming data, along with methods for constructing prediction bands through Monte Carlo and stochastic optimization techniques. Such methods are non-generic and their success relies crucially on exploiting specific structural properties that are unique to network-level gas-pressure time series, along with modern trends in statistical machine learning. The proposed stochastic optimization techniques will probabilistically classify identified anomalies into ``failure type,&quot; allowing the prioritizing of network level emergency operations.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate the commercial feasibility of a manufacturing platform for functionalizing textile materials with smart functionality such as for wearable smart garments developed out of the NSF funded ASSIST Engineering Research Center for Self-powered Wearable Nanosystems. Smart garments have been touted as the next sensing platform for acquiring biometrics such as electrocardiogram, heart rate, or heart rate variability. However, mass adoption has been difficult due to the high production cost, leading to a small market segment within the greater wearable technology market. As demonstrated by our customer discovery through the NSF I-Corps program in Fall 2016, the biggest barrier to adoption is the production cost. This project seeks to decrease the cost by 5x and decrease production time by 36x, enabling this market segment to grow for applications in health &amp; wellness, healthcare, and beyond. By employing high-throughput direct-write printing and deposition of functional dielectric and conductive materials from the printed electronics space, high-value data generating devices such as smart garments can be manufactured in a single step bridging established practices within the textile and electronics industry resulting in automated textile electronics. Novel materials will be explored to impart functionalities on existing textiles with our manufacturing platform. The broader impact of this project is to create a single manufacturing platform that marginalizes the cost of production for textile electronics such as smart garments and demonstrate minimum viable product (MVP) solutions for stakeholders within the value chain of smart textiles. The proposed innovation combines developments from 3D printing, printed electronics, and textile science to create disruptive advancements in the emerging field of smart textiles and textile electronics, creating new knowledge and commercial innovations. Lastly, manufacturing within the USA has seen a resurgence due to value-added technical textiles manufacturing being brought back. An ancillary broader impact of this project is to serve as a driver for value-added smart garment manufacturing technologies to be employed for USA manufacturing. Success of this project&apos;s vision will allow for low-cost smart textiles to usher in a paradigm shift for the textiles industry, allowing for a multitude of use-cases and innovative business models to proliferate, ultimately increasing the well-being of billions of people around the world.

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase I project addresses the pressing need for providing incarcerated youth and adults with continual systematic and secure personal education and training opportunities, giving inmates the skills they need to productively re-enter society. It will also reduce recidivism rates, and increase their confidence and the potential for contributing to local communities. Every year, more than 700,000 state and federal prisoners are released back into their communities, often with no greater skills than when they went in. The majority of prisoners lack basic high school degrees. The goal of the project is to provide the most effective, secure and flexible offline e-Learning applications for acquiring high school equivalency, the area of greatest need, within the constraints of the prison environment; covering both instructor-led and self-directed learning sessions. At the completion of Phase I, correctional facilities will have an opportunity to utilize a secure, easy-to-administer, offline e-Learning solution for the General Education Development (GED) or for any other education and training in a digital format. A wealth of high-quality instructional programs will be incorporated into the platform that will ultimately lead to a high school equivalency diploma, and additional support to address technical and vocational skills. The Phase I project innovation is centered around the delivery of a single, highly-flexible, secure learning management platform, where multiple applications can be stored on a single server. It will provide the General Education Development (GED) content and will be expandable to incorporate additional e-Learning applications including those that can address recidivism. The adaptable learning management platform will automate the provisioning and installation of these GED and non-GED educational applications on private servers, either on-site at the correctional facility or on off-site private server networks. Different sets of content would be automatically customized for each prison, with no outside Internet connectivity required. Another key innovation will be the ability to have the e-Learning system follow the inmate as they are moved. They will always have access to their specific content and progress status as their data will be centrally-hosted on the fully secured prison servers. Their individual records can be confirmed and reviewed for parole evaluations. By providing uniform student analytics and continuous monitoring of learning outcomes with different content and educational application vendors, the system will advance the capability of offline learning to be a data-driven endeavor and will deliver a personalized experience comparable to systems in civilian life.

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to enhance precision medicine by reducing data processing time and cost, leading to faster results, higher genomic data processing throughput and, ultimately leading to better treatment of patients. Many diseases have their impacts locked in DNA data. Unlocking the data for an individual may provide a significant boost to human healthcare. By providing Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) data analysis in one hour, as compared to the current standard of several days, and at a fraction of today&apos;s cost, DNA tests can become mainstream and research can be accelerated. WGS data is becoming a key component in ensuring correct and timely treatment of vulnerable populations, including newborn babies, people with cancer and rare diseases, and pregnant women. Correct prediction and treatment based on WGS data will extend human lives and promote better quality of life by accelerating the development and broad implementation of precision medicine. The intellectual merit of the proposed activity is to develop a cloud-based framework to accelerate whole genome sequencing data analysis. This SBIR Phase II project creates a software framework where multiple industry-standard genomic analyses will be accelerated transparently to run orders of magnitude faster, while reducing computational costs by up to 4x. The proposed innovation solves the scaling, performance, and cost challenges of WGS computing through novel parallelism extraction and mapping techniques. The framework under development for accelerating genomic analysis has been implemented to focus on GPUs and traditional processors (CPUs). Using this framework, secondary data analysis programs can use all the computing resources present in a standard computing node (CPU cores; GPUs), leading to higher utilization of the system and higher throughput. The GPU accelerates the data parallel portion of the software, while the CPU is mainly responsible for the orchestration of data between CPUs and GPUs, load balancing across multiple accelerators. By providing this framework to run on the cloud and on-premise, users can scale to meet the exploding demands of the DNA analysis industry. The software generates exact results to industry standard tools and does not sacrifice configurability that is critical for users. This framework also will enable researchers and medical professionals to analyze several thousands of genomes simultaneously, leading to higher quality results. This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project relates to the notion of distributed manufacturing using 3D printing, where structural parts may be manufactured onsite, meeting on-demand needs while eliminating transportation costs and inventory storage. Unique, one-off prints, such as may often occur in the medical industry are another virtue of 3D print technology. For these reasons, virtually every major US manufacturing industry is exploring avenues to utilize 3D printing. While 3D printing is unquestionably entering the mainstream of manufacturing technology, a glaring gap in advancing the industry is the simulation of the performance of an &quot;as manufactured&quot; part. A common question surrounding 3D print manufacturing today is: &quot;How do I know if my part will perform as envisioned?&quot; The proposed technology brings an industry leading software simulation to the product engineer and designer to answer this very question, enabling engineers to predict part performance, prior to attempting a build. The speed and simplicity of the software solution is transformative, accelerating the adoption of this disruptive manufacturing technology. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the technical challenge of predicting structural performance of an &quot;as manufactured&quot; fiber-reinforced 3D printed part. Additive Manufacturing (AM) offers the product engineer or designer tremendous freedom to create parts not achievable by more traditional processes. However, parts produced by AM are fundamentally different than those produced by conventional methods. For example, a machined aluminum part is largely homogenous, while a 3D printed part allows for internal lattice (infill) structures. A 3D printed part can also exhibit a multitude of process anomalies such as voids, delamination between layers, warping produced by residual stresses as the part cools, and, in the case of fiber filled plastics, fiber orientation that varies throughout the part. Collectively, these features can have a dramatic impact on the ultimate performance of the part and must be understood by the engineer early in the design stage. This project seeks to develop a commercial software simulation product that predicts the structural performance of a part produced by 3D printing, while optimizing the infill (lattice) structure for strength and weight. Speed, simplicity, and high-fidelity results are hallmarks of the proposed solution and are at the core of the value proposition. This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be a user-friendly and scalable infection control surveillance software platform using advanced biotech and data analytics for monitoring hospital-acquired infection. There is a significant clinical problem in hospitals, where 1 in 25 people who check in will develop a hospital acquired infection. Currently, hospital infection control practitioners (ICPs) have few analytical tools to identify the source of these infections, which can be deadly and cost the health care industry an estimate of $45 billion year. The innovation under development harnesses advanced epidemiological approaches in an easy-to-use application that will enable ICPs to use bacterial genetics as a means to monitor infectious spread within their system so that their sources can be eliminated. The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase II proposal is to develop an infection control surveillance software system using whole-genome sequencing of pathogens and advanced data analytics. The innovation addresses the critical lack of accessible genetic analysis applications designed for local infection control surveillance. Hospitals are observing ever increasing rates of antibiotic resistant infections. These are expensive, endanger patients, and are becoming harder to trace as medical care becomes more complex and spread over multiple facilities. Unfortunately, ICPs have few new tools, other than best hygiene practices, to reduce their mounting infection rates. Decades of research has revealed that epidemiological surveillance using genetic analysis provides a robust level of pathogen traceability; however, this knowledge has not been transferred into hospitals where it is critically needed, due to a lack of technical infrastructure and analytical accessibility. In this Phase II project, the goal is to complete the development of a software application that will enable ICPs to easily and accurately process bacterial genetic data in their own offices and generate rich, meaningful and easy to interpret reports concerning bacterial spread in their networks. ICPs will be warned when infection sources relate to each other, suggesting that a deeper investigation is needed. The result is that infection sources, which are currently missed, will be proactively identified and targeted.

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be substantial: a successful project would transform the construction industry, making it far more efficient by reducing legal conflicts, schedule slips and poor decision making. The proposed work will enable the fast and easy creation of 100% complete visual documentation of a physical space; this documentation can be generated many times throughout the course of construction. In so doing, the proposed project will allow professionals in the construction industry to track progress and communicate with their teams far more efficiently than ever before. A second outcome of the project will be the creation of vast, detailed, never before seen datasets of construction projects and real estate, allowing technical innovations in artificial intelligence and computer vision to impact one of the largest industries in the nation and the world. For example, systems could be trained to automatically spot safety concerns, augmenting the efforts of safety managers and keeping workers safer than ever before. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a fast, easy to use and cheap method to create photorealistic immersive models using off the shelf consumer hardware. Technical hurdles include validating the quality and efficacy of models generated with consumer hardware and automatic creation of routes through the 3D space without human annotation. Technical milestones involve using various sensor streams as well as other prior data to build these routes. With these hurdles cleared, advanced work may include automated analytics between and among 3D models of the same site captured over time. Because of the system&apos;s ease of use, it will enable the collection of large, totally novel datasets. The goal of the research is to produce a prototype that a layperson can use to create an immersive model of a physical site in order to document it with no annotation effort. The plan to reach these goals includes iterative software development against the hurdles listed above, as well as continuous user feedback to guide and refine development.

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase II project will expand on Phase I R&amp;D work to build, test, and optimize a web-based software system for the classroom setting to complement the digital library app for home use developed in Phase I. This cost-effective system will further promote adult-mediated dialogic reading routines with children 0-7 years in age. Early exposure to dialogic reading has been shown to foster virtually all school and reading-readiness indicators - from cognitive and social-emotional development to vocabulary attainment and concepts about print. The new system also introduces foundational science knowledge and habits, such as the capacity to observe, experiment, and problem solve. The ever-widening education attainment and opportunity gaps between rich and poor result in diminished human potential and citizens unequipped for the demands of an information-based labor market. Investments in early childhood can prevent educational deficits, so a cost-effective system that coaches adults to engage children in a dialogic reading process can make a substantial contribution to ending school-readiness gaps - the precursor to persistent achievement gaps - and the cycle of economic and societal disadvantages they perpetuate. This project also addresses the urgent need to bolster the teaching of higher-order thinking skills by early education teachers. The market for early-education digital products is sizable and growing. Purchasers in this market are K-3 schools, preschools, Head Start, social- service agencies, and libraries, as well as individual families. This project will build the technical capacity to augment and measure the growth of adult-led dialogic reading with children 0-7 years in age. The systems architecture and proprietary algorithms will produce a system that increases adult capacity for dialogic questioning and exploration by using the copyrighted, text-specific guidance embedded in the library. Metrics, children&apos;s work product, and online adult-learning modules aim to incentivize and build teacher\/caregiver confidence, inform school leaders, and focus them on continued application of the dialogic process to other books and subjects. Augmentations to the content management system developed in Phase I will enable the sales, distribution, management, and evaluation of all product form factors. The secure data-sharing portal and dashboard built through this project will allow institutional clients to monitor and evaluate their programs. R&amp;D will include collection of engagement metrics, including usage data (access to which is built into the digital library) and online surveys. The core innovation to be studied is whether this product enables adults of varying educational backgrounds to practice an intellectually ambitious reading and thinking method with their children.

The need for high-performance batteries is accelerating, and as batteries grow in energy density, size, and production volumes, so will the issues that persist with quality. Unless these issues are addressed, they will continue to have major implications for the performance, safety, and adoption of these important technologies. The challenge is that outside of R&amp;D labs, the industry relies on essentially the same basic data as when batteries were first invented: voltage, current, and temperature. As a result, at commercial scales, only a small percentage of batteries are inspected in a meaningful way, with methods that only provide indirect information about physical condition. This Phase 2 project is focused on developing a new platform for production-level battery inspection that directly probes the physical condition of batteries with a high testing throughput. This could lead to better decisions in manufacturing environments and could decrease system costs, increase capacity and operational lifetime, and accelerate the scale-up of promising new materials. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project addresses the need for a physical mode of inspection in battery production environments that is capable of screening every cell with high fidelity. Currently, inspection in production-level environments are limited to electrical measurements and X-rays. Electrical methods provide only indirect and cell-averaged information about physical condition, and X-rays are not practically able to detect the distribution of electrolyte within batteries nor the formation of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer (both of which strongly affect long-term reliability, performance, and safety of batteries). This Phase 2 project aims to develop a platform that utilizes sound-based methods to inspect batteries in production-environments. This will involve developing a scaled, automated hardware system as well as software and computational methods for processing and analyzing the acoustic signals. The Phase 2 project will also include various testing and validation efforts to assess the ability of acoustic analysis to both directly determine the performance quality and reliability of cells beyond beginning of life capacity and resistance, as well as to improve the performance of strings of cells and modules. This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will continue development of cutting-edge nanopore technology that will greatly enhance biological preservation of regenerative medicines such as stem cells, complex tissues, and organs. Such a technology has the potential to greatly improve the biobanking and transport infrastructure of healthcare for on-demand cells and tissues, improved mass trauma care and advanced personalized medical procedures. Biopreservation is required in regenerative medicine at nearly all levels in the acquisition of source material, isolation, storage and shipment of a final product to patient. Yet critically, the field lacks the ability to safely and efficiently preserve these tissues and medicines while maintaining high cell viability and function after cryopreservation, severely limiting product shelf life. Nowhere is the absence of a biobanking technology more palpable than organ transplantation, where the time window between donor and recipient (4-7 hours) is not enough to properly match donations, screen for pathogens, or transport long distances. Enabling the United States to safely bank organs at subzero temperature will significantly enhance national healthcare. The US faces strong commercial and competitiveness reasons to invest in all facets of regenerative medicine, including organ therapies. Cryopreservation solutions would indirectly enable significant savings to the healthcare system, the patient, and healthcare insurance companies with the cost savings from regenerative medicine treatments estimated to be nearly $250 billion per year in the U.S. The cytotoxicity of current biopreservation techniques is largely associated with inefficient cryoprotective agent and water delivery across the cell membrane during cooling leading to irreparable cell damage from ice formation. Phase I established a fundamentally different approach to cryoprotective agent (CPA) optimization by developing first-in-the-field bioinspired nanopores as transmembrane mega highways to facilitate safe and efficient intracellular delivery and removal of cryoprotective agents during cryopreservation and dramatically increase post-thaw cell yield, viability, and function. The pore-formers assist CPA loading at reduced temperatures to make up the functional loss of biological protein channels at cold temperatures, reduce the amount of CPA required to remarkably low concentrations, and expand the selectable range of CPAs, all while dynamically dissociating at physiological temperature to prevent open-pore toxicity. Further R&amp;D effort will diversify molecular design, optimize lead molecules, scale-up production, and perform cryopreservation studies on regenerative medicines of major therapeutic significance such as stem cells and complex tissues.

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase II project aims to transform the lives and future economic opportunities of young people and their communities through democratized access to cross-curricular computer science, engineering, and cybersecurity education. Daily life, economies, innovation, and national security all depend on having a strong and skilled STEM workforce. For this workforce to exist, our schools must provide the necessary education and experience to prepare students for such careers. Unfortunately, a vast majority of K-12 educators today are not equipped with the resources to do so successfully. The importance of solving this problem cannot be overstated; developing a plentitude of competent STEM professionals is critical to ensure economic and security stability. These project goals are aligned with NSF?s mission to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; and to secure the national defense. The resulting technology innovation is of potential service to more than 50 million primary and secondary school students and 3.5 million educators nationally, with an ability to impact their course of study, improve STEM outcomes, increase hands-on project-based experience, and improve future economic opportunities. This technology innovation emerges at the intersection of cloud-based software technology, real-time collaboration tools, and learning management systems. This reimagined technology tool easily connects, attracts, and fosters delivery of cross-curricular, educational computing literacy resources aligned with national and state educational standards. The project aims to empower and support educators and students in tackling the many new opportunities and growing number of resources in computer science (CS) and engineering education at home, in classrooms, and in community centers. As the CS education landscape evolves with new and exciting technical curriculum, this innovation analyzes the willingness of educators to create or adopt new computer science education, the effectiveness of real-time collaboration tools on CS education outcomes, and measures student awareness and feelings about computer science and engineering disciplines. This technology innovation promotes customer participation and a unique ability to provide support at the ground level in real-time. There are solutions that provide massive online CS courses and curricula; however, none targeting K-12 classrooms or educators which support and integrate cross-curricular computer science, engineering, and cybersecurity education. Offering cloud-based, synchronous technology tools this technology enables real-time, expert mentoring and pair-programming in a K12 virtual learning environment on a massive scale.

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is multilayered. First, there is the potential for creation of a carbon nanotubes manufacturing industry in the United States that will create hundreds of high-paying domestic manufacturing jobs advance U.S. leadership and knowledge in industrial electrochemistry. Secondly, Saratoga Energy&apos;s technology has the potential to benefit the United States economy by increasing the cost-competitiveness and performance of lithium-ion batteries, paving the way to the broader adoption of electric vehicles and grid\/renewable energy storage. In turn, this will help reduce the strategic importance of oil, the cost of securing global oil supplies, as well as greenhouse gas emission. While lithium-ion batteries are the focus of this body of work, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are also used in a variety of other applications - advanced composite materials, nanotechnology, catalyst supports, water filtration, and other areas of commercial impact. This SBIR Phase II project proposes to 1) electrochemically characterize carbon nanotubes as a cathode conductive additive for high-performance lithium-ion battery applications and 2) construct a small pilot-scale carbon nanotube manufacturing unit capable of producing 1 kg of product per day for retail distribution. Saratoga Energy Research Partners, LLC (Saratoga Energy), has developed a high-selectivity electrochemical process to convert carbon dioxide into carbon nanotubes. In the work conducted thus far, Saratoga Energy has established that its carbon nanotubes can be manufactured at a cost ~50X cheaper than the market price for state-of-the-art battery-grade carbon nanotubes. Battery manufacturers use carbon nanotubes to enable the reduction of conductive additive content in the cathode, thus improving specific and volumetric energy density. Carbon nanotubes also act as a reinforcing agent in the electrodes improving their mechanical properties. This is important for the battery assembly process but also for battery life performance, as the carbon nanotube network maintains a high level of cohesion of the electrodes upon repeated charge-discharge cycles. However, today, the high price of commercial carbon nanotubes limits their use, which will be addressed by our lower cost CNTs. This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be an instrument that alleviates several current difficulties in the growth measurement of many microbes, especially anaerobic and other fastidious organisms. A large number of these species are naturally occurring in the human body, and have recently been shown to play critical roles in allergies, autoimmune diseases, dietary health, cancer, infection response, and more. The study of these species is considered by many to be the next frontier of modern medicine, especially as current approaches to managing infectious diseases, such as traditional antibiotics, appear to be losing effectiveness. However, current measurement technology is largely incompatible with the specialized environments and chambers in which anaerobic organisms must be grown. There is a large unmet need for better ways to measure anaerobic bacterial growth; this need is growing quickly as interest in the field increases. The ability to conduct high-throughput experiments in specialized environments will become critical as research into various human microbiomes accelerates, and demand for high-volume data grows. The existing market for high-throughput measurement devices is at least $300 million and growing. This platform will allow for systematic studies of cell culture growth that can be accomplished easily and economically. This SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop and refine a miniaturized multi-well plate reader that measures optical characteristics of up to 96 cell samples for measuring growth of many microbial samples simultaneously. The continuing rise of systems and computational biology demonstrates a growing demand for large amounts of quantitative data, and the variety of microbes relevant to the human body necessitates such an approach. However, these measurement techniques are not universally accessible due to current instruments&apos; complexity, size, and cost. This project will continue development of a miniature, simplified version of a device called a multi-well plate reader, expanding the availability of parallel growth measurement (and other metrics) to a wider array of researchers and environments. The first goal is to simplify the instrument&apos;s electronics, add an on-board display for clarity, and allow battery-powered operation. The next goal is to accelerate equilibration to any surrounding environment to allow proper functioning even in extreme conditions, by measuring a wide array of environmental variables at different points in space and time. The third goal is to solidify the device&apos;s mechanical aspects for reliability and stability in a shaker. Finally, this project will support the development of a fully-functional wireless interface for control and data management, allowing effective remote use in any environment.

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase II project aims to develop and commercialize a transparent, thin multifunctional coating for corrosion and biofouling prevention on coated surface. Its environmentally friendly product will be an efficient ready-to-use single component product that can be applied with ease, and would dry in ambient conditions without the need for external heating equipment. The global annual expenditure to mitigate corrosion is in the range of $2.5 trillion, roughly equal to 3.4% of the world&apos;s GDP. Protecting assets from corrosion is, hence, a critical requirement for all the industries. A broad range of applications can benefit from this coating technology such as aviation industry where removal of toxic chromium compounds from coating procedures is of high priority, automobile manufacturing where extended corrosion protection to vehicles without using toxic treatments is constantly sought, structural engineering where providing long life protection to bridges is always needed, marine engineering where protecting ships from corrosion and not contributing to ecological imbalance is long sought, military where minimizing the maintenance downtime of tanks and guns is of prime importance, hospitals that are interested in longer lasting medical implants, and paints and coating industry that is desiring removal of volatile organic components from their paints and coatings. The proposed coating is expected to offer scratch resistance and oleophobic characteristics in addition to corrosion protection. The initial success of this project will result in two high-volume products. This project aims to develop a specialized single-part, ready-to-use, nominally bioceramic liquid coating for protection against corrosion and fouling activities. On application over desired surface, this transparent liquid transforms into hard-yet-flexible coating. This thin coating composition consists of in-place generated nanoparticles of organometallic compounds in the 3D network of polysilsesquioxane. The reactivity of the precursor to coating is designed such that material can react with substrates in ambient conditions and dries to solid film without the need of any external heating. The hardened coating adheres to most surfaces including metals, ceramics, plastics, glasses, and wood. The optimum thickness of coating is approximately ten microns and can impart various desired surface functionalities to the coated object. In this project, efforts are directed towards optimization of current composition to be compatible with broad range of commercially available topcoat materials. The optimized coating composition will be subjected to a rapid properties screening before third party testing, validation and approvals. An extensive field testing will be conducted in collaboration with potential customers. This innovative coating technology will initially result into two products that can be used in place of carcinogenic hexavalent chromium compounds that are currently in use for the corrosion protection of metals. While one of the products would act as a corrosion prevention compound that can adhere to commercial topcoat paints, the other would act as self-cleaning coating to prevent biofouling activities.

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to allow for the recycling of valuable materials from complex wastes that today cannot be recovered. The commercial impact from this innovation is to allow for complex waste streams that contain multiple materials, such as textiles, to serve as the source of raw materials for the manufacture of new goods in a way that is cost advantaged. This gives those businesses that use such raw materials a sustainable alternative and importantly, a lower-cost, efficiently produced material. In this way, there will be significant incentive for the reuse of thousands of tons of material that today either goes to landfills, oceans, or is incinerated for energy, a very low value application. A funded, successful project will yield an entirely new framework for recycling of complex, multi-component materials. This SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop novel technologies for fractionating complex wastes. Multi-component wastes such as textiles represent upwards of 4% of total landfill volume. Today, there does not exist technology for recovering the high-value materials that are in these wastes. The proposed project intends to develop a new approach using chemical techniques as opposed to simple melt recycling to enable the value-added recycling of high value polymers from such wastes. Chemical process development will take place in order to take the current status of the technology to implementation in a pilot plant. The main technical objective of the proposal is to develop the process so as to produce large amounts of consistent, high purity product. Materials such as polyester and nylon cannot be separated from natural or cellulosic fibers such as cotton or other textile materials. The goals of the research are to develop the proposers&apos; current process for fractionating the synthetic resins with an emphasis on achieving high purity products at larger volumes. To this end, various chemistry and chemical engineering techniques will be investigated for exclusion of impurities from end product polymer at the kg scale. This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase I project will produce an innovative reading application and administrative portal to support science learning. Although the science textbook is a central curricular resource, this resource is often inaccessible and difficult to read. Science textbooks are syntactically (grammatically) and semantically (word meaning) complex. Specifically, elementary and secondary science texts are often written 3 to 5 years beyond what is developmentally appropriate. Because of these complexities, science textbooks often overwhelm students&apos; working memory, preventing them from constructing accurate mental representations of the target concepts. Thus, this project will develop and test a multiplatform, personalizable e-reader with embedded reading and language support. The intellectual merit of the effort resides in its ability to improve science comprehension through personalized and adaptive content. This project will produce content and assessments targeting the Next Generation Science Standards associated with Earth and Space Science. The customizable features will make fundamental science knowledge more accessible and interesting to students -- and thus the Public. Given these benefits, it has strong potential to support future generations of STEM professionals and a more scientifically literate citizenry. This project will produce a multiplatform reading application to support science learning. The key innovation will be to make science content adaptable and adjustable for learners. This Phase II project has five technical goals: (a) develop and test the e-reader to work via tablet and mobile web; (b) develop and test enhanced reading features; (c) develop and test administrative and payment portals; (d) develop and curate NGSS-aligned content and assessments; (e) conduct user testing with students and teachers. During Phase II, the project team will address some technological challenges in bringing this innovation to market. The key features of the interactive reading application create a potential for unnecessary memory load. This technological challenge will be overcome by architecting the program to be highly preprocessed and modular. A second challenge is providing secure access to multi-tiered users. This technical challenge will be overcome by architecting the program to allow for secure, multiple group membership, ensuring data visibility and security. A diverse SquidBooks team, with expertise in business, software design and engineering, educational research and measurement, science education, writing, and science will achieve these goals of this Phase II project. This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to increase the impact of precision medicine by simultaneously addressing large-scale medical data aggregation and analytics. Patient medical information comes in many forms: DNA sequences, medical images, clinical observations, etc. Integration of these various data sources across large patient populations can reveal novel insights into clinical disease and inform new treatment options. There is a growing need for scalable data integration to support the delivery of precision medicine. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will build on the data Framework that was created during Phase I work. This Framework supports the aggregation of different types of medical data into a single data core ?pool?, and computation on the pooled data in a scalable cloud environment. The Framework includes a custom database for genomic sequencing data. During Phase II of this project, this custom (sparse matrix) approach to data storage will be adapted to handle microscopy images of cancer and other diseased tissues. The Framework, with its integrated genomic and image databases, will be marketed to healthcare systems, biotechnology companies, and pharmaceutical companies interested in applying advanced analytics on large, complex datasets.

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase II project, the Engineering Design Instruction Software for implementing Objectives of Next generation standards (EDISON), will combine Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) concepts together with engineering design, simulation, Augmented Reality (AR), 3-D printing, and real-world experiments. The project will create a collaborative platform for middle school engineering projects where students create, analyze, simulate, and construct designs for several types of projects like bridges, cars, circuits, simple machines, drones, and robots. This project will provide positive experiences with STEM and engineering in middle school, when many students lose interest in these economically vital fields. EDISON will foster STEM engagement and inquiry in middle school, by leveraging gaming, team collaboration, 3D printing, and augmented reality. The project will create engineering experiences that connect math and science content directly to real world applications to improve student academic performance in traditional science and math subjects. This work has the potential to promote effective integration of engineering in K-12, prepare students for future careers, expand scientific literacy, and engage diverse groups of students in STEM, supporting NSF&apos;s mission. This SBIR Phase II project will produce a collaborative engineering design platform for middle school, containing realistic design tools, content creation, embedded standards-based STEM assessment, and tools supporting prototyping and testing. EDISON provides end to end solutions for team-based engineering in middle schools and maintains engagement through gamification. This project will develop sophisticated tools that are lacking in existing engineering curricula, and support math and science standards alignment using model-based engineering, virtual design collaboration, and embedded tools for student evaluation. In this work the Phase I prototype will be extended by developing reusable design modules for circuit design, simple machines, aerodynamics, and programming. Testing tools using sensors and Augmented Reality will be added for real world data collection and analysis. Numerous modular standards aligned lessons and a content creation interface to facilitate EDISON?s transition to an instructional platform will be created. Finally, in collaboration with our University partner EDISON will be extensively tested and student outcomes evaluated in 6th, 7th, and 8th grade classrooms using a combination of embedded, quantitative, and qualitative methods. The goal is to better meet the STEM instructional needs of educators and students with superior capabilities, engaging experiences, and easy to use tools.

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is provided by a novel data processing architecture, utilizing high-parallel in-memory computing for certain recurring and data intensive functions. Traditional computer architecture funnels all data through the central processing unit (CPU). Multiple CPU cores and very high clock frequencies are used to address the issue of ever increasing demands on data processing capability. However, the transportation capacity of data between memory and CPU cores has become a limiting factor creating a &apos;memory bottleneck&apos;. This limitation is most noticeable in the recent and rapid development of artificial intelligence applications which deploy so called neuromorphic computing techniques, which in turn require a very high parallelism in computation and proportional demands on memory bandwidth. This project performs key repetitive operations within the memory itself, leveraging the inherent parallelism of the memory architecture, thereby avoiding a large percentage of the data transport otherwise required. The resulting elimination of the memory bottleneck provides a path forward for high complexity neuromorphic computing applications such as autonomous navigation used for self-driving cars. Reduced demands on data transport and CPU also significantly reduce power consumption, enabling a wide variety of mobile artificial intelligence applications. The proposed project investigates the system level integration challenges of a memory-centric neuromorphic computing approach, and aims to demonstrate a seamless integration with existing software platforms currently using traditional neuromorphic computing processors. It is important for a novel hardware platform to be compatible with existing software in order to lower barriers to market entry. This Phase II project also develops the actual semiconductor product which has been investigated in Phase I as a feasibility demonstrator. The Phase II product is based on a non-volatile high density memory architecture, and as such is expected to provide the full capability in terms of both power and operations per second. Once the hardware is available in the second half of the project, these key parameters will be thoroughly characterized and benchmarked against the current state of the art technology. A projection will be made outlining the future scaling potential using ultra high density volatile and non-volatile memory geared towards high complexity neuromorphic computing beyond what is currently possible using existing approaches.

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase II project will develop a drug delivery technology to address the unmet need of antiproliferative drug delivery below-the-knee. In the United States, there are 323,000 new critical limb ischemia (CLI) patients each year. CLI is the most severe stage of peripheral artery disease (PAD), atherosclerosis of the lower limbs. Ultimately, 40% of CLI patients will undergo lower limb amputation as a result of CLI, half of whom will then die within a year. Existing technologies have failed in these vessels, resulting in higher rates of patient amputation. This project will create a better intravascular drug delivery tool to treat PAD patients after angioplasty. This improved drug delivery will provide three key societal benefits: 1) reduced costs and greater efficiency when revascularizing the vessels of critical limb ischemia patients, 2) a reduction in healthcare costs by reducing repeat procedures, and 3) improved patient outcomes resulting from improved drug delivery achieved using image guidance. If successful, this technology may improve patient health while reducing treatment costs for millions of patients around the world. This will also improve understanding of what aspects of CLI treatment are most effective by offering the flexibility to vary different aspects of drug delivery. When completed, this project will enhance the understanding of intravascular drug delivery with ultrasound and microbubbles. This project will provide strong technical innovation through a new ultrasound drug delivery device and new methods to evaluate cardiovascular drug delivery devices. Using a combination of intravascular ultrasound and drug loaded microbubbles, this project will provide better localization of delivery with lower drug doses. This project will then evaluate the drug delivery platform using realistic models of human disease from donated tissue combined with routine techniques (histopathology) and more recent advances (microCT) to evaluate the effect of the disease on drug delivery. The core research objective of this project is to deliver paclitaxel to human diseased arteries with the new intravascular ultrasound and microbubble drug delivery platform. It is anticipated that this project will result in an improved drug uptake over the existing technologies in diseased arteries where drug uptake is poorest. The data and techniques from this project will be used to compel adoption among interventionalists and to validate the the drug delivery system as a tool to prevent amputations in CLI patients.

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to engineer loblolly pine to increase wood density (yield) by 20% with no additional land, water, or fertilizer use requirements. With global demand for wood products expected to rise 60% by 2060, managed pine plantations will play a key role in helping to meet this need. By identifying and studying the genes that control plant development, particularly as they relate to cellulose (wood) production in the cell wall, the tree&apos;s natural ability to capture and utilize carbon dioxide (CO2) for more wood growth has been enhanced through genetic engineering. This technology will strengthen the United States&apos; position as the leading producer and exporter of commercial wood products, i.e., pulpwood for paper, sawtimber for lumber, and wood pellets for fuel. Additionally, with advancements in the understanding of the pine genome, the work proposed here will stimulate the development of novel innovations in the field of forest genetics while the proposed genetically engineered seedlings help to address growing industry needs for commercial wood products. This SBIR Phase II project will develop a more efficient approach to engineering high wood density loblolly pine varieties. In contrast to traditional breeding, which has seen a modest 6% increase in wood density improvements over the past 20 years, this work proposes to increase wood density in pine by 20% through application of a directed, &quot;gene trait&quot; method to genetically engineer loblolly pine by altering secondary cell wall gene regulation. The proposed research will utilize a newly improved pine transformation protocol to scale up prototype production of tree seedlings designed with patent-pending, cell wall gene platform technologies. Also, this work establishes a pine engineering pipeline using germplasm adapted to different selective environments. This will streamline the production process while allowing for faster testing and development of technologies that improve growth traits in multiple growing regions. Specifically, plants engineered with this method will be tested for their long-term wood quality characteristics in both greenhouse and field trials. The goal of this project is to establish a commercial scale production program for loblolly pine engineered seedlings, and prepare for field testing and ultimately commercial sales of the cell wall platform technologies that have been developed.

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase II project focuses on creating scalable Virtual Learning Assistant technology for automatic educational assessments using open response questions. Educational researchers and experts believe that the best pedagogies responsible for improving students&apos; learning outcomes involve (i) open response questions assessments and (ii) one-to-one instructional tutoring. Students learn better when they are given an opportunity to construct answers in their own words instead of selecting from multiple choices and when they receive immediate guidance and coaching. However, these two pedagogies are very time consuming and expensive to implement, making them very difficult to scale. The proposed project will apply the most advanced technologies such as Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing to solve both these problems. Students will benefit from the interactive formative assessment that engages them in a natural language conversation. This innovation is applicable across the grade levels in K-12, higher education, and adult learning and across the subject areas including the sciences. It will facilitate implementation of more rigorous academic standards and make online education more effective. This innovation will improve students&apos; learning outcomes, save teachers&apos; time and reduce the cost of delivering high quality engaging education at a large scale. This project will create a new type of virtual assistant technology that is exclusively focused on education. The proposed Virtual Learning Assistant (VLA) will advance the conversational AI technology to create pedagogically rich learning and assessment environments for any topic in a content area. The VLA is uniquely distinct from general purpose virtual assistants in its ability to evaluate an open response answer instead of merely serving information. This project will investigate and create various algorithms for processing natural language input arising in an educational setting across different subjects or topics. The resulting mobile and web based product will allow teachers to create new high-quality assessment items with minimal input and assign them to their students. When a student answers a question, the VLA will analyze it instantly for linguistic syntax and semantics using statistical and deterministic knowledge representations. The VLA will generate not only a numerical score reflecting the accuracy of the answer, but also a qualitative feedback that will guide the student towards conceptual mastery of the topic. As part of this Phase II research, a pilot study will be conducted each year involving teachers and students to study the efficacy of the VLA and its scalability. This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this project is to enable mobile robots to coexist harmoniously with people in their homes and offices. The market for consumer and office robots is projected to grow 17% annually, seven times faster than the market for manufacturing robots, reaching $1.5B by 2019. An important step toward market growth is creating autonomous robots that are unobtrusive, intelligent, and highly agile. Accomplishing this requires robots to be small enough to stay out of the way and fast enough to elegantly avoid humans and environmental obstacles. Inappropriate noise levels and safety concerns make it unlikely that airborne vehicles will be prevalent in indoor environments, whereas wheeled mobile robots can achieve near-silent operation. Tiny, fast robots are unobtrusive enough to use as a low-cost surveillance tool in home or office security, and portable enough for covertly investigating hostile situations. People with severe disabilities could travel vicariously by combining a virtual reality headset with a telepresence robot. Fast maneuvering robots could be used as a compelling educational or entertainment platform for kids and adults. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will integrate the Phase I feasibility work on multi-surface aggressive maneuvering for small robots into a consumer-affordable hardware platform suitable for commercialization. In addition to developing a miniaturized robotic platform, this project will also address challenges outside the scope of Phase I related to home-scale autonomous navigation to locations of interest, which can be fixed (such as a room) or dynamic (such as the location of a pet). Such challenges include multi-room mapping, planning, path execution, and high-speed obstacle avoidance. This project will also develop fail-safe reactive techniques for navigation in situations where a model of the environment is either incorrect or altogether unavailable. Four key Phase II objectives will address these challenges: 1) multi-room surface-aware maneuvering with vision-based localization, 2) efficient maneuvering in the presence of obstacles and clutter, 3) map initialization for monitoring places of interest, and 4) development of the final hardware platform. This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to lay a foundation for vehicle to infrastructure communication focused on applications that add direct value to mobility. Many solutions are focused on getting information to the vehicle, while it is often the infrastructure that requires vehicle information to operate more efficiently. Currently, traffic signals enforce the right-of-way of everyone regardless of in-vehicle technology. This is why optimizing their effects on the road network can provide tremendous benefit. There are significant benefits to transit as well, like buses and light rail that, when given priority at intersections, improves on-time performance which is a major factor in ridership rates. The proposed project advances the work of the joint standardization of the National Transportation Communications for Intelligent Transportation Systems Protocol (NTCIP) to achieve interoperability between various traffic signal controller vendors to enable shared control and organization between different operating agencies. It is not unusual to have sections of roadway be managed by local, county, and state within the same small area. These overlapping jurisdictions produce fractures within the road network resulting in the asynchronous timing of traffic signals. The aim is to consolidate the management into a signal network capable of coordinating large areas of traffic signals to increase mobility&apos;s overall efficiency. With a cloud solution that is capable of speaking to each networked intersection, vehicle telemetry data and route information can be used to proactively optimize signal timing. Working with prioritized vehicles such as buses, fire trucks, and ambulances, pilot studies will be conducted to perform priority and preemption along routes that cross jurisdictions. Each pilot case will be analysed based on key performance indicators set forth by the agencies.

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase II project seeks to develop a novel low-cost molecular filter for use in harsh environments. This is accomplished using commodity silica gel, commonly found as a desiccant in food packing, whose pores can be made to be only a few molecules wide. Accurate tuning of the size and shape of the silica gel pores enables certain molecules to pass through while others are blocked from passing. One promising application for these molecular filters is their use in grid-scale energy storage. Flow batteries could store city-sized quantities of renewable energy. However, they require the use of expensive molecular filters that are not easily replaced due to the harsh battery environments. The low-cost filters developed during this SBIR Phase II project have the potential to reduce the cost of flow batteries by as much as 15%, making them less expensive than grid-scale lithium ion batteries. Lower cost grid-scale storage means that more renewable energy generation (e.g., solar &amp; wind) can be added without overwhelming the grid. Low cost molecular filter also has commercial upside with the potential to capture a significant fraction of the $2.7 billion-dollar market. Because of this, this project could generate nearly 15 jobs and $39 million dollars in tax revenue over the next 5 years. This SBIR Phase II Project is developing a molecularly selective sol-gel ceramic membrane that does not require calcination or high polymer loading but also does not fracture during compression in stack applications (e.g., fuel cells and flow batteries). This is accomplished by decoupling the selective region from the region of the membrane being compressed by the stack. These membranes will be utilized to improve the performance and reduce the costs of all-vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFB). VRFB membranes require selective transport of hydronium ions but not vanadium ions. Size and charge exclusion membranes must therefore have tight control over the pore size, shape and network structure to selectively transport ions. Towards this end, sol-gel processing and surface charge modification will be utilized to maximize proton conductivity and limit vanadium ion permeability. Optimized membrane formulations must also have excellent chemical and mechanical stability; showing no degradation after hundreds of VRFB cycles. Finally, membranes must be scaled from lab size (50 cm2) to commercial size (&gt; 500cm2) while maintaining performance uniformity. The low-cost membranes developed during this SBIR Phase I project have the potential to reduce the cost of VRFBs by as much as 15%. Lower cost grid-scale storage means that more renewable energy generation (e.g., solar &amp; wind) can be added without overwhelming the grid.

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is that the technology provides health care systems with a very accurate view of what their patients experience during health care encounters - what is going well and importantly, what specific problems are frustrating patients. With this insight, providers are able to quickly and efficiently resolve issues. Patients are increasingly active in deciding where they receive care. As health care spending declines, providers find themselves competing for patients. To attract patients and drive market share, health systems must deliver not just excellent clinical care but also positive patient experiences. Patients that have a negative health care encounter often choose to go elsewhere. When they do, providers lose margin. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the industry need for better insight on how to quickly and efficiently improve patient experiences. Surveys which are the norm in health care fail to deliver service failure details. The company&apos;s software goes beyond current text analysis solutions by automating the classification of patient feedback based on the ideas and sentiment expressed by patients. These results are converted into precise analytics and displayed in dashboards so front-line managers can quickly identify problems and make rapid improvements in patient experiences. Previously the company demonstrated the technical feasibility of its software by focusing on a narrow set of providers. This research will refine the software so that it is capable of analyzing patient feedback across a wide range of health care organizations. What operational changes will have the greatest, positive impact on patient loyalty and market share? Results from this project will answer that question for a broad range of health care organizations.

The project will advance machine vision technology for robotic harvesting and will be a key enabling technology leading to acceptance of automated harvesting as safe and effective. The market sector addressed by this project is strawberry farmers, though the technology will be applicable to other types of fruit and vegetable farming as well. The automated harvesting technology advanced by this project will alleviate chronic and worsening labor shortages faced by strawberry farmers and will ensure that strawberries remain affordable and available to consumers. Filling the need created by farming labor shortages is a $1 billion business opportunity. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop new vision processing and inspection methods vital to enabling use of an automated, robotic strawberry harvester. Acceptance of automated harvesting technology by strawberry farmers hinges on the ability of the harvester to remove bad berries from the plant without allowing the undesirable berries from entering the harvester packaging stream and potentially contaminating large quantities of berries. To achieve this, it will be necessary for the harvester to identify and eliminate diseased, rotten, damaged, or infested berries at multiple stages in the stream from automated picking to final packaging. The classification method that identifies the berries to be eliminated will be extremely accurate, with a very high detection rate and a low false alarm rate. The methods developed will be suitable for installation on a farming machine that is subject to a harsh outdoor environment as well as the shock and vibration environment found on a robotic harvesting device. New handling processes will be developed that will allow automated inspection of the entire berry without damaging the fruit or creating a risk of cross contamination from infected berries, significantly advancing the state of the art for automated strawberry processing.

Engineered cellular therapeutics are poised to become the next major driver of pharmaceutical innovation due to their potential for sophisticated behavior and modular design. The gut is an ideal entry point for deploying engineered therapeutic cells, as it serves as our body&apos;s natural interface with foreign genetic material. A key impediment to bacterial drug development for the gut is the lack of strategies for achieving predictable colonization across the wide range of gut environments that patients can harbor. Furthermore, tools for on-demand clearance of therapeutic strains to ensure safety do not currently exist. The proposed innovation will overcome these challenges and allow the potential of engineered bacterial cells as therapies to be fully realized. This SBIR Phase II project will develop the technologies necessary to achieve predictable colonization of, and targeted clearance from, the human gut by engineered bacterial strains. Predictable colonization will be achieved through the use of a therapeutic strain that has been modified to consume a privileged prebiotic substrate that can be dosed alongside the strain to precisely control its abundance by giving it a competitive advantage. To ensure containment and enable targeted clearance, the therapeutic strain will be further modified such that it only can grow in environments where the prebiotic is present. This will allow for the generation of a robust synthetic niche within the gut that can be manipulated solely through the administration of this prebiotic control molecule. In addition, to enable the commercial deployment of these novel technologies, manufacturing protocols will be developed to ensure that a fully integrated therapeutic strain can be produced in sufficient quantities and stably formulated. This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this project is to enable vast deployment of energy storage to increase installation of renewable energy for reduced pollution and greenhouse gases, to improve energy security, and to improve energy efficiency and safety. The project will realize a dramatic reduction in cost and size of Energy Storage Systems (ESS) that will allow penetration of ESS into markets served by fossil fuels. One key market is grid ancillary services which includes Frequency Regulation (FR) that regulates grid frequency and stability. With the potential of this project, the FR market for battery based ESS is expected to grow from $100M\/yr to over $4B\/yr. This project has the societal benefits of replacing fossil fuel based ?peaker? plants that are commonly used to perform FR, with clean Li-ion battery based ESS. Furthermore, by providing lower cost FR capability for the grid, the project will enable grid penetration of more renewable energy, which requires additional FR capability. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a highly compact integrated modular inverter\/energy storage system to revolutionize deployment of energy storage system for grid, micro-grid, energy efficiency, and energy reliability support. The development effort proposed here includes an advanced energy storage system consisting of an extremely compact 150kW high frequency 3-level inverter, an integrated 100kWhr compact Li-ion battery system, proprietary battery management systems and internet communications capability. This will provide a highly integrated and scalable 150kW Energy Storage System with an integrated battery string inverter with 60% reduced system cost and 10X reduced size that will open new markets for energy storage and renewable energy. The project will develop key technology innovations which work together with advanced Li-ion batteries to form a revolutionary new product. These innovations include: high frequency 3-level inverter with innovative high frequency control and output filter to achieve &gt;10X reduction in volume; a novel topology that integrates inverters into each cell string and eliminates many components resulting in 60% system cost reduction; a modular and scalable design that is fault tolerant and allows easy optimization for multiple system uses.

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project involves addressing complexities in fluid management, one of the most important issues in critical care. Suboptimal fluid management results in many complications such as pulmonary edema. Studies show that fluid overload is associated with higher rates of morbidity and mortality. Recent studies also show that restrictive fluid resuscitation protocols result in a reduction of mechanical ventilation days and hospital length of stay. The clinical literature provides ample evidence of optimized fluid therapy benefits for different patient populations including those with sepsis and post-operative patients. However, implementation of fluid therapy is highly subjective. Specifically, the most critical unanswered questions involve the timing and the volume of fluid infusions. This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project proposes to develop a system which uses continuous measurements from a standard intensive care unit hemodynamic monitoring device to provide actionable feedback for clinicians to optimize fluid and vasoactive drug management. In the proposed Phase II work, we will further develop the clinical decision support system developed in Phase I. This includes further development of the underlying technology and also performing preliminary clinical studies.

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase I project addresses the need to reduce the time associated with conducting tests currently used to establish targeted antibiotic (and dose) to treat infections. Sepsis and septic shock are one of the leading contributors to death in US Hospitals, responsible for 250,000 deaths annually (estimated at 30-50% of all hospital deaths). To combat these high death rates, time is of the essence. The administration of targeted (versus broad-spectrum) antibiotic therapy in the first five to six hours of septic shock increases the likelihood of survival by roughly fifty percent. This project combines electronics and microchannel fluidics to rapidly obtain results on antibiotic susceptibility. The project requires engineering, software development, and method development, resulting in an instrument that utilizes disposable cards to conduct the testing. The resulting product will allow transition from broad spectrum to targeted antibiotic therapy faster (1 day - weeks), leading to major benefits: (1) patient outcomes are greatly improved by faster transition to directed antibiotic therapy; (2) Reduced hospitalization stays (reduced intensive care stays), resulting in significant monetary saving for healthcare systems (estimated at a cost savings of at least $3.75B annually). (3) Reduced broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy reduces the current fostering of antibiotic resistance in healthcare settings globally. This project uses Microchannel Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (m-EIS) to measure the &quot;bulk capacitance&quot; (Cb) of a suspension. Cb is a measure of the amount of charge transiently accumulated at the membranes of living cells in a suspension. Cell proliferation results in an increase in Cb, whereas cell death results in a decrease. Using m-EIS to measure bacteria in the presence of candidate antibiotics and doses, is robust, sensitive, and extremely fast, determining, in real time, cell growth, stasis, or death (in approximately 4 hrs). This project will develop a rapid, direct-from-sample, inexpensive commercial system. This is achieved by using commercial MNPs to isolate microorganisms from clinical samples such as blood culture broth, urine, sputum etc., and re-suspending the pathogens in specified volumes of growth media to obtain a suspension containing optimized concentrations of bacteria. Pathogen growth or death is then monitored using m-EIS in microfluidic cards where they are exposed to a range of antibiotic concentrations. The result is a phenotypic antibiotic susceptibility (AST) profile, yielding the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of multiple candidate antibiotics within 4 hours of sample collection. The AST and MIC information is then used to treat infections with targeted therapeutic. The first products utilizing this system\/method will focus on urine and positive blood culture broth samples.

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase II project will benefit society by reducing the cost of manufacturing biologic pharmaceuticals and improving their quality, including pharmaceuticals that are currently too costly to manufacture because they target relatively small patient populations. In order to accelerate the availability of newly discovered drugs, the pharmaceutical industry and federal regulatory agencies have identified a great need for advances in process analytical technologies (PATs) in biomanufacturing. This project will advance state-of-the-art PAT by providing a continuous in-situ sensor enabling novel methods of drug quality assurance. This multi-analyte sensor will allow biopharmaceutical companies, for the first time, to monitor the concentration of the product in-situ as it is being produced along with the concentrations of other important cell culture conditions. This ability unlocks new avenues for optimizing biopharmaceutical production which consumes about 35% of the biologic drug cost-of-goods. Efficient control of upstream processes using sensors such as the one proposed here is expected to reduce these costs by up to 30%. Furthermore, this technology can be directed towards other analytes by replacing the bound affinity ligands. Thus, this technology can be used as a sensing platform in biopharmaceutical manufacturing or medical diagnostics, food processing, and water quality monitoring. This project will advance scientific knowledge of biosensing, hydrogel chemistry, and process analytics by developing the first continuous monoclonal antibody (mAbs) sensor suitable for biomanufacturing. Remarkable progress has been made in developing affinity ligands that specifically bind to targets, but thus far the primary application has been medical therapeutics. This project will develop a biosensor adapting affinity ligands, aptamers in particular, for the first time for application in bioprocess monitoring. This will be accomplished by synthesizing the first antibody-responsive hydrogel containing covalently attached peptide aptamers. Each of the four objectives will focus on hydrogels, electronics, software and system validation respectively. The mAb biosensor will be capable of monitoring quality and yield of mAbs besides the key parameters: pH, osmolality, glucose, and lactate in cell culture environments. This novel hydrogel will be the basis for the first in-situ bioreactor sensor for real-time antibody measurements during biomanufacturing. This adaptable technology can be leveraged towards a number of protein targets; thus, this project represents a transformative approach that will advance scientific knowledge of biosensing across a multitude of applications. Thus, the proposed sensor array will be a powerful tool to advance process analytics and biomanufacturing.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will provide commercial validation at scale of feedback-based control of arc behavior within the vacuum arc remelting (VAR) process. This will improve VAR performance in the production of specialty metals, resulting in improvements to ingot quality while reducing electricity consumption. Specialty metals, such as titanium and nickel alloys, are used in critical high-performance parts in industries such as aerospace, energy, and medicine, where the failure of these parts may lead to catastrophic systems failures and potentially life-threatening situations. In a VAR furnace, extreme temperature gradients from constricted and\/or diffuse arcs sustained between the melting electrode and ingot can cause non-homogeneous material and inclusion defects, resulting in up to 8% yield loss per ingot, representing $1.024 billion in losses across the domestic industry. Improved control over the arc distributions during the melting of these metals is expected to decrease the frequency of defects in the final product and increase overall yield from the process. The proposed project is expected to reduce these loses by up to 50% through the application of active, feedback control of the arc dynamics. This type of control is expected to increase yield, decrease energy requirements, and increase safety of the manufacturing process industry-wide. This project will result in a system capable of detecting and manipulating the distribution of the arcs utilized during VAR processing. The Phase I effort showed that it is possible to simultaneously detect arc locations on the electrode and influence their movements, using electromagnetic coils, in real time. In Phase II, the arc measurements will be coupled through feedback to control the arc distribution in an industrial-scale research VAR, providing proof of concept at industrial scale. In so doing, the optimal electromagnetic coil geometry, hardware, and materials for driving the arc motion at scale will be identified and constructed. A series of industrial experiments are planned to validate the control system. The chemical composition of the ingots produced during controlled and uncontrolled conditions will be characterized to correlate defects with observed arc behaviors and to identify optimal control parameters. Similarly, the measured arc distributions will be used to validate the computational solidification modeling, which will be used to identify probable defect regions. The combination of experimental data and validated simulation results will be used to inform the VAR feedback control system regarding optimal arc distribution, yielding an improved control strategy for tailoring the melt process and improving ingot quality.

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will result in a significant improvement in the performance, power, and cost of deploying machine learning (ML) solutions through horizontal platform technologies that enable many vertical applications. This improvement will accelerate deployment of intelligent systems and improve scalability through localized intelligence. Our technology automates hardware design, implementation, and deployment to Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) platforms. Our initial target verticals: Security and Surveillance, Predictive Maintenance, and Healthcare represent hundreds of billions USD in growth markets for IoT devices and substantially more economic impact through improved efficiency in deployment and operations and reduced societal costs. Improved performance, power consumption and scalability of these key technologies will lead to improved public safety, improved intelligence in home healthcare services, and more efficient manufacturing and energy systems through deployment of Predictive Maintenance technologies on key industrial equipment. Wide deployment of these technologies will lead to substantial energy savings and a corresponding reduction in carbon emissions, reduced economic loss due to negative events, improved scalability and response time to predicted or active negative events, and lower cost in deployment and operations due to low cost, low power, and physically small sensor systems. The proposed project focuses on design of high performance, energy-efficient platforms for ML applications, and associated design tools and libraries. Neural networks are heavily used for many machine learning problems but optimizing for efficient deployment currently requires extensive trial-and-error for the large design space of options. Our deep neural network (DNN) optimization framework applies bit-width optimizations, weight sharing and pruning automatically to reduce computation and weight storage demands by more than 10X, while analyzing quality of results impact and using fine-tuned retraining to minimize or eliminate accuracy degradation. Our high level synthesis (HLS) tool then translates optimized networks to hardware while applying pipelining, functional unit parallelism, resource sharing, and platform-specific optimizations. Together these tools automate and accelerate the process of analyzing, optimizing and implementing ML for hardware deployment, reducing time and required expertise for hardware design. Our deployment platforms are modular, composable platforms for small, low-cost deployments of audio\/video signal processing, feature extraction and classification, systems control (e.g. pan-tilt-zoom cameras), and communications to decision-making or cloud services. We will extend competitive advantages from our Phase I project with features for solutions in the security\/surveillance, predictive maintenance, and healthcare verticals, and tight integration of platforms, tools and IP libraries.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project targets the fabrication of devices capable of focusing X-rays with high energy (from 10 keV to above 100 keV) to spot sizes as small as 7 nanometers. This capability is critical for imaging, microtomography, and elemental and structural analyses of materials and will permit imaging in spectral ranges and at resolutions unavailable today. These devices will enable scientists to better image the interplay of structure and functionality for a wide variety of applications, including the development of life-saving drugs, the creation of materials for high-tech devices, and for a number of important basic scientific purposes. The devices? primary use will be in high-end synchrotron radiation facilities and in X-ray microscopes with in specialized industrial and research environments. These devices form a special class of high-value consumables, addressing a global market segment worth about $7 million today with the potential to increase to more than $14 million in the near future. The intellectual merit of this project is threefold. First, the innovative method of fabrication explores and exploits the ultimate capability of atomic layer deposition (ALD) for achieving nanometer-scale smoothness in very thick, multilayer films. Unlike related methods that rely on deposition onto wires and slicing, this method uses ALD to deposit sequences of low and high refractive index materials onto batch-fabricated cylindrical silicon precursors, with well-controlled layer thicknesses varying from a few nanometers to tens of nanometers. Subsequently, polishing the wafer will yield membranes with hundreds of high-value focusing devices on a single wafer, minimizing the processing costs per device. Second, the envisioned wafer-level processing method allows for a necessary tilt control of the precursors, not possible with wires, for better focusing properties. Third, the method is extendable towards depositing sequences of more-than-two material layers, which enables the fabrication of step-wise graded index diffractive devices with single foci and featuring ultimate diffraction efficiency. Phase I qualified the individual key processes and proved their integration capability into a complete fabrication sequence, while Phase II will deal with the fabrication and testing of prototypes and preparation for production, using long runs of atomic layer deposition processes, as is necessary for functional devices. This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will enable video-rate three-dimensional (3D) imaging within two-photon microscopes (2PMs) by developing novel deformable membrane mirror (DMM) technology for fast, precise focus control. As a subset of laser scanning microscopes (LSMs), 2PMs achieve very high spatial resolution by using a focused, high-power laser beam to excite fluorescence via the simultaneous absorption of two low-energy infrared photons to stimulate emission in the visible spectrum. Because of the increased resolution, and increased penetration of infrared light into tissue compared with other LSM methods, 2PMs have become widely accepted for use in the life sciences, specifically for neuroscience. The DMM technology developed for this project will address the $165 million 2PM market by delivering an electrically tunable optic capable of simultaneously controlling focus and aberrations while operating an order of magnitude faster than competitive technologies. The 3D imaging capabilities enabled by this technology will propel new research in the field of neuroscience aimed at solving widespread, chronic medical problems like stroke and Alzheimer&apos;s disease. Once the 2PM entry market is addressed, this technology will be refined to address the much larger $5.8 billion 3D laser printing market. During the Phase I project, new mirror coatings were developed to handle the high-power lasers used in 2PMs. With the core DMM technology in place, this Phase II project is aimed primarily at control of mirror actuation and shape for reliable use in 2PMs. The first objective of this Phase II project will develop electronics for robust control of mirror actuation and shape. Objective two will center on refining the core DMM technology and fabrication methods to enable position sensing of the membrane and improve mirror stroke to satisfy customers in 2PM markets. The final objective will involve the creation of optical and mechanical assemblies and modules for incorporating the DMM technology into key microscopes. The result of this Phase II will be a market-ready DMM product with active focus control to address the growing 2PM market.

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this SBIR Phase II project is to deliver a bio-based and functionally improved optical polymer that can be made into a lens. The lens product has commercial applications in rapidly growing mass-markets like Prescription eyewear that is growing significantly due to onslaught of myopia. Using scientific data, this proposal demonstrates an improved commercial product for myopia when compared to Polycarbonate, the most popular eyewear material in US. Work proposed in Phase II focuses on development of the polymer at large scale and its conversion to lenses using a lower-cost, one-step molding process that can also reduce current industry wastages by as much as an estimated 90%. For establishing suitability of the product towards commercial applications, the Phase II goals include product testing in lab as well as with real subjects to generate marketable data. Finished prescription lenses are a ~$30 billion plus market, with ~70% of lens sales serving myopic patients, who will see a tremendous benefit from using our ultra-clear lens. Broader impact of this technology proposal is to make eyeglasses exponentially more affordable in contrast to today&apos;s high costs. Price controls exerted by market monopolies like Luxottica and Essilor on finished lenses pose a huge barrier to base of pyramid markets. Our easy-to-make lens technology simplifies the eyewear supply chain for benefit of these unconventional markets and can lower costs dramatically for billions of people around the world, who are separated by a pair of glasses from otherwise blindness. This SBIR Phase II project proposes to leverage properties of sugars to build an optically clear, transparent polymer of good refractive index, low dispersion and low density. In commercial applications of this polymer as a prescription lens, it thus represents a state-of-the-art product that combines the best properties of various incumbent eyewear materials into one. A key intellectual merit of this SBIR project is to achieve a plastic with optical properties similar to glass, a gold standard in optical materials. Our chemistry platform is 90% bio-based, a unique value proposition in prescription lens industry, where use of extremely toxic and hazardous chemicals is common. Phase I work has also led to the development of a novel route of manufacturing lenses which can lower cost barriers for setting up optical labs, expedite the process for making prescription lenses and cut wastages in current prescription industry. In Phase II, our goal is to methodically develop the process for making lenses using Novol&apos;s polymers and obtain data to translate the proposed technology to a commercially preferred lens product with special benefits to myopic patients.

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase II project will develop a personalized learning environment for guiding students in effective use of educational sketching in Science Technology Engineering and Math (STEM). There is an estimated need for 1 million more STEM professionals in the U.S. over the next decade. However, the dropout rate for students in STEM majors ranges from 48% to 69%. Recent reform in mathematics education in the U.S. has focused on sketching and modeling so that students have a better understanding of the problems they are solving rather than rote memorization. Sketching is also important for improving the ability to visualize three dimensional shapes in engineering, medicine, and science. Teaching sketching has been shown to increase retention in STEM by over 50% among students entering college with low spatial visualization skills, especially among women and other underrepresented minorities. However, the traditional method of sketching on paper requires teaching expertise and classroom time, which has limited its use. Our touchscreen software will improve upon sketching on paper, by providing immediate feedback and intelligent hints when students are stuck. A key advantage of our approach is that it can reward persistence by having students retry a sketching assignment until they get it right, as opposed to multiple-choice questions that can only be tried once. Impact will include improved conceptual understanding in K-6 mathematics and STEM education at all levels. This project will develop an intelligent learning environment where students can freehand sketch on a touchscreen phone, tablet, or computer. They will receive personalized feedback based on the sketches they draw to improve their conceptual understanding and promote persistence. The software algorithms developed will automatically grade student sketches and provide hints that are just enough to keep the student engaged but not so much as to give away the solution. An expert teacher knows that developing skill and increasing persistence requires that students struggle a bit as they overcome obstacles to learn new concepts. The algorithm for interpreting student sketches and providing hints will mimic an expert teacher looking over the shoulder of the student. By interpreting student intent in their sketches, the algorithm will be able to distinguish between intentional marks and unintentional ones that are due to poor coordination or sloppiness. Subject areas include elementary school mathematics, spatial visualization for 7-12th grade technical education, post-secondary vocational and engineering programs, and eventually physics, geology, medicine and other STEM areas. This project will replace sketching on paper and pencil with widely available touchscreens, and make educational sketching more effective and engaging.

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this project is to increase overall crop health and production with the proposed smartphone compatible crop health sensor. More specifically, crop disease remains a significant threat to global food security, and with the ability to perform pre-visual screening, the proposed platform enables cost efficient, quantitative detection of crop disease, empowering farmers to take action to reduce disease impact. Initially the sensor platform provides a timely solution for cost effective, high throughput, and pre-visual screening of citrus Huanglongbing disease (HLB), enabling citrus growers to effectively manage HLB in their groves and remain profitable. The pre-visual, cost efficient and quantitative detection capability also translates to detection of diseases in other crops. In addition, the sensing technology developed can be used for quantitative assessment of crop nutrient and water stress, enabling farmers to optimally manage crop health, providing a means to optimize profits, increase crop yields, and reduce environmental impacts. This is critical to ensuring national and global food security, and protecting national water supplies by reducing eutrophication of water bodies due to misdiagnosis and mistreatment of crop stressors. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project is built upon Atoptix?s patented compact self-referenced spectrophotometer design, which reduces the size and cost of an optical spectrophotometer to enable field use and integration with smartphone technology. For each spectral measurement, the sensor simultaneously records a self-referenced spectrum, retaining the sensitivity and reliability generally reserved for costlier and bulkier spectrophotometer designs, but also enabling a non-technical user to collect data in the field at the push of a button. Distinct from surface reflection methods, the proposed sensor enables pre-visual detection of a pathogen, as it only captures light that has penetrated inside of a leaf and interacted with internal structures. By lowering the cost of the optical sensor through patented designs, increasing ease of use via a smartphone, and joining the precision of optical spectroscopy with machine learning based analytics, the proposed sensor can enable widespread adoption by growers in disease prone regions, where community wide screening is key for protecting grower assets.

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/ commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project includes reducing emission of Diesel engines&apos; toxic nitrogen oxides (NOx) in challengingly low temperature exhaust operations, while eliminating damaging urea deposits saving warranty costs for vehicle manufacturers, saving fuel, reducing greenhouse gases CO2 and N2O as well as particulate matter, while potentially enabling downsizing the complex and costly diesel emission control systems. The novel technology developed in this SBIR project may be configured for retrofitting existing diesel platforms. Nitrogen oxides pose risks to human respiratory and pulmonary systems, are associated with forming ground level ozone, photochemical oxidants, acid rain and fine particles, amongst a variety of their detriments, and their emission is therefore regulated. Our concept, when successful, will therefore make available a broad value proposition to the society, the environment and to the mobility industry. Finally, the insights developed into its gas phase reactions may have applications in other branches of science and technology. This SBIR Phase II project proposes to resolve a currently unmet need in mitigating emission of toxic nitrogen oxides (NOx) from diesel engines, especially in low exhaust temperatures such as when the vehicle operates in stop-and-go, in local delivery or when idles its engine. The goal of this project is to develop a low cost, easy-to-fit and simple-to-integrate novel technology enabling low temperature Diesel NOx reduction. Continuing our successful Phase I research results, in this Phase II project more advanced prototypes will be developed and tested in low-temperature exhaust conditions, demonstrating rapid reduction of NOx on a commercially-available Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) catalyst, while evaluating the impact on lowering greenhouse gases CO2 and N2O. High fidelity computer simulations will be heavily utilized to further our understanding of underlying mechanisms such as the gas-phase reactions as well as to accelerate the development path. The project outcome is expected to alleviate a remaining challenge in Diesel emission control and to be rapidly welcome by the Diesel engine and vehicle industry.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will demonstrate an additive manufacturing process to produce 3-D woven textile products at scale. Presently, the clothing manufacturing industry still relies on manual sewing machines that were invented over one-hundred and seventy years ago. This system limits the manufacturing process and textile capability; an abundance of steps leads to waste, inefficiencies, and segmented products. Further, due to the low cost of foreign labor, the US textile industry has effectively come to a halt: 97.3 percent of all clothing sold in the United States in 2015 was imported. This project seeks to develop a novel method for manufacturing woven textile products by employing additive manufacturing methodologies to automate the production process, while simultaneously enabling complete customization and on-demand production. This technology will enable premium and competitive textile manufacturing to return from overseas, creating high value-added jobs and a designer community in the United States while also generating tax revenue. In the same way that 3-D printing technology has revolutionized the hard goods manufacturing process, this project seeks to create an entire new industry of additively manufactured textile products, enabling significant opportunities for future innovation. This project develops a novel technology to manufacture near-net-shape three dimensional woven textile products. To develop this technology, this project first proved feasibility through creating constituent textile panels of non-standard shapes with 3-D topography in Phase I, laying the foundation for continued development into fully three-dimensional, seamless, finished products produced in-situ through Phase II. By additively producing garments from a unique 3-D model complete customization to each individual consumer is possible on a large scale, though this has never before been accomplished. Further, through the on-demand production of clothing customized to individual consumers, the need for substantial inventory buildup is eliminated. In this way, additively manufactured textile products are both more desirable to consumers and more economical to producers. As such, the societal and environmental benefits of automated and on-demand textile manufacturing within the United States are significant, including eliminating massive amounts of waste from typical cut-and-sew manufacturing techniques, revamping a struggling American manufacturing industry, and minimizing the economical, environmental, and geopolitical implications of the United States? current dependence on a convoluted global supply chain. This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to make the &apos;green&apos; solar industry truly green. As the deployment of solar modules expands rapidly, so will module wastes. The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) estimates that module wastes will appear in large quantities by early 2030&apos;s and by 2050 they will total 78 million tonnes. Today most module wastes end up in landfills. This SBIR project will develop a technology to maximize the revenue from module recycling. It has the potential to enable a profitable recycling business without any government subsidy. By recovering all the valuable components in modules, our technology has the potential to generate up to $60 billion in revenue from 78 million tonnes of modules. The proposed project develops sustainable recycling processes and related equipment for silicon solar cells and modules. The goal of the project is to separate and recover all the valuable, toxic, and bulky components in cells and modules including solar-grade silicon, silver, lead, copper, aluminum, tin, and glass. The target for solar-grade silicon recovery is 85% and the target for metal recovery, especially silver, is over 90%. The revenue from recycling, based on today&apos;s prices for solar-grade silicon and silver, is $15\/module by our technology, as compared to $3.50\/module by today&apos;s technology. The primary work of this project will be developing a prototype for silicon solar cell recycling and optimizing the process for a production environment. The target throughput of the prototype is up to 50 kg of solar cell wastes per day.

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to create an economical, light&amp;#8208;weight, high performance Terahertz (THz) spectrometer to allow testing of air and fossil fuels for the presence of harmful compounds. A frequency domain THz spectrometer is capable of characterizing the different molecules and chemicals in a gas sample. Historically these spectrometers have been relegated to the laboratory because of their size and complexity but recent technical advancements have made it possible to build a spectroscopic THz sensor small enough and light enough to be flown on a consumer drone. The reductions in size and cost have opened the door to using THz sensors for emissions testing of ships entering U.S. waters or contaminant testing of fossil fuels at petroleum processing facilities. This is significant because the ability to analyze samples locally removes the time and expense of collecting and shipping potentially dangerous compounds (i.e. flammable compounds or pollutants) to a laboratory for analysis. It also allows detection and classification to occur on short notice and without the need to subject personnel to the local environment. The proposed project will produce the first article of a compact, battery operated, autonomously operating spectroscopic THz sensor capable of mixed gas analysis to parts per million sensitivities. It will be constructed predominantly from economical off&amp;#8208;the&amp;#8208;shelf fiber optic components in a novel highly compact, light&amp;#8208;weight form factor. In order to achieve the high sensitivities, the spectroscopic THz sensor will incorporate: high fidelity lasers from the telecommunications industry, custom designed and fabricated high efficiency, hermetically sealed photomixers, a folded, light&amp;#8208;weight, carbon fiber sample cell incorporating patented 3D printed mirror technology and a patented optical phase&amp;#8208;modulation technique that removes the effects of coherent detection. The instrument will first be employed for laboratory based measurements of sulfur-containing contaminants in gas flows. Upon the successful demonstration of the capabilities of the instrument, a first article will be used in initial testing and collaborative field work. Sales of a larger laboratory instrument based on the same technology will begin simultaneously.

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this project will address two societal needs. It will enable mass charging infrastructure for electric vehicles (EVs) at minimal cost, and will enable the provisioning of energy services to help integrate renewable energy sources. This is critical as electricity generation and transportation together consume close to two-thirds of all US energy and emit more than half of all US greenhouse gases. To drastically reduce greenhouse gases will therefore require electrification of our transportation and renewable generation of our electricity. California (CA) has a mandate to have 1.5 million zero-emission vehicles by 2025 and, currently, half of the nation&apos;s EVs are in CA. If the project is successful, the proposed technology, when deployed at scale, can potentially save CA $144M annually in operating costs and $1.1B in capital cost when CA reaches its ambitious goal by 2025. This can help reduce greenhouse gases annually in CA by 5.5 million metric tons. This project will therefore make an impact in both clean transportation and clean energy. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project will develop an adaptive EV charging system that can implement a number of innovations that are not currently available in the EV charging industry. It will offer a site host a solution to recover costs, jointly optimize onsite distributed energy resources such as solar panels and battery banks, minimize operating cost for site host and charging cost for drivers, and optimally trade off preferences and constraints of different drivers and of the site host, subject to infrastructure capacity constraints. These technologies will be based on unique real-time sensing, communications, and control capabilities, as well as advanced optimization and learning algorithms. These technologies will provide a target charging capacity at minimal infrastructure and operating costs, as well as a platform for energy services to the grid.

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop an instrument platform that will facilitate development and translation of next generation diagnostics and therapeutics that are based on a class of nanovesicles called extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs, which are nanoparticles shed by cells, are being investigated for early detection of diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegenerative disorders, from biofluids without the need of invasive tissue biopsies. The lack of tools and techniques to perform high-throughput characterization of EVs is limiting translation. The platform under development will enable an understanding EVs produced by cells. The global market for nanoparticle analysis instrumentation in the life sciences is estimated at $5.9 Billion. The EV market, which is a subset of this market, is rapidly growing, with a predicted compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 47.3% over the next five years. Biological nanoparticles are playing an increasing role in life science applications and better, target-specific, faster tools are needed to characterize them in a high-throughput way. This SBIR Phase II project will complete the development of an instrument platform to enable Extracellular Vesicle (EV) measurements and characterization. The platform will include a customer configurable consumable, eliminating the requirement for an expensive custom robotic arrayer step, removing barriers to end-user adoption and decentralizing discovery. Also, long-term shelf-life of the consumable will be established. In addition, improvements into the imaging platform will enable visualization of the smallest nanoparticles, relaxing the complexity and cost of the platform and providing a functional advantage over competitive offerings. The platform will automate much of the workflow, reducing operator hands-on time. The resulting platform will enable EV measurements with 5X-to-30X less sample volume, detect 100X-to-10,000X less concentrated targets, and increase throughput by using a workflow that bypasses purification requirements needed by other techniques. The completion of these objectives will result in a life science research tool for researchers and industry working on EV-based diagnostics and therapeutics.

        "abstract": "Sepsis is a poorly understood clinical syndrome and is characterized by a dysregulation of the immune system?s response to infection. It is the leading cause of death and is the most expensive condition treated in U.S. hospitals, exerting a $20.3 billion burden annually, 5.2% of total costs to the healthcare system nationwide. Sepsis is highly time critical and every 1-hour delay in antibiotics is associated with a 3-7% increase in the odds of a poor outcome. There is currently a dire need for a tool that can quickly assess if a patient is at risk for sepsis. Such a tool would ideally gather any relevant information very quickly and provide a probability of sepsis directly back to the physician in less than 30 minutes. If this tool were available, a lot of the uncertainty revolving around early sepsis screening could be minimized. Outcomes such as mortality, readmission rate, length of stay, length of ICU stay, hospital cost, and compliance to Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services Core Measures could all be improved by such a tool. The goal of the SBIR Phase I project was to establish the feasibility of a point of care sensor that can measure cells and proteins from a drop of blood for the eventual stratification of sepsis. In Phase II, work will continue with our manufacturing partners to design, optimize, and test a one-time-use cartridge and a portable reader for the simultaneous measurement of cells and proteins from a small volume of blood. The objective will be to develop a scalable technology platform, that can measure total white blood cell count, CD64 expression on neutrophils, and 2 proteins (IL-6, and PCT), simultaneously from the same drop of blood, and also be able to measure different proteins by changing the types of beads used in the assay. The goal is to allow physicians and healthcare providers to perform frequent measurements at the point of care, and to integrate the clinical and biological data to predict sepsis and organ dysfunction. The result of this project will be a fully functional reader and accompanying disposable cartridges for the measurement of these critical sepsis biomarkers.

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase II project focuses on advancing the domestic manufacturing capabilities for high-value nanomaterials for new membrane materials. Previously, the company has developed a novel membrane material with considerable economic, environmental, and nutritional impact in industrial process applications. Commercially available nanofiltration (NF) membrane systems employ polymer membranes, which have inherent chemical and thermal intolerance and are therefore difficult to clean or cannot be used in all separation streams. Meanwhile, 12% of US energy consumption is dedicated to thermal separations, a number that can be cut by a factor of 10 with appropriate physical separation technologies. This technology has applications across food &amp; beverage processing, pharmaceutical production, semiconductor manufacturing, and chemical\/petrochemical refining. Creating nanometer-scale features on large areas (tens of square meters) will enable technical opportunities for a multitude of products and applications. In this SBIR Phase II project, the company is conducting process development, pilot demonstration, and scale up efforts toward coating graphene oxide thin films for nanofiltration membrane separations applications. Today?s membrane processes are limited by the selectivity and durability of the nanofiltration membrane. Improved selectivity and operational conditions from the material platform enables improved downstream processes, and new product development. The technology is tolerant to elevated temperatures, extreme pH, organic and chlorinated solvents, and high levels of oxidizers. Transitioning from thermal separations to membrane separations saves 90% of the required energy. Meanwhile, payback time is &lt; 3 months when improving clean-in-place (CIP) protocol for existing NF processes. This is a game changer for the separations industry. Key separations of interest include desalting, whey concentration, sugar fractionation, fatty acid separation, nutraceutical extraction, pharmaceutical purification and black liquor concentration.

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to provide a solution to the problem of drinking water contamination by developing an advanced adsorbent for point-of-use\/home filtration applications. Micropollutants, pharmaceutical residues, pesticides, industrial chemicals and other organic compounds present in water resources at trace concentrations of one part per billion and less, are recognized as a major factor of contamination. Consumers around the world no longer trust the safety of their drinking water due to the presence of micropollutants and other contaminants. These compounds are pervasive and can present toxicity at trace concentrations. As a result, consumers have significantly increased the non-sustainable use of plastic bottled water, now a $260 billion market. Current point-of-use filtration products are primarily designed to improve taste and odor, and are generally ineffective in removing micropollutants. CycloPure&apos;s technology has been developed specifically to target and remove micropollutants from water. This project focuses on the further development of the company&apos;s cyclodextrin adsorbent to improve the effectiveness of point-of-use filters. This material can be used as a drop-in replacement without changes in filter design. CycloPure&apos;s materials will allow households to safely use readily available tap water. This SBIR Phase II project proposes to identify strategies to develop a suitable form factor to incorporate CycloPure&apos;s high-affinity cyclodextrin adsorbent into point-of-use filters. The company&apos;s adsorbent is formed by reacting cyclodextrins, which are derived from corn starch, with readily available monomers in a single step process. During the Phase I period of this project, scalable reaction conditions were identified for production of the adsorbent in powder form. Flow-through applications, such as gravity filters, frequently require granular particles to achieve desired flow rates. Early activities will focus on the preparation of the adsorbent in granular form to demonstrate scalability and retention of removal performance similar to powder form. Thereafter, column studies will be performed in order to assess the removal performance of granular media under flow-through conditions at environmentally relevant micropollutant concentrations. Following identification of adsorption characteristics and appropriate flow conditions, a prototype point-of-use filter will be constructed and tested for the removal of micropollutants from tap water using advanced analytical techniques, including a combination of target and non-target screening approaches.

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase II project aims to transform intravenous (IV) infusions of biologic medicines into simple subcutaneous (SC) injections. Biologics have improved the treatment of human disease. Unfortunately, their delivery is burdensome. The standard of administration of these biologics is often by IV infusion at low concentrations, which can take multiple hours to deliver, cause patient discomfort, and increase the risk of infection. Although SC injection is preferred, constraints on SC volume (1.5-2.0 mL) would necessitate concentrations much greater than 100 mg\/mL, which are often unfeasible. Solutions at concentrations exceeding 100 mg\/mL are highly viscous (honey-like), making them difficult to inject and leading to unstable products. This project&apos;s microparticle suspension technology can deliver high concentrations while fully preserving the protein structure, function, and efficacy. Transforming the delivery of biologics offers advantages to patients, healthcare providers, payers, and biopharmaceutical companies. Patients will experience less pain and discomfort, save time, have fewer infections, and have better access to biologics. Healthcare providers will be able to process more patients, decrease the chance of complications, and use fewer human resources. Payers will have decreased reimbursement costs. Biopharmaceutical companies will have patented product differentiation and the ability to develop otherwise intractable biologics. This SBIR Phase II project aims to develop a soft atomization manufacturing platform for the production of microparticle suspensions capable of transforming intravenous (IV) infusions of biologics into simple subcutaneous (SC) injections. The standard of administration of biologics is intravenous infusion at low concentrations, which can take hours to deliver, cause patient discomfort, and increase the risk of infection.

Solutions at concentrations exceeding 100 mg\/mL are highly viscous (honey-like), making them difficult to inject and leading to unstable products. This project&apos;s gently processed microparticle suspensions can deliver high concentrations while preserving protein structure and bioactivity, an accomplishment not well-demonstrated with other microparticle technologies. This project aims to advance the readiness level of the innovation by performing process calibration of a bench-scale system, followed by developing and characterizing the resulting particles and suspensions produced on that system. With well-formulated suspensions, in vivo pharmacokinetic and efficacy studies will commence. The project will support the development of manufacturing capabilities towards a goal of transitioning to pilot-scale production. This project aims to offer advantages to patients, healthcare providers, payers, and biopharmaceutical companies.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop a suite of screen-printed receive coils for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), that are flexible, lightweight, low-cost and adapted to the entire population from infants to adults. MRI is widely used to establish a broad variety of clinical diagnosis, but suffers from long examination times and a high rate of failure, resulting in a yearly loss of more than $4 billion in the United States alone. Printed receive coils are extremely flexible, lightweight, and conform well to the human body. With this technology, coils can be designed and manufactured inexpensively to fit all patient sizes, thus improving image quality and enabling robust acceleration of the method. These benefits can contribute to increase the success rate of MRI exams, speed up procedure time, enhance the clinical workflow, and reduce equipment costs. Printed coils will improve the quality of care offered by MRI suites and increase the availability and use of MRI to a wider patient population. Overall, this project will develop a clinical-ready system capable of delivering the full economic and clinical benefits of printed coils, which will contribute to a reduction of the healthcare costs associated with MRI. This project aims to fully realize a clinical-ready system consisting of a collection of printed, flexible lightweight MRI coil arrays, and connecting to a single universal cable to interface with the MRI scanner. A first part of the project will focus on the design of the cable and the associated connection scheme allowing interchange of multiple printed coil arrays of different sizes. Different strategies will be examined with the intent of maintaining high performance and safety while maximizing the advantages brought by printing. A second project goal will focus on the development of a collection of printed coil arrays for patient sizes ranging from newborn to adult, that are compatible with the universal cable and for both 3T and 1.5T scanners. The arrays will be designed for body imaging and will consist of 32-channel devices divided into 16-channel posterior and anterior portions. Their performance will be compared to a commercial 32-channel product. The final system will meet all the safety requirements for medical use and will be ready to be manufactured at scale.

The resulting technologies will provide 2-way connectivity where cellular does not exist and where other techniques (Satellite) are too expensive. This will result in near universal availability of the Internet-of-Things at costs superior to legacy approaches and which are appropriate for applications typically seen in Internet-of-Things applications. Further, the work will have broad impact in allowing more balanced utilization of the radio spectrum which cannot be addressed (either economically or at all) with legacy wireless techniques. The proposed project will create a new system of hardware, software, frequency and operating techniques which will allow underutilized spectrum to be used to deliver 2-way communications to very remote machines and things. The work will build on our Phase I accomplishments to create production-ready designs of two new wireless systems, signal processing software to allow use of challenging spectrum while avoiding existing users, create the first instance of a cloud based infrastructure for automated control and coordination of our architecture, and, the creation of a basic set of deployment tools and techniques to support field operations.

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will result from group chat technology that enables knowledge workers to collaborate more effectively than ever before. It is the first tool built that empowers users to efficiently carry out both real-time and asynchronous conversations in the same system, with each user reading only those conversations that are important to him or her. In particular, the technology empowers teams to make decisions in virtual meetings that take place asynchronously over periods of hours or days. This is in contrast with existing group chat technology, where conversations usually end as soon as someone starts talking about something else. This ability to conduct long running, virtual meetings is invaluable for large teams that need to coordinate work across different locations and time zones. Large, distributed teams are fast becoming the norm for how organizations operate, as instant communication and globalization make such teams the workforce of the future. Coordinating the efforts of such teams is a huge pain point for companies, and this technology is a leap in the state of the art in this space. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project has three major research objectives: scaling the technology to teams of 10,000+ people; faithfully translating the user experience to mobile devices; and developing techniques for serving the needs of diverse deployments large and small. For scalability, one major area is &quot;presence&quot;, telling each user who else is currently online. Presence data naturally grows with the number of pairs of users, therefore much faster than the number of users, and the company will need to develop algorithms to focus presence on significant connections between users. Among the unique challenges on mobile, the often-limited Internet connectivity demands algorithms that remember data previously fetched from the server to avoid asking for it again, carefully balanced with getting needed updates to never show out-of-date information to the user; the immediacy required for a great chat experience makes both horns of this dilemma especially sharp. Serving diverse deployments demands techniques for making software updates routine and seamless, a practice recently popularized in browsers and mobile apps but rarely accomplished to date in distributing server applications such as that described here.

The proposed project will develop a computational imaging system that allows for high-resolution 3D microgeometry and reflectance properties measurement of object surfaces. The current approaches for 3D surface measurement at the micron scale are based on sophisticated optical and mechanical components that are expensive and can be difficult to use, and most of these approaches cannot capture the full appearance of a surface, such as diffuse reflection, specular reflection, and surface roughness. The goal of this research program is to develop a combination of hardware and software that can measure 3D surface microgeometry and reflectance properties with micron-scale accuracy. The proposed technology is expected to achieve superior performance at greatly reduced cost.

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase II project is a significant reduction in the cost and time to remove hazardous contaminants from the soils and groundwater impacting communities. Properties observed from thousands of contaminated sites serve as inputs to a computerized mathematical model of the site, forecasting the most likely shape and depth of a contaminant plume. This machine learning model gives remediation planners access to a fast delineation of volume to be remediated as well as the uncertainty of the modeled estimate. This saves time and money searching for these contaminants that are deep underground and in groundwater. This Phase II project will expand on the Phase I prototype, creating an operational product capable of reaching the needs of environmental engineers and scientists around the globe, providing the stimulus to cut remediation time and cost in half.

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is to enable organizations - whether businesses, governments, or non-profits - to make more informed, more data-driven decisions. All organizations must decide how to allocate limited resources and do so in the context of meeting a set of objectives, such as profit, social wellbeing, or health. Modeling as a process and models as artifacts of that process allow decision makers to understand data through the lens of objectives and to then make decisions; data alone, no matter how much, cannot make decisions. As more aspects of the world are instrumented and captured digitally, the breadth and quantity of data will out of necessity require larger, more complex models to be built. Organizations will need a modeling workflow and supporting tools that scale with these demands. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the challenge of many users collaboratively building and maintaining analytical models that are consistent and reproducible while allowing for divergent and convergent change. This project will address the resource management challenges identified in development and the interactivity gaps identified in user testing of the Phase I prototype. The result will be a commercial software application for building models that manages code, data, and the evolution of both over time by many users.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is focused on the development of a lithium metal battery using a novel Liquefied Gas Electrolyte. While there is an intense global effort to advance electrolyte chemistry for next-generation lithium batteries, these efforts focus almost entirely on liquid and solid-state electrolytes. In contrast, this project aims to further develop the use of a novel class of electrolytes which use solvents that are typically gaseous at room temperature and liquefied under moderate pressures. Phase I work demonstrated world-record cycling lithium metal with an average plating\/stripping coulombic efficiency of &gt;99.5% over 400 cycles with (0.5 mA\/cm2 and 0.5 mAh\/cm2 each cycle) with smooth and highly dense lithium deposition as observed through cryogenic focused-ion-beam characterization. Further, a world-record low temperature electrolytic conductivity of 3 mS\/cm at -80 ?C for lithium-based electrolytes was obtained, far exceeding the state-of-art. Lastly, a reversible high temperature shut-down at +40 ?C, due to a decrease in electrolyte conductivity from salt precipitation, was demonstrated. This high temperature shut-down essentially eliminates thermal runaway reaction from occurring, making for a significantly safer battery. Further development of these electrolytes through this NSF Phase II grant will enable further work to increase battery specific energy to 450 Wh\/kg, expand operating temperatures from -60 to +60 ?C, and increased safety with no thermal runaway while maintaining power and cycle life comparable to conventional Li-ion. This will be accomplished with further development of the electrolyte chemistry to improve lithium metal coulombic efficiency to &gt;99.8% over 1000 cycles, increase the high temperature shut-down to +60~70 ?C, increasing cathode performance to higher voltages and cycle life, and the development of a high throughput R&amp;D line which will offer high precision addition of electrolyte components to fine tune the chemistry. Because the electrolyte chemistry may use several common materials and manufacturing methods, there should be low cost barrier to entry and it is expected there will be significant cost reduction in volume production down to the goal of $100\/kWh. The developed technology will be especially well suited for low temperature applications such as high-atmosphere, defense, and aerospace which frequently endure extreme temperatures and require high specific energy. Because of the superior performance at low temperatures compared to the incumbent, South 8 Technologies will first focus on developing the technology in these areas. As the technology matures, an eventual move into grid storage and transportation markets will follow, leading to a substantial decrease in emissions and reliance on imported fuels. The underlying fundamental chemistry with these new materials is a relatively new field and may potentially lead to significant advances in next-generation energy storage devices and broader technologies, leading to new industries, job growth and beyond.

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the development of a fluidic platform for selective bacterial and endotoxin removal from blood. This technology can potentially serve as a novel blood cleansing therapeutic for diseases such as sepsis. Sepsis is a life-threatening complication caused by infection. In the U.S., sepsis afflicts over 1.6 million annually and has an associated mortality rate ranging from 25-50%. Realization of this fluidic platform technology will address the broader societal needs of inhibiting sepsis progression and developing more specific and effective therapeutics for the treatment of human disease. Commercialization and implementation of the proposed innovation may reduce the hospital length of stay associated with sepsis, decrease sepsis morbidity and mortality rates, and potentially reduce the annual U.S. expenditure for sepsis. Scientific and technological understanding generated by this work has additional applications for other blood-borne diseases, such as HIV, leukemia, and Lyme disease. Ultimately, this technology will revolutionize life science research through inertial-based fluidic platform use, enabling new discoveries in cell\/particle focusing phenomena and interactions that have profound implications for elucidating inertial focusing mechanisms and for the development of novel platform technologies. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes a novel approach to address the problem of sepsis through the direct removal of pathogens and associated toxins from circulation. Sepsis is the leading cause of death of the critically ill in the United States, costing over $24 Billion in treatment annually. The primary treatment for sepsis is system antibiotic administration, which is failing due to the rise of drug resistance and new, emerging pathogens. The research objectives of this project will result in an easy to use, efficient, and cost-effective fluidic platform for separation and removal of bacteria and associated toxins from circulation. This will facilitate the broad use of inertial-based fluidic platforms as research tools and for clinical applications, such as sepsis. The proposed research will 1) optimize fluidic platform design for clinical application, economical use, and workflow efficiency, 2) demonstrate efficient fluidic platform-mediated bacteria and endotoxin capture, and 3) confirm the biological benefits of the fluidic platform technology using a validated animal model of sepsis. Successful completion of these studies will demonstrate the positive biological consequences of direct pathogen and toxin removal from circulation and establish the commercial viability of the fluidic platform technology.

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop engineered brewer&apos;s yeast to produce hop flavor compounds during beer fermentation, so as to replace the need for agriculturally produced hops. Using agriculturally produced hops as a flavor component poses several challenges: 1) hops farming is natural resource intensive, 2) flavors imparted by hops are inconsistent from batch-to-batch, 3) lengthy agriculture timelines decouple demand from supply, and 4) new flavor varieties are restricted by slow and capital intensive hops breeding programs. This project establishes a product development framework for engineering brewer&apos;s yeast to produce flavor compounds during fermentation that are matched to consumer preferences. The technology developed during this project will allow for sustainable, consistent, on-demand production of hop flavors, and, in addition, may be extended to additional flavors and other fermentable products. This SBIR Phase II project will develop engineered brewer&apos;s yeast for production of flavor compounds that are ordinarily derived from hops. At present, the beer industry relies on agriculturally produced hops to impart organoleptically rich flavors and character to beer. Engineered yeast strains will serve as a drop-in replacement for conventional brewing strains, in that they both ferment beer and produce flavor compounds at concentrations desired in the finished beer. By applying an agile development framework towards yeast strain development, new brewer&apos;s yeast strains will be generated that produce flavor bouquets preferred by brewers and consumers. Genes that encode biosynthetic pathways for production of flavor compounds will be incorporated into brewer&apos;s yeast, and various gene regulatory programs will be tested that give rise to myriad flavor bouquets in finished beer. Strains will be initially evaluated in small-scale micro-aerobic fermentations and analyzed by GC\/MS to screen for relevant flavor compound concentrations. Based on screening results, strains with desired target flavor compound concentrations will be used to produce beer at industrial pilot scale for evaluation by sensory analysis panels as a means of generating consumer feedback. This workflow will be deployed in an iterative fashion to optimize the performance of the hops flavor-producing brewer&apos;s yeast.

An implantable micro-biosensor that reliably detects, monitors, and tracks alcohol consumption allows for more accurate diagnosis so the appropriate treatment solution can be prescribed and tracked. Our system integrates an implantable micro-biosensor with smartphone technology to continuously detect and monitor, collect, transmit, store, and analyze relevant biodata, pushing resulting behavior change instructions to the user. This creates a revolutionary approach to the diagnosis and treatment of alcohol use disorders by reporting outcome data more accurately and reliably than current, self-reporting methods. Our system potentially yields multiple societal benefits, including lower treatment costs and increased treatment accessibility. Additionally, it could reduce both economic and social costs through the identification of people at risk thereby increasing the number of people who seek and receive treatment. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will focus on refining the design and functionalization of an injectable alcohol micro-biosensor, developing a wearable device, and testing the alcohol micro-biosensor in animals. Once fully developed, our system for detecting, monitoring, and treating alcohol use disorders will consist of three components: 1) a multi-plex micro-biosensor, small enough to be directly injected under the skin. The sensor is customizable to continuously monitor and measure alcohol; 2) a wearable sensor device that provides power to the injected micro-biosensor while collecting the measured data to transmit to a nearby smartphone or other data aggregator; and 3) a mobile smartphone application developed by our company that uses evidence-based psychotherapy techniques to encourage behavior modification. The anticipated technical results include an implantable micro-biosensor for the continuous monitoring and measuring of alcohol consumption. Additionally, an unobtrusive wearable device that can power the biosensor and store and transmit the data collected is anticipated. Both of these components will have been tested in animals and be ready to move on to testing in humans.

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project are foundations for an emerging industry: insects in agriculture. Beta Hatch is pioneering the production of new animal feed ingredients, developing technology to mass produce insects, and creating STEM jobs. The proposed work will allow scaling insects as a sustainable protein-rich feed ingredient. With predictable year-round production, this will contribute to a more robust and secure agricultural system. The Beta Hatch insect ranch, which will be designed through integration of the results from this project, is an on-site solution to convert organic by- products into valuable feed ingredients and fertilizer. These ranches are being designed as conversions of underutilized spaces (warehouses and poultry barns), to bring jobs to rural and HUBZone areas. We work closely with farmers, our main customers, to establish the performance and economic value of our products. Insects provide nutrition and make animals healthier. Our frass (insect manure), is an organic fertilizer that stimulates healthy soils, and has no nitrates (no runoff). The proposed work will allow us to establish insects as the world?s most sustainable animal feed ingredient, and to disrupt the $400B animal feed market. This SBIR Phase II project proposes to cost effectively scale insect production for agricultural markets. Of the millions of insect species that exist, only a handful have been successfully reared under controlled conditions and even fewer have been mass produced. And yet insects have the potential to fill essential roles in agricultural supply chains by biodegrading wastes, removing or recycling toxins, and providing nutrition for animals. In order to meet the scale, quality and cost requirements for agricultural markets, significant R&amp;D must solve some core challenges in insect mass production. We propose to integrate biological and engineering approaches to develop novel oviposition substrates, identify and mitigate causes of mortality, design automated and flexible diet handling systems, optimize rearing trays (the basic unit of production), and maximize yields with automated water and diet delivery. The proposed work will cut over 80% of our costs, produce several patents, and inform the design of a scalable insect ranching facility. As a natural part of animal diets, insects are a predictable protein-rich alternative feed ingredient, with year-round controlled production. In Phase 1 of this project, we established an insect breeding program, explored novel inorganic diets, and identified the core production challenges for scaling insects-as-feed. For this NSF SBIR Phase 2 project, we develop solutions that will reduce the cost of production and control the cost of future facilities.

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be observed through a direct reduction in the energy consumption required by large industrial facilities, commercial buildings, campuses, and homes. Due to reduced cooling demands as a result of carefully designed radiative properties, the sustainability of federal and industry facilities will be significantly improved with the installation of passive radiative composite (PRC) roofing material for building energy management. The market demand for cool roofing materials has exceeded $1 Billion, annually, and is expected to grow with increasing need and return on investment. PRC roofing material can expect to compete in a growing industry due to non-trivial improvement over state-of-the-art options in commercial cool roofing products and the economic fabrication method identified in the PRC conceptual design stage. Opportunities extend beyond structural thermal management to a variety of cooling needs including refrigerated transportation and storage. The development of PRC roofing will advance understanding and use of spectrally-selective materials designed for intelligent control of thermal radiation. The proposed project will provide critical design, testing, and experimental validation needed to transition PRC technology into the commercial sector. Designs based on electromagnetic and thermal modeling include composite material options capable of providing passive radiative flux of over 100 Watts per square meter of installed material. This passive cooling advantage, relative to current commercial cool roofing materials, is expected to create significant long-term cost savings and reduction in fossil fuel usage for climate controlled structures. PRC material properties designed to be spectrally selective offer the opportunity for intelligent thermal management through reflection of solar and near-infrared portions of the radiative spectrum, while emitting strongly in the 8-13 micron atmospheric transmission window. A primary objective of the SBIR project is to optimize PRC designs considering full spectrum properties with three criteria in mind: thermal efficiency improvement, durability, and large batch manufacturing economy. Demonstration of PRC-based roofing materials on full-scale test structures will quantify passive cooling power and robustness to weathering, positioning PRC-based roofing for introduction by a commercial manufacturing partner. This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project include development of a commercial proof-of-concept percutaneous directional microwave ablation (MWA) applicator which may provide medical practitioners a new approach for treating cancer. In clinical use, a directional MWA applicator will facilitate both procedural and technical simplification of MWA treatments, saving time and critical resources in hospitals, and ultimately improve quality of, and access to, cancer treatment for a broad range of patients. The research and development proposed in this project will enhance scientific and technological understanding of miniaturized MWA antennas capable of radiating with directional patterns. Specifically, special materials to reduce required antenna dimension and increase efficiency, and advanced antenna designs to maximize the size of directional ablation zones will be studied during this project. Commercial development of the proposed technical advances could expand their use for the treatment of other medical conditions or for applications in other industries such as wireless communications. This STTR Phase I project will contribute to the creation of technology jobs in Kansas, a region where there are few medical or technology companies. This STTR Phase I project proposes to develop a commercial proof-of-concept directional microwave ablation (MWA) applicator. MWA procedures offer cost-effective, minimally-invasive treatment options for localized tumors and other disease. These treatments are especially important to the large population of cancer patients who are poor candidates for surgery or other physically demanding therapies. However, currently available MWA systems employ applicators with omni-directional radiation patterns, which if not placed precisely may damage critical healthy tissues or result in disease recurrence. A directional MWA applicator can facilitate technical and procedural simplifications which to alleviate these current challenges. We will investigate: (1) alternative materials to shrink antenna cross-section and (2) novel antenna geometries to maximize the size of directional microwave ablation zones. We will employ an approach integrating multiphysics computational models, benchtop experimentation in ex vivo tissue, and experiments in animal models in vivo to design, optimize, and validate our device. Our anticipated technical results are the development of a MWA applicator that provides directional control of radiation pattern that can ablate to depths of greater than 30 mm, creating an ablation volume comparable to current clinical non-directional devices.

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer(STTR) project is to develop a bio-based manufacturing process for glucaric acid and its intermediate, glucuronic acid. Microbial fermentation represents an attractive option for production of fuels and valuable chemicals from renewable resources, and glucaric acid can be produced from glucose, a renewable biomass-derived resource. The glucaric acid market was estimated at $550M in 2016, and has a plethora of uses ranging from detergents to food ingredients, corrosion inhibitors, and de-icing applications. The proposed project will engineer improved productivity of the microbe using C5\/C6 sugars, thus accelerating the production of low-cost, high-purity glucaric acid. Achieving these bioprocess improvements will facilitate widespread adoption of bio-based glucaric acid in a variety of markets, broadening opportunity for US products. These applications include coatings, foams and foaming aids, electrolytes, gels, polymers, and polymer additives. This STTR Phase I project proposes to perform multi-omics studies to characterize the physiology of E. coli strains producing glucaric acid via fermentation, and develop strain engineering strategies to enable high yield and productivity. Most fermentation products are highly reduced compared to the starting sugar, and care must be taken to maintain cells in a reduced state, meaning high NADH\/NAD ratio, to drive the NADH-consuming biosynthetic reactions. Products that are derived from sugar oxidation, in contrast, pose a much different challenge, and have been explored to a much lesser extent. Here, additional oxygen is needed to accept the excess electrons generated during glucose oxidation. It is well known that both S. cerevisiae and E. coli, two of the most common organisms for industrial application, are limited in their electron transport chain capacity, resulting in overflow products from high glucose uptake rates. Regardless of the oxygen transfer ability of the fermentation equipment, there is an inherent maximum production rate of these organisms. In this project, the plan is to develop E. coli strains with increased respiration capacity, thus increasing the maximum glucose oxidation rate. Glucaric acid, which can be produced from glucose via 3 enzymatic reaction steps, is an exemplary product.

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project will be the development of a detection assay to reduce the incidence of Vibrio-related infections. Infections from Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Vibrio vulnificus are the leading causes of seafood-borne infections and fatalities, respectively, and stem primarily from raw oysters. Development and implementation of rapid, accurate, inexpensive and easy-to-use testing methods would expand Vibrio data collection and enhance preventive measures by state shellfish labs (monitor harvest areas), and oyster processors and post-harvest processors (quality control at facilities). The assays will be available to users in simple, ready-to-prepare kits. These kits will make it easy for non-specialized personnel to test oyster lots still under refrigeration without disrupting logistics, and help U.S. oyster processors and post-harvest processors improve risk management tools and access export markets with restrictions on Vibrio levels. The tests also will improve environmental risk evaluations for harvest areas by state shellfish labs, FDA, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and other members of the National Shellfish Sanitation Program. The tests will be marketed in the U.S., and other large oyster producing nations. This STTR Phase I project proposes to develop two-phase, thermostable test tube media formulations for the detection and enumeration of pathogenic V. parahaemolyticus, total V. parahaemolyticus, and V. vulnificus in oysters. The goal is to demonstrate a) &gt; 95% sensitivity and specificity of each test with pure cultures and oyster samples; b) 24-hr detection time; c) ease-of-use of the ready-to-prepare kits, based on time, steps, equipment, materials and feedback from industry; and d) low cost. The main technical hurdles are: 1) Increasing formulation volumes for test tube assays since linear increases of agar layer volumes in test tube media formulations could impact Vibrio organism motility, and consequently detection speed and accuracy; and 2) replacing a non-heat stable antibiotic component, Polymixin B of the V. vulnificus test, with a heat stable alternative, like ampicillin or lincomycin, to improve ease-of-use.

The technology would enable: all-natural, shelf stable fruit and vegetable products that retain maximum nutritional value, texture, and taste. With significant percentages of the total US national energy budget used for food-related energy, and high fresh produce loss in the developed countries due to insufficient refrigeration, achieving shelf life extension without cold storage or preservatives could drastically reduce energy costs, increase efficiency, and expand access to nutrition globally. This STTR Phase I project proposes to develop, validate, and build-upon initial research to evaluate the feasibility and scope of a novel food processing technology. Traditional processing methodologies have fundamental drawbacks. High temperature treatments degrade nutritional quality while altering texture and taste of end-products. Freezing negatively affects the reconstitution properties of fruits and vegetables, and requires high energy consumption throughout the food system to maintain the cold chain. HPP (high pressure processing) has limitations on the enzymes it can inactivate, and chemical alterations from high pressure treatment negatively affects texture and taste. This research proposal will use validation studies to evaluate the feasibility and applicability of the novel processing technique to a variety of fruits and vegetables. Successful experimentation will prove that the application of dense phase gas at low temperatures can overcome the aforementioned drawbacks, achieving enzymatic inactivation, destruction of the spores, improved reconstitution properties, lower energy requirements, and minimal deterioration of taste, texture, and nutritional quality. Such a result would actuate follow-on development work to validate that, at commercial scale, the new process technology improves upon the operational costs of traditional methodologies.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will assess the commercial viability of using new non-precious metal catalysts to produce hydrogen by splitting water. Electrolyzers made with these new catalysts have the potential to deliver higher efficiencies and lower capital costs than currently available systems. The market for hydrogen today is $115 billion per year. Currently, hydrogen is primarily produced via steam reformation of methane. Hydrogen production via steam reformation emits millions of tons of CO2 into the atmosphere annually. There is broad agreement that water electrolysis can play a significant role in future hydrogen production if cost reductions can be realized. In addition, hydrogen has the potential to store energy produced by renewable energy systems like solar and wind and make it available on demand. The initial market entry point for these new electrolyzers is to supply hydrogen for fuel cell powered forklifts used in material handling. A life cycle cost analysis by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) has shown that the total life cycle costs of hydrogen fuel cell forklifts are 10% cheaper than those using lead acid batteries. The intellectual merit of this project is focused on the ability of new earth-abundant non-precious metal catalysts for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) to dramatically lower costs while improving efficiency in water splitting. The HER electrocatalyst is composed of hyper-thin FeS2 nano-discs and the OER electrocatalyst is nanoamorphous Ni0.8:Fe0.2 oxide. The preferred operating pH for the catalysts are different (pH 7 for the hyper-thin FeS2 nano-discs and pH 14 for the nanoamorphous Ni0.8:Fe0.2 oxide). Preliminary data shows that these two catalysts with the dual-pH membrane can effectively split water with a total overpotential of only 300 mV (1.53 V in a two electrode configuration). This is more than 50 mV lower than the best-known precious metal catalysts, Pt and IrOx, used in current commercial electrolyzers. The project will continue the optimization of these catalysts in the dual-pH electrolyzer stack and also determine if stability and lifetime meet commercial requirements This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "abstract": "This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase I project aims at developing a roll-to-roll, solid-state, continuous process for manufacturing nanocellular thermoplastic films with open (interconnected) or closed (not interconnected) cells of the order 10-100 nm and as much as 50% porosity. The initial application of this proposed project is an improved Lithium-ion battery separator comprising a nanoporous polyetherimide (PEI) film of 10-25-micron thickness with uniformly distributed interconnected 10-50 nm size cells. The nanoporous PEI separator, which has significantly higher heat resistance than current polyolefin-based separators, addresses a very urgent safety issue, i.e., batteries exploding and causing fire due to thermal instability of the separator. Moreover, compared to the current multi-step process for fabricating battery separators, this continuous process will have higher productivity thereby increasing the nation&apos;s global competitiveness in battery manufacturing. The total addressable global market for separators used in both primary (single-use) and secondary (rechargeable) lithium batteries is projected to be $1.65 billion by 2020 growing at 4.7%. This innovative research project will contribute to new knowledge in the areas of gas diffusion and cell nucleation in thermoplastic polymeric films and enable development, characterization and application of a whole new class of solid-state nanocellular polymer films. The intellectual merit of this project resides in the development of a manufacturing process that brings together interdisciplinary knowledge to synthesize and characterize nanostructures under various process conditions. This new knowledge will advance the field of nanomanufacturing and will be used to optimize processes towards commercialization targets. There are two technical challenges: (i) the dynamic seal concept, which has been proven in a 250-micron thick polymer film but not for a film 10-20 times lower in thickness; and (ii) maintaining enough gas concentration during the cell nucleation and growth to create nano-sized cells. The goals of this project are to: (a) establish the feasibility of a roll-to-roll process operating at a minimum speed of 1 meter\/minute to produce nanocellular thermoplastic films and (b) develop a 100-mm wide, 10-25 micron thick nanoporous polyetherimide (PEI) film having the desired properties and nanostructure profile for a Li-ion battery separator application. These two goals will be achieved by implementing the dynamic seal technology to process a 100-mm wide film on a continuous basis and immediately heating the film to create nanocells. This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project is the advancement of improved lithium ion batteries. The project will evaluate new battery chemistry enabling more rapid charging rates then currently available in the worldwide energy storage marketplace. Such high power density batteries would cater to a major emerging battery segment where current lithium ion battery technologies fall dramatically short. Successful development of this innovation will provide benefits to both current and future applications. Clearly, large scale deployment of a markedly superior energy storage device will have significant societal benefits by accelerating the move away from fossil fuel in many applications and products. For instance, a viable regenerative braking energy storage technology based on the proposed technology would result in a tremendous reduction in electricity used by subway trains, with a concomitant reduction of CO2 emissions. This STTR Phase I project proposes to address the core of the microstructure - performance relations in energy storing materials, answering a series of fundamental questions regarding how a charge carrier is reversibly or irreversibly stored at high rates in manganese oxide - carbon nanocomposite anodes. In conventional LIBs, it is the graphite-based anode that limits charging rates, with catastrophic lithium metal plating and dendrite growth occurring at increased currents. It is expected that many of the existing &quot;Graphite - Inherited&quot; paradigms regarding fast rate in anodes would be done away with, or substantially redefined with the proposed approach for designing high power lithium ion batteries based on an inexpensive hemp-derived carbon nanosheets and nanostructured manganese oxide anodes. A much clearer understanding of the synthesis - structure - property relations in such nanocomposites will have wide-reaching scientific and technological implications. Research and development activities will focus on structural optimization and manufacturing scalability along with fabrication and testing of near-commercial pouch cell form factors in order to demonstrate device-level performance and commercial viability of the proposed technology.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project advances a cost-effective and scalable direct recycling method for producing battery-grade cathode materials from end-of-life (EOL) lithium-ion batteries. The commercialization of the proposed direct lithium-ion battery recycling technology will lower the energy consumption and emissions associated with battery production, reduce demand for raw battery materials and decrease lithium-ion battery manufacturing cost. Using directly recycled materials instead of raw battery materials will diminish or even avoid the negative environmental impacts from mining and processing ores and from disposal of hazardous waste. Reducing battery cost will facilitate the implementation of more efficient electrified vehicles, thus reducing petroleum demand and vehicle emissions. Finally, research on the end-of-life lithium-ion battery cathode, on the direct recycling process and on the recycled materials will advance the understanding of intercalation chemistry in nonaqueous and aqueous media and of electrode degradation during electrochemical cycling. The intellectual merit of this project is to advance the direct recycling technology through the design and demonstration of a scalable electrochemical flow system capable of non-destructive relithiation and the optimization of post treatment operation for the recovered materials. The electrochemical flow system is capable of restoring the lost lithium in the EOL cathode material at any state of charge (SOC) and can be scaled to a commercially viable size. The cathode materials recovered in the proposed direct recycling process retain the same structure and morphology and exhibit equivalent electrochemical performance compared to the commercial virgin cathode materials. The recovery of high-value cathode materials substantially improves the profitability of lithium-ion battery recycling and is a key element of the business plan.

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project is to develop an external stent that can improve the quality and length of life for dialysis patients. Dialysis is the primary lifeline for End-Stage Renal Disease patients. Unfortunately, our current standard of care, which provides no additional support or treatment to the artery-vein connections surgically created in the arm to initiate dialysis (i.e. access sites), results in 40-60% failure rates within the first year. Consequences of these failures are dire: significant pain, suffering, and death for dialysis patients, hospital readmission penalties, and more than $1B in direct costs to Medicare. An external stent that wraps around the vein-artery\/-graft junction of dialysis patients at the time of access site creation surgery has been developed to reduce these failures in a preventative fashion. In order to maximize the impact that it can have on the lives of dialysis patients by providing favorable flow conditions (i.e. hemodynamics) through the access site, it is imperative to first optimize device design on the bench with the aid of computational modeling. Findings from this grant will further scientific understanding of external supports and the role that hemodynamics play in access site failures. This STTR Phase I project proposes to create a computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model that successfully predicts flow and deformation conditions at the access site in the presence or absence of an external stent, and to use this model to identify external stent design parameters that promote the most favorable hemodynamic environment for preventing access site failures. First, a 3D printing method of manufacture will be optimized to enable the fabrication of external stents in a highly-repeatable manner conducive to large-scale, FDA-compliant production. A CFD model will be created from empirical results in which surgically-constructed anastomoses (e.g. vein-graft junctions) are exposed to arteriovenous-mimetic pressure and flow conditions in the absence or presence of external stent designs. Empirical ex vivo data to validate the CFD model simulation results will be collected from quantitative measurements of dynamic deformation (e.g. magnitude of expansion) and flow patterns (i.e. velocity fields) in the presence or absence of various external stent designs via 4D flow MRI, which provides spatial and temporal information on 3D flow over the entire anastomosis. This work should result in the identification of a few designs that assert hemodynamic effects conducive to reducing neointimal hyperplasia, the primary culprit of access site failures.

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project is the reduction of significant disease flare-ups in patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), increase in patient quality-of-life, and a reduction of expensive and unnecessary healthcare utilization. Current at-home care support for COPD patients is often completely missing or consists of action plans that fail to provide effective, individualized care. The alternative solution under development in this project is an easy-to use, personalized mobile application that catches disease degeneration early, tracks patient health history, and provides decision support to guide patients to the right medical care at the right time. COPD is one of the leading chronic conditions driving potentially avoidable hospital admissions. Pairing a mobile health management app with a smart triage system that provides instant healthcare guidance has the potential to dramatically reduce unnecessary COPD hospitalization and provide long-term maintenance treatment of COPD symptoms. Moreover, an easily accessible, highly accurate, convenient solution can empower patients to make better health decisions early. This STTR Phase I project proposes to demonstrate positive impact and adoption of a mobile triage application for COPD patients. To date, a set of triage algorithms has been built and validated on simulated patient cases. The algorithms exhibited performance that is comparable to or better than a panel of board-certified pulmonologists. The next vital step is to establish the technical feasibility of a packaged, stand-alone mobile application. This research will focus on developing a fully featured prototype that is optimized for adoption, retention, and efficacy. A mix of user feedback and rigorous usage analysis collected through human testing will provide necessary insights on barriers to use, missing functionality, and consumer value. Standardized markers of health safety, symptom escalations, and patient quality-of-life will be used as metrics of product performance. Moreover, all data and conclusions will be subjected to peer review through publication and public presentations. As an additional objective, the accuracy of the algorithmic triage recommendations will be tested on real patient cases to further validate their accuracy and effectiveness. The anticipated result of the phase I procedure is demonstration that the app is safe (objective 1), operationally sound and optimal (phase 2), and valuable to consumers (objective 3).

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this project includes increased range, increased efficiency, and decreased size of wireless charging systems, which will provide value to consumer devices (e.g., mobile phones and tablets), transportation, and medical industries. In consumer devices, improved and widely adopted wireless power transfer can lead to more rugged designs of the devices by eliminating charging ports, which are a common mode of device failure. Widely adopted wireless charging can improve convenience for consumers, and, with a unified charging solution across a number of devices, eliminate the need for dedicated, device-specific chargers. Increased charging range will increase the number of use cases in all three industries, leading to greater commercial opportunities for this this technology and wireless power transfer in general. In transportation, high-efficiency wireless charging allows for fast charging that is adaptable to varying vehicle heights, which makes electric vehicles more convenient, increases their rate of adoption, and allows charging that is integrated into infrastructure. Increased efficiency reduces the energy costs associated with charging across all three industries. Furthermore, this project will enhance the scientific understanding of the power handling capabilities of the multilayer self-resonant structure, and the resonant frequencies achievable with various manufacturing techniques. This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project addresses the technical challenges keeping a new wireless power transfer coil technology, called the multilayer self-resonant structure (MSRS), from the market. In order to commercialize the MSRS, the technology must advance beyond a proof-of-concept, and interface with commercial wireless power transfer systems, specifically those that adhere to existing device standards. The technical hurdles that need to be addressed include 1) reducing the resonant frequency to meet current standards, 2) understanding the power handling limits, and 3) developing electronic interfaces. These challenges will be overcome by, respectively, 1) building on existing manufacturing techniques used to handle thin layers of material in other industries and adapting them to develop a scalable manufacturing approach to construct MSRSs with resonant frequencies in the range needed. 2) Analyzing, measuring, and modeling the power handling capabilities of the MSRS. Finally, 3) Developing impedance matching circuitry required to interface the MSRS with commercial systems. Successful completion of these task will results in a low cost, high-Q wireless power transfer coil, which can be integrated into commercial systems to increase the capable range, efficiency, and power handling of wireless charging.

This project also pursues a technique for accelerating the process of improving non-thermal plasma performance, upon the completion of which new and improved non-thermal plasma devices can be developed for applications such as this more rapidly than is possible now. Completion of the project will enable the development of lower-cost protective technologies for maintaining livestock health, making such technologies economically accessible to a larger segment of food protein producers, ultimately lowering food costs and increasing domestic food security. This STTR Phase I project proposes to experimentally demonstrate and evaluate the effectiveness of a non-thermal plasma (NTP) as a means of preventing disease-carrying particles in outside air from infecting livestock housed in animal confinement buildings. NTPs are stable electrical discharges that simultaneously contribute to the removal of airborne particles while also subjecting them to chemical attack capable of killing harmful viruses. While NTPs have been demonstrated for disinfection of fixed surfaces, and to a lesser degree for the destruction of chemical contaminants or biological pathogens in air, the intellectual merit of this project stems from its evaluation of trace gases commonly present in the air around livestock, ammonia and hydrogen sulfide, and their potential to both enhance and diminish the performance of NTPs used in farm environments. Additionally, this project will identify non-biological tracers suitable for use in NTP optimization testing which will accelerate the development of improved designs. Two separate lab-scale NTP reactors will be used in the execution of the project. This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this project is an innovative new capacitor technology based on kilohertz high-frequency supercapacitor, called AC-Supercap, aiming to replace conventional aluminum electrolytic capacitors (AECs) for a vast range of electronic and power systems. Capacitors are an essential component used in electronic devices, in power supplies driving electrical machines, appliances and instruments, as well as in power conversion and conditioning systems used for renewable energy generation. In the consumer electronics sector, miniaturization and low-profile or even flexible packaging, and higher power efficiency are some of the key demands. In the power system and other power-demanding industry sectors, large capacitance, large ripple current absorption, and high temperature rating are the key requirements. With the emergence of distributed wireless sensors and Internet of Things (IoT), pulse energy storage and generation will be necessary as well. AC-Supercap, with its much better performance than current solutions, is anticipated to better serve the needs of broad range of customers. Upon the success of this technology, there will also be tremendous impact on the local ecosystem and regional community of West Texas. This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will investigate the feasibility of producing AC-Supercap as high-performance alternating current (AC) filtering capacitors for power modules, on-board application, or as compact and efficient pulse power storage. Conventional AECs, limited by their low capacitance density, bulky size, poor lifetime, large equivalent series resistance, and polarity sensitivity cannot meet technical needs well. To achieve AC-Supercaps with both large capacitance density and high-frequency response, two contradictory requirements, and nanostructured electrode engineering will be investigated. To produce a compact capacitor with a large voltage rating and capacitance, multicell integration will be optimally designed and demonstrated, which is crucial considering the intrinsic low voltage rating of a single cell. The proposed innovative solutions to these technical challenges will de-risk the AC-Supercap product prototyping in the following project phases to make ready the technology for commercialization. These research activities will advance the scientific understanding and technological development of nanostructured electrode process and property control, multicell integration design, and particularly AC-Supercap technology.

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project is to improve outcomes and decrease costs in the mental health space by engaging patients starting with their first therapy session through objective progress reporting and post-session motivation. Patients and clinicians alike will be able to track and assess treatment progress through self-reported and physiological measures. This innovation builds upon the strong academic, government, and industry partnerships that will advance research and innovation in the field of biotechnology. By demonstrating improved outcomes and decreased costs associated with the utilization of technology, this will pave the way for insurance reimbursement (using existing CPT codes) to accelerate market adoption. Additionally, as education of patients and the public improves regarding mental health and PTSD in particular, the negative stigma surrounding these conditions will decrease and more people in need will seek help rather than resorting to unhealthy behavior or even suicide. This STTR Phase I project proposes to represent an innovative approach that provides easy to interpret results tailored to mental health providers, patients, and other non-technical users. Current mental health treatment and assessment has lacked qualitative, scientifically-based measurement. The need for a scientific measurement is evident, as about 8 percent of all adults - 1 of 13 people in this country will develop PTSD during their lifetime. Currently, 60% of adults diagnosed with a mental illness don&apos;t receive mental health treatment; using proven science and physiologic measurements as the foundation for improving treatment and monitoring progress for PTSD can help to alleviate some of the stigma surrounding mental illnesses. This project aims to demonstrate how implementing a web-based platform can improve PTSD treatment by providing physiologically relevant feedback to the patient and by providing a tool for the clinician to tailor the therapy to the individual patient. Patients will have their subjective measures and physiological data visualized throughout treatment on a software platform, with progress being tracked through validated assessment scales. Patients will be compared to others in treatment as usual. Results should yield improved quality of life and decrease long term healthcare costs for those that use the platform.

        "abstract": "This STTR Phase 1 project seeks to develop an automated system that would significantly increase the speed and accuracy of biopsy assessments at the point of care. The proposed technology eliminates extensive manual tissue processing steps and generates digital images of fresh biopsies that look just like standard pathology slides. The imaging can be performed in seconds, thus improving the efficiency of biopsy assessments at the point of care. Rapid, whole fresh biopsy imaging also improves evaluation accuracy while maximally preserving tissue for further testing and facilitating remote pathology consultation. With over five million patients in the United States undergoing biopsy procedures each year, and one in five of those patients returning for repeat procedures due to inaccuracies in biopsy assessments, an increase in accuracy and procedure speed could have a profound impact. This could lead to decreases in patient procedure time and decreases in repeat procedure rates, preventing unnecessary, painful, and invasive repeat biopsy procedures. With an estimated 1.6 billion USD spend on repeat procedures per year, this would also represent a significant decrease in financial burden on patients. In addition, due to the decrease in time per procedure, this could increase procedure throughput for hospitals, thus increasing hospital revenue potential. Finally, by producing remotely viewable images, this system could be utilized in a remote pathology setting at underserved communities within the US. This STTR Phase I project seeks to develop an automated sample processing and tissue pathology imaging system that delivers biopsy-to-image in a completely automated manner on fully-intact fresh tissues within five minutes of tissue removal. Through integration with the previously developed Video-Rate Structured Illumination Microscopy (VR-SIM) system as the integrated optical sectioning modality, and using novel fluorescence dye combinations that recapitulate gold-standard histology, the throughput, efficiency, and accuracy of biopsy evaluation can be improved while maximally preserving tissue for downstream processing and readily facilitating telepathology consultation. Preliminary work in multiple fresh tissue preparations, including core-needle biopsies and whole surgical resections, indicates that the technology and method can deliver high image quality and diagnostic accuracy in short, clinically-relevant timeframes. A prototype of an automated, disposable cartridge system for biopsy staining and imaging for effortless integration with VR-SIM imaging will be developed. Image quality will be optimized at the highest optical sectioning power to be equivalent to physically-sectioned tissues, using polarization-gated VR-SIM and novel immersion media. ADPL workflow testing, validation of diagnostic image quality, and verification of compatibility with downstream analysis in human biopsy samples will be completed.

        "abstract": "The broader impact \/ commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to enable electrification of remote oil &amp; gas processes to reduce methane emissions, improve on-site safety, and provide leak-detection and monitoring capabilities. This will be achieved by developing a robust, efficient, small-scale power generator capable of converting on-site fuel to electricity. Beyond the entry opportunity in the oil &amp; gas sector, this technology has other applications in large markets such as residential and commercial power generation and heating, transportation, and military. For example, our proposed generators would allow consumers in moderate\/cold climates to efficiently match their time-dependent heating and electrical demands using natural gas (accessible to 70 million households). For a typical household in those regions, we estimate a 45% reduction in primary energy use and CO2 emissions by deploying our generators. The energy reduction translates to an annual savings of about $650 per household. Widespread deployment of our technology would grow the domestic natural gas economy, strengthen the US technological lead in semiconductor manufacturing, and facilitate renewables by providing a dispatchable supply.? The proposed project will investigate the fundamental heat-to-electric conversion process and address key issues around the stability and robustness of the technology, through a synergistic effort to develop generators capable of high performance and a manufacturing process to reduce cost. The project will focus on device optimization and durability, and process repeatability. This involves the fabrication and integration of multiple frequency-selective components including a thermal emitter, optical filter, photovoltaic cell, and back surface reflector. Each component, as well as the integrated system, will undergo rigorous thermal testing to prove both resistance to elevated temperatures and temperature swings. Additionally, novel manufacturing techniques will be developed to enable cost-competitive devices relative to conventional generators. If the technical objectives are met, this project will demonstrate record-breaking performance for thermophotovoltaics and accelerate the commercialization of thermophotovoltaic devices in many different markets.?

However, a more immediate work product from this effort is a powerful fully-digital mmWave software defined radio (SDR) platform that will be made available to academic researchers at very affordable rates; this will spur further research and make mmWave testbed experimentation within the reach of lightly-funded academic research groups. The ambitious goal of making this transformative technology the reference design of future mmWave radios represents a massive commercial opportunity which is not limited to the cellular ecosystem (base station, tablets and smartphones), but rather extends to new connected players such as cars, drones, virtual reality (VR) headsets and beyond. This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project focuses on the development of millimeter-wave (mmWave) radio technologies for next generation wireless systems. The mmWave frequencies of above 28 GHz are necessary to alleviate the spectrum crunch in the traditional cellular bands, and to make ultra-fast 5th Generation (5G) cellular a reality. However, the uniquely challenging propagation characteristics at these frequencies necessitates the use of transceivers that not only operate over low power budgets, but also deliver the robustness that the cellular ecosystem demands. While existing transceivers allow the radio to look (i.e., transmit or receive) in only one direction or a small number of directions at a time, the proposed transceiver design allows the radio to look in all directions simultaneously. While seemingly simple, this unique ability - combined with a top-down implementation ? will provide enormous benefits to cellular systems at reasonable power budgets. The proposed technology forms the key technological bridge between the theoretical promise of mmWave and actually achieving it in the real world.

        "abstract": "To address the Armys need for a novel approach that enables pump combiners with improved coupling efficiency for high-power fiber laser systems, Hedgefog Research Inc. (HFR) proposes to develop a new Fiber Laser with Enhanced Coupling (FLEC) that minimizes excess heat generation in fiber lasers via efficient mode scrambling of the pump light in the cladding of the active fiber. Specifically, we will develop a fiber engineering technology greatly enhancing mode mixing\/scrambling in the active fiber, that can be applied to existing third-party fiber laser systems with minimal re-engineering. In Phase I, HFR will demonstrate the feasibility of FLEC by performing experimental proof-of-principle demonstration of the technology to reach TRL 4. A full integration plan for Phase II development will be proposed by the end of Phase I. In Phase II, HFR will enhance and optimize the technology to meet the Army requirements and reach TRL-6."

        "abstract": "This Phase IIA proposal is in response to the DOE topic 14a request for breakthrough membrane technology that reduces the energy required to separate gases. In this work we are addressing O2 separation. There is a need for lower capital cost, and lower energy consumption in producing high purity oxygen for steel production, chemical processing, medical oxygen, and burning coal for higher efficiency of combustion. The latter will enable less and higher purity CO2 from coal plants, so CO2 can be sequestered more economically. What was done in Phase II Our breakthrough technology is the development of porous inorganic supports with less than 26 nm surface roughness this enables cost-effective deposition of membranes that are only 50-200 nanometer (nm) thick. Present day state-of the-art oxygen membranes are 30-50 micron (\u03bcm) thick deposited on micron surface rough extruded inorganic porous supports. We have developed 50-200 nm thick composite membranes that can separate high purity oxygen at temperatures as low as 300-500\u00b0C verses state-of-the-art membranes that require operation at 800oC. During the Phase II we optimized our nano membrane on ceramic supports, improved the membrane fabrication process reducing the thickness to "

        "abstract": "Next generation light sources, diffraction-limited storage rings, and high repetition rate free electron lasers will have significantly increased the average brightness of the generated X-ray beams. These machines will require X-ray refractive optics with precise dimensional control and smooth surfaces that are capable of handling large heat loads and preservation of the x-ray beam quality. How the problem is being addressed: In this project we will machine refractive lenses out of single crystal diamonds by femtosecond laser pulses. The key advantage of this approach is in the short duration of the laser pulse. Femtosecond pulses only ablate the material and do not lead to thermal fatigue, subsequent crystalline defect formation, and reduction in the quality of X-ray optical properties. With the choice of single crystal diamond for the lens, the scattering on grain boundaries, defects and voids associated with polycrystalline materials currently used will be eliminated and the coherence of the X-rays will be preserved. What was done in Phase I: We fabricated a set of diamond X-ray lenses by fs-laser cutting of various grades of single crystal diamonds. We performed white beam topography to determine which grades of diamond are acceptable for x-ray optics and what damage the fs laser cutting induced on the bulk material. We demonstrated a successful test of lens operation in an x-ray source reimaging configuration at the Advanced Photon Source (APS). We also performed an experiment with a stack of three lenses (compound refractive lens) focusing an undulator source at APS into a ~ 50 x 20 micron spot that approach commercial beryllium lens performance. Finally, we performed diamond slurry polishing of the lens surface. What was done in Phase II: In Phase II we built a custom fs-laser cutter system for complex shapes ablation on diamond surfaces. We developed a post-ablation polishing procedure which produces uniform polishing of the full lens surface. A large number of lenses had been tested at Advanced Photon Source (APS) of Argonne National Laboratory. These tests determined that there is a correlated shape error on the order of 1-3 microns. What will be done in Phase IIA: In Phase II we will adjust manufacturing process \u2013 both ablation and polishing to decrease the shape error to below 1 micron per APS specs. These lenses will be packaged in stainless steel or copper housing for the beamline \u2013 ready compound refractive lens. Applications and benefits: The technology developed here is required to utilize X-ray beams at fourth generation light sources to maximum potential. Diamond is virtually the only material that can withstand the heat load of the next generation light sources. If an inexpensive manufacturing method is established, diamond refractive optics would supersede the current alternative, which is based on beryllium and has safety concerns as well as a lower performance."

        "abstract": "Alphacore intends to submit a proposal for a Sequential Phase IIA grant in January 2018. Thus far in Phase II Alphacore has developed an initial prototype of a radiation-hardened 10,000-pixel camera with custom- designed 10,000-frames-per-second (10kpfs) capable image sensor IC, camera control PCB with FPGA and interface to a PC, and an enclosure allowing different lens options. Most of Alphacore&apos;s engineering hours have focused on the design of an optimized, 1-megapixel, 10kfps, radiation-hardened CMOS image sensor. This image sensor, in addition to being radiation hard, is the fastest megapixel-class image sensor with continuous video output ever built, to the best of our knowledge. Thus, it has tremendous potential value for scientific, medical, military and entertainment industries. One of the parameters that speaks to the complexity of this chip is the fact that it has four thousand 12-bit, 3MSPS ADCs. These relatively high-speed SAR ADCs have very specific pitch-matched layouts, i.e. they are 10um wide and 3mm long. Alphacore\u2019s sensor has ultra-sensitive, radiation-hardened pinned photodiode pixels. At this point, the SPICE model for the full chip architecture is functional and transistor-level designs have been completed for all the circuit blocks. First version of the physical layout design has been completed for the full image sensor. The extracted netlist from the layout is not fully functional for the first layout version as of today and we are debugging it. We believe that the tapeout of this full-reticle-sized (22mm x 27mm) image sensor will take place in January 2018 and this means that it can be tested in April - May 2018."

        "abstract": "Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is one of the primary tools for biological and materials characterization; however, there is an overarching need to push TEM temporal resolution into a ps-range to study physical processes on their fundamental spatial and temporal scales. With state-of-the-art TEM, however, it is not possible to capture a single image with a temporal resolution better than 10 ns due to the limits set by space charge effects in the electron column.\nTechnical Approach To address this limitation, UCLA and RadiaBeam Technologies are developing a single shot picosecond time resolved transmission electron microscope (SPTEM) with 10 ps temporal and 10 nm spatial resolution based on the use of MeV beams from an RF photoinjector to improve TEM temporal resolution by three orders of magnitude. Key elements include the use of RF cavity linearizer, and an ultra-compact optical column based on strong permanent magnet quadrupoles (PMQs) to avoid the large costs and complexities associated with bulky relativistic electron lenses. Phase II Accomplishments In Phase II, we have developed and commissioned the basic SPTEM system elements, including linearizer and PMQ optics. The highlights of previous work are: the first demonstration of single-shot images with ps-long MeV electron beams; and more recently, the demonstration of \u00d7 900 magnification using a two-stage permanent magnet quadrupole lens system. Phase IIa Work Plans In Phase IIa, we will build on the results obtained during Phase II to improve on the performances on the first prototype single shot picosecond TEM based on the existing infrastructure at the UCLA Pegasus laboratory. In particular we plan to improve on the electron beam stability, implement a flexible optical system that would allow for diffraction mode and adjustable magnification. We will also develop a new burst operating mode where multiple images of a process, \u2018before\u2019 and \u2018after\u2019, could be captured. The final goal of the project will be to test the instrument capabilities by performing a time-resolved study of motion of defects in a material. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits There are many exciting scientific challenges and commercial opportunities awaiting novel tools possessing very high combined spatial and temporal resolution, such as the device proposed herein. These include conformational changes in protein, interface dynamics in battery and fuel cells, and phase transition and microstructure development in materials. The device not only would enable further breakthroughs in the understanding of ultrafast phenomena but will also present RadiaBeam with a possibility to enter a lucrative microscopy and metrology instrumentation market."

        "abstract": "The capabilities of modern x-ray light sources have opened up new areas of research in the study of in-situ fast irreversible processes. Irreversible processes or \u201csingle shot\u201d experiments are challenging since they require detectors that can obtain a succession of x-ray images within the time frame of the process in question. This requires high sensitivity, wide dynamic range x-ray detection at frame rates approaching the bunch repetition rates of modern light sources. Today, the capability to do such research is limited by the current state of detector technology. Statement of how this problem is being addressed A novel fast framing hybridized x-ray imaging detector has been demonstrated called the Keck-PAD. The laboratory prototype Keck-PAD has been shown to be capable of acquiring up to 12 successive x-ray images at frame rates of ~7 MHz with single x-ray (e.g., @10keV) sensitivity and with a dynamic range exceeding\n103 x-rays\/pixel\/frame. These specifications provide the performance needed to study in-situ fast irreversible processes. The proposed program will transition this technology from the laboratory into a commercial instrument. What was done in Phase I and II? The Phase I effort demonstrated the feasibility of developing a Keck-PAD architecture to meet immediate and future detector needs for emerging applications. In Phase II the technology to enable four side tileable detection elements was developed and an engineering prototype was built with rudimentary software control. What is planned for the Phase IIa project? In Phase IIa, the engineering prototype detector built in Phase II will be operationally tested and then performance tested at a synchrotron facility. In parallel, an industry standard user interface will be developed and incorporated in to a beta prototype to support further testing at a partner synchrotron facility. Based on experiences learned from the prototype detectors a pre-commercial release device will be designed incorporating all user feedback and necessary system modifications. Commercial Applications and Other Benefit The commercialization of the Keck-PAD will provide researchers with unprecedented capabilities not available today in x-ray detectors. The ability of acquiring x-ray data in the MHz regime through direct x- ray detection would allow users to extract more time resolved data from a single-shot or irreversible-process experiment with high accuracy. These advancements will help overcome the limitations which in many cases currently hinder the science yielded from the study of fast irreversible processes."

        "abstract": "While modern transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is an incredibly powerful tool for nanoscience and biology, in terms of information theory it is extremely inefficient; the great majority of the information acquired in TEM consists of noise and redundant and irrelevant information. The effort to acquire this information costs time and can tax the bandwidth of even the best modern electronics, all the while bombarding the sample with destructive radiation and still missing the inherently high-speed fundamental behavior of the bio- and nano-systems under study. How the Problem is Being Addressed: Compressive sensing, a fast-growing field that applies data compression theory to the acquisition of data rather than just the storage and transmission of data, can solve the problem by operating the hardware such that the redundant information is never acquired in the first place. This project uses IDES&apos; unique programmable high-speed deflector technology to implement data compression in the time domain, effectively improving continuous-acquisition camera frame rates by factors of 100 or more. Combining this with high-dimensional acquisition modes including spectrum imaging, scanning diffraction, and time resolution should make it possible to acquire vast information-rich high-resolution data sets even on radiation-sensitive materials. Phase I\/II Accomplishments: After an extensive theoretical\/computational Phase I study to develop algorithms and identify the best path forward, Phase II saw the development and first commercial introduction of a compressive TEM video product capable of 100-fold frame rate improvements. Two beta units are already functioning in customers&apos; facilities, and journal articles are in preparation. A post- beta system is slated for release at the end of Phase II. Phase IIA Goals: Complete the development of data analysis algorithms and user-friendly software, and introduce a pre-sample beam blanker that coordinates with the compressive video system for precise timing and dose control. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: Compressive sensing greatly widens information bottlenecks and enhances throughput, making feasible many studies that in the past would have required far too much time and electron dose. Especially given the importance of emerging bio\/nano hybrid technologies for advanced energy applications, these past limitations are a serious problem across a vast range of applications."

        "abstract": "Advanced engineering materials are sought for use in nuclear reactors to help deploy affordable and domestic energy sources. Improved design and fabrication methods are needed to reduce cost and allow joining of nuclear-grade SiC-SiC composites for use in gas-cooled and liquid fluoride salt-cooled reactors at high temperatures. Limitations of the existing nuclear grade SiC composites as applied to high- performance nuclear systems include difficulty joining complex geometries and instability of those joints under irradiation, poor initial thermal conductivity and significant conductivity degradation after irradiation, matrix microcracking, and difficulty in producing complex shaped components at low cost.\nGeneral Statement of How This Problem Is Being Addressed.The proposed SiC\/SiC composite utilizes a low-cost approach incorporating a combination of SiC nanoparticles with TiC and Y2O3 to enhance joint strength, thermal conductivity, and radiation resistance. During processing, the nanoparticles are infiltrated into a SiC fiber preform, decreasing porosity and increasing conductivity. The fabrication process, consisting of a combination of nanoinfiltration and transient eutectic-phase and chemical vapor infiltration, directly addresses the requirement for low-cost manufacturing, by allowing full net shapes and the capability to be joined.What was done in Phase II?During Phase II, the best fabrication method for creating SiC composites for use in nuclear reactors was developed. These materials and methods resulted in a joined composite material with higher thermal conductivity than currently reported and high mechanical strength and bonding properties. Flat samples were joined and machined into hourglass specimens to be irradiated and tested at an outside laboratory. Simulations were conducted, and the prototype was evaluated for scalability.What is Planned for the Phase II Project?Based on research and results from Phases I and II, the fabrication method will be optimized and repeatability established. Samples will be irradiated and tested at a partner laboratory. Nuclear tie-rods or other complex shaped and joined parts selected by the project team will be created using the method developed, and tested for irradiation stability. The manufacturing methods will be refined and prototype upscaling will be considered.Commercial Applications and Other Benefits.The proposed technology will result in a high-strength, radiation- and temperature-resistant SiC composite able to be joined, and produced at low cost. It will have commercial applications in areas such as structural components and blanket structures for nuclear power plants and fuel cladding (in particular, Generation IV gas-cooled and liquid fluoride salt-cooled reactors), aerospace, and other industries. Finally, a large commercial market is envisioned in aerospace rocket and engine components, which require high-strength, high-temperature, and lightweight materials."

        "abstract": "In the modern technological era, many breakthroughs rely on understanding how advanced nanoscopic materials or devices operate at rates approaching or exceeding 1 GHz. This requires adequate instrumentation. At the moment, none of electron- or photon-based time-resolved techniques\/tools is able to provide GHz-scale sampling rates. Factors limiting sampling rates at light sources are complex, and even if they are solved, limited beam time allocations will still limit the availability of x-ray GHz methods. In ultrafast transmission electron microscopy (UTEM), which makes use of a stroboscopic laser-based pump-probe method in which the data are repeatedly collected over extended periods of time, the thermal load from the pump laser must be handled so that the process under study stays reversible. As a result, GHz sampling is not attainable, and the maximum sampling rate is sub- GHz. How the problem is being addressed: A novel laser-free time-resolved GHz stroboscopic concept for TEM would resolve sub-nanosecond processes in advanced magnetic, electronic, ionic and photonic materials\/devices, driven by electromagnetic stimuli, under actual operation conditions. In the family of time-resolved electron probe methods, such a laser-free GHz stroboscopic concept would fulfill a different temporal landscape that is complementary to the existing commercial solutions. What was done in Phase II: In Phase II, we completed the fabrication of the first prototype Electron Buncher system, and have been experimentally debugging it. We have addressed and resolved a number of challenging issues, some unanticipated, permitting us to demonstrate its basic functionality at Euclid\u2019s test facility. The first installation on the real commercial TEM at JEOL Boston facility is scheduled for January 2018. We have signed the first commercial contract for our newly developed Electron Buncher with the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Also, two utility patents were submitted during Phase II, with one granted and the second currently pending. What will be done in Phase IIA: In Phase IIA of the project, Euclid Techlabs LLC will improve on the original design that was developed in Phase II, based on the knowledge gained and lessons learned in developing the first prototype. With these improvements, we will develop a robust upgraded version of the Electron Buncher and deliver a solid industrialized product to the market by the end of Phase IIA. We also plan to develop a high frequency RF-based pulse compression column for the commercial UTEM. This new effort is in response to the complementary parameter space (e.g. 20fs, 1e4 electrons per pulse, MHz rep. rate) that our Electron Buncher provides. During Phase IIA, Euclid will increase our efforts to market the developed products. We plan to transition the TEM Electron Buncher and the TEM Pulse Compressor into production mode at the end of Phase IIA. Applications and benefits: Because TEM is a platform for various analytical methods, there are infinite application opportunities in energy and electronics to resolve charge (electronic and ionic) transport, and magnetic, plasmonic and excitonic dynamics in advanced functional materials."

        "abstract": "Advances in small satellite and remote sensing technology are revolutionizing the Earth observation industry and providing critical new sources of consistent, continuous data for atmospheric, ocean, and land use studies at a range of spatial and temporal extents. The increasing availability and falling cost of this data has created the need for innovative new tools that can help organizations rapidly process large raster datasets in transformative new ways without years of specialized training or large investments in proprietary software and technology infrastructure. The resulting web platform solves several significant challenges around raster data processing and user experience design that have heretofore prevented the effective use of remotely sensed data by many organizations. Overall Objectives: The overall research objective was to automate complex image processing tasks that are currently the province of a small group of highly skilled professionals and make them more accessible, understandable, and affordable. The platform addresses this need by providing an entirely new type of user experience that makes raster processing capabilities available over the web, not only to GIS analysts and other trained geospatial professionals, but also to non-technical users in organizations ranging from local governments and humanitarian groups to financial and utility firms. What was Done in Phase II?: The goal of the Phase II research was to build out the Phase I prototype into a production-ready platform by way of iterative rounds of software development and testing. These activities were supported by an Advisory Board of subject matter expects and Beta testing with members of the future user community. What is Planned for the Phase IIB Project?: Users of the Beta application have provided valuable feedback on new features and usability that demonstrate both a marketplace need for the product and insight into technical enhancements that will improve the opportunity within that marketplace. To that end, the platform will be enhanced with a robust capacity to support feature classification and object labeling within the platform through the integration of machine learning pipelines. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: The platform provides innovative tools to support ecosystems monitoring, change detection, long-range planning initiatives, and many other applications that will benefit current and future generations. Primary customers will include governments and private sector firms in the aerospace, water, satellite, and engineering industries organizations with a shared need to process Earth observation data. Partner relationships with micro-satellite companies, large prime contractors, nonprofits, and online mapping solutions are already generating revenue and interest."

        "abstract": "Development of low-cost optical components for X-Ray microscopy and extreme ultraviolet lithography will facilitate the reduction of semiconductor chip features to a few nanometers and spur new frontiers in nanotechnology, microelectronics, neuroscience and cell biology and maintain the US position as a global leader in technology. The manufacturing of the required optical components by vacuum thin film deposition requires unprecedented precision and accuracy and presents a significant process control challenge. Currently no process control system provides the accuracy, portability and ease-of-use for adoption in the X-ray and EUVL optics. Multiple other new-generation thin film technologies require a solution to the same process control challenge in order to foster new frontiers in technology. The development of new superalloys and high entropy alloys, especially needed for the manufacturing of new generation jet turbines for commercial and military applications is another application that urgently needs a solution. During the SBIR Phase II project it was demonstrated that the Atomic absorption spectroscopy is a promising process control method, capable of accurately measuring deposition rate and composition of deposited thin films and overcoming many limitations of current methods. This SBIR Phase IIB project continues the effort to finalize the development of a novel process control system, installable on a variety of vacuum deposition systems for the manufacturing of high-precision thin films. The system provides accurate and reliable deposition rate, film composition and film uniformity measurements for dynamic feedback process control. The system comprises two major components \u2013 a hardware module located outside the deposition chamber with element specific light sources and a portable fiber-optic-based monitoring frame installed inside the deposition chamber in the area surrounding the substrate. The prefabricated and optically aligned frame, installed inside the deposition chamber, eliminates costly equipment refurbishing and allows flexibility and customization. The unique system design allows accurate measurement of the element concentration on the vicinity of the substrate. During this Phase IIB project a commercial in situ atomic spectroscopy system for thin film process control will be finalized. The system will be validated for multiple chemical elements, needed for the new generation semiconductor lithography, compound semiconductors and aerospace applications. These are all new generation applications where no commercial metrology solution is available today. Next, the system will be installed and integrated into mainstream manufacturing equipment for semiconductor and aerospace application. Validating the system for operation on equipment, widely used by real manufacturer will prepare the system for faster acceptance by the major manufacturers and will speed time to market."

        "abstract": "Low cost and accurate monitoring of sequestered gases such as CO2 is critical to ensure that these gases are not reentering the atmosphere. Management requires, in part, improved atmospheric and ground monitoring of these greenhouse gases through sensors capable of measuring the subsurface flux, concentration and the carbon isotopologues of CO2 with high accuracy. These Monitoring, Verification and Accounting (MVA) tools needs to meet very strict requirements including; (a) the ability to differentiate between natural and anthropogenic CO2; (b) sensitive to the location of injected CO2 and any potential release; (c) robust enough for operating in harsh environments; and (d) capable of monitoring requirements across the range of storage formation(s), depth)s), temperature(s), pressure(s) and porocities. Statement of How this Problem or Situation is Being Addressed The ability to differentiate between natural and anthropogenic CO2 emissions requires detectors that can differentiate CO2 isotopologues. In this program an ultra-sensitive infrared CO2 sensor system, designed to optimally operate at 4.36 \uf06dm, where both CO2 isotopologues are optically active has been constructed and will be testing in actual MVA monitoring situations. The sensor is able to accuracy and rapidly measure the concentration and isotopic ratio of CO2 isotopologues, and thus determine the gas origin. What was Done in Phase I\/Phase II project In the Phase I and Phase II program, an infrared detector optimized for detection at 4.36 \uf06dm was designed, fabricated, and tested. This detector was used in a subsurface CO2 gas monitoring system first developed at Montana State University. This upgraded system can detect the different isotopes of CO2 and was field tested at the Montana State University\u2019s Zero Emission Research Technology (ZERT) subsurface CO2 field site where the 13CO2 and 12CO2 isotopes where monitored. Total gas concentration and isotopic ratio was measured successfully. What is Planned for Phase IIB The system developed in Phase II will be re-engineered to make it more commercially producible. Wireless communication and multiple probes will also be added. The system will then be field tested in actual enhanced oil recovery and sequestration monitoring sites. Commercial Application and Other Benefits In addition to direct MVA applications, particularly monitoring of CO2 anthropogenic activities and sequestration sites, this technology can be readily translated to other applications including monitoring of other gasses that have absorption bands in the infrared."

        "abstract": "At the present, the United States does not have a designated disposal site for used nuclear fuel \u2014 the nation therefore faces the prospect of extended long\u2010term storage (i.e., &gt;60 years) and deferred transportation of used fuel at operating and decommissioned nuclear power plant sites. We need to augment nuclear waste canister Ageing Management programs with Modeling capability that is comprehensive, physics based and can be tailored to different OEM Geometries, Material Properties, use existing data and accommodate data gaps, incorporate incoming inspection data, account for location based environmental conditions, and variability. The site and canister specific results can be derived from the virtual twin simulation model. In Phase I, we established feasibility of the above concept. In Phase II, we developed a Virtual Twin for spent nuclear fuel storage systems. The main elements of the model are as follows: Environmental (atmospheric site conditions), OEM supplied canister design information, Failure Modes, Data-Driven Corrosion Modeling, Synthetic Data Generation (using a high-fidelity multi-physics simulation), Probabilistic Inference, Probabilistic Uncertainty Management, Multi-Model Data Fusion (for integration of Digital Twin and NDE datasets as well as Inspection reports). We focused our efforts into modeling CISCC and welding failure modes that are predominant in this canister. The Virtual Twin model can use a variety of (conflicting, misaligned) simulation models. The majority of these capabilities are enabled by using advance probabilistic models. Having such a tool provides utilities\/operators\/OEMs and regulators reassurance throughout different stages of development. Also, variety of inspection data can be evaluated via the same Virtual Twin model. Most importantly results of various field data or simulation data can be integrated to provide a comprehensive database. We Are Proposing to Extend and Mature Previous Phase II Work to Include the Following Innovative Features and Improvements:Include Other Manufacturers; Improving Simulation\u2019s Accuracy and Reliability; Consider Effects of Seismic Loads; Consider Transportations Loads; Dual Purpose Canisters (DPC); Expanded GUI; Risk Ranking Analysis; Variability; Include Other external factors. The resulting technology from this effort can be applied initially to assess state of health of canisters used to store nuclear waste. It can also be used for helping utilities with relicensing applications for extending canister useful life. It can be used for a wide range of applications engaged for monitoring of machinery and structural components. The commercial intent is to produce a beta-tested software tool for commercial markets. Potential commercial applications include diagnostics\/prognostics of machinery and structural health monitoring."

        "abstract": "Multipactor is an incessant problem that plagues numerous commercial and military systems, including satellites and particle accelerator components such as klystrons, high-power radio frequency windows, and free electron lasers. Current solutions, including traditional coatings such as titanium nitride, or the use of magnetic systems to suppress secondary electron emission, are insufficient to support device operations at high frequencies (1 \u2013 40GHz) and high operating powers. Under Phase I Nokomis demonstrated a unique thin film material with an extremely low secondary electron coefficient and then confirmed through experiment that this nanocoating does not affect the performance of radio frequency devices. Under Phase II, the deposition process was matured to coat complex geometries, the chemistry of the coatings refined for huge performance gains, and will culminate in the demonstration of multipactor suppression on a coax structure at high power and high frequency. Under this Phase IIa effort, Nokomis will work closely with industry and government stakeholders determine service requirements for a coating solution and refine the deposition process to produce nanocoatings that meet these service requirements while maintaining extremely low secondary electron emission. Nokomis will then work directly with industry and government experts to conclusively demonstrate the efficacy of the coating on high-power microwave devices in representative environments. Finally, the effort will conclude with the development of a web-based COMSOL application designed to provide industry with a means for calculating the anticipated performance gains for a coated component before and after technology adoption. In succeeding, Nokomis will enable high power microwave device manufacturers to achieve much higher power levels and higher frequencies, drastically reducing the size and weight of these devices and enabling new devices that were previously size weight and power limited. The technology will enable large advances in communication, fundamental research, manufacturing, radar, medical diagnostic and radiotherapy equipment."

        "abstract": "Seawater contains about 3 parts per billion of uranium. With a total ocean volume of approximately 1.3\uf0b4109 km3, there is at least 4.5 billion tons of uranium in seawater which is about 1000 times the amount of uranium known to exist in terrestrial ores. Mining uranium from seawater is economically feasibility if an efficient, reusable and low-cost adsorbent could be developed. In the past year, we have produced kilogram quantities of a highly efficient polymer adsorbent (LCW fiber) derived from cheap acrylic fiber (yarn) for extracting uranium from seawater. Gram quantities ofyellowcake(uranium oxide) have been produced using the fiber adsorbent exposed to a laboratory circulating flume system using seawater pumped from the Sequim Bay, Washington. Economic analysis shows a substantial reduction in the overall cost of the production of uranium from seawater using the LCW adsorbent compared to previously published investigations. Although the results obtained so far are encouraging, certain key information and continued manufacturing and process optimization is still needed for developing a competitive commercial process for production of uranium from seawater. The proposed SBIR Phase IIA study intends to obtain this key information with the goal of making uranium production from seawater economically competitive with the land-based uranium mining methods. A major focus will be on continued real-world testing and scaling up of the technology to commercial scale. First, we need to demonstrate the performance of the adsorbent fiber in an actual ocean deployment, using masses of adsorbent anticipated for commercial scale applications. Second, we need to determine how the capacity and adsorption rate varies with temperature, seeking formulations that are highest performing for different seawater temperatures.Co-extraction of other metals from seawater shouldbe examined which could lower the production cost of uranium. Finally, we need to scale-up and optimize the process focusing on developing a process that allows for multiple re-uses of the adsorbent material making this uranium-from-seawater technology economically favorable."

        "abstract": "Additive manufacturing (AM), esp. laser AM, becomes a powerful tool to replace conventional methods such as casting and hot spray, due to its cost effectiveness and capability of making complex structure and composition. However, there is lack of efficient ways to do pre-, in-, and post process detection of defects, cracks, surface roughness, and alloy composition, to make nuclear quality parts. Statement of how this problem or situation is being addressed. Based on our patented laser AM technology and the world\u2019s first fs fiber laser AM system (2016 R&amp;D Award, Tungsten LAM System), PolarOnyx proposes, for the first time, a pulsed fs fiber laser based AM process to overcome these difficulties and meet the requirement of making high temperature and high quality nuclear reactor components. Our AM system will use only one single fs fiber laser source to detect\/inspect in-process and post process quality, and manufacture additively and subtractively. This all-in-one multi-functional capability (NDI, SM and AM, controllable laser energy\/power, controllable melting temperature and HAZ) is not achievable for CW laser AM and will significantly reduce the building time and cost. Its material absorption independent feature opens a new and unprecedented opportunity for multi-material 3D manufacturing. By integrating with fs laser SM, controllable layer-by-layer and line-by-line process can be done to micron level precision, so complex shape with fine structure is achievable. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: In addition to the metal 3D AM applications, material processing is another major commercial application for this project. This includes (1) Photonic device fabrications, such as waveguide, coupler, WDM, modulator, and switching; (2) all types of metal processing such as welding, cutting, annealing, and drilling; (3) semiconductor and microelectronics manufacturing such as lithography, inspection, control, defect analysis and repair, and via drilling; (4) marking of all materials including plastic, metals, and silicon; (5) other materials processing such as rapid prototyping, desk top manufacturing, micromachining, photofinishing, embossed holograms, and grating manufacturing."

        "abstract": "Nuclear detection and spectroscopy is used to detect and characterize global nuclear security threats and prevent spread of materials, technology, and expertise related to weapons of mass destruction. High performance scintillation detectors are the backbone of such tools. Recent advances in scintillators have demonstrated superior spectroscopic qualities, rivaling those of the semiconductor detectors. However, their performance is significantly hampered by other elements of the detection chain. The most prominent among these is current state-of-the-art photocathodes. Development of photocathodes with higher quantum efficiency and a more uniform response over large areas will effectively address this issue, and enable such very low cost workhorse materials as the NaI:Tl to be used in applications where only advanced and costly material can now be considered. RMD proposes to manufacture advanced photocathodes by thermal evaporation using the low-cost, proprietary, pre-synthesized compounds, a transformational technology that has never been imaginable before. The evaporated cathodes will be evaluated over large areas, for UV-visible sensitivity, fast response, high-QE, and response uniformity. Research will focus on bulk preparation of compounds using impurity-free raw elements and the subsequent thermal vapor deposition of the stoichiometric photocathode thin films in a PMT envelope. The goal of the proposed Phase I is to demonstrate feasibility of our technique. During Phase I, we will conduct (1) chemical synthesis of bulk photocathode compounds, (2) build a glass phototube apparatus for thermal evaporation, and (3) synthesize photocathodes and characterize their performance to demonstrate feasibility. We will work closely with a PMT manufacturer for the translation of this transformative technology into commercial photodetectors."

RMD proposes to address this challenge by applying a Xe gas diffusion barrier coating to the surface of the plastic scintillator cell to prevent the diffusion of the radioactive Xenon gas. During Phase I, Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) of highly transparent aluminum oxide (Al2O3) films will be applied as a Xe-barrier coating on the plastic scintillator surface. These coatings can be applied at low temperatures without affecting the properties of the plastic scintillator such as energy resolution and light collection efficiency. These coatings are robust and pinhole free coatings that can be deposited on 3 dimensional surfaces."

        "abstract": "Modern fossil fuel energy production requires large scale machines with big size componentry. Such processes require using high temperatures and thus, chemically stable materials resistant against creep, wear, and high temperature oxidation. Manufacturing large size parts from high temperature alloys runs in many challenges related to chemical homogeneity\/ phase composition stability and microstructure control to maintain in big volumes high and uniform mechanical properties, residual thermal stresses, and others. There is a necessity to develop processes to make large size components at low cost for fossil fuel energy production. It is proposed to solve this problem by building large size parts from high temperature alloys using Plasma Transferred Arc (PTA) Additive Manufacturing technique. ATS-MER possesses two PTA machines with a capability to build 4 feet x 4 feet x 17 feet components. CNC robotic manipulator will be equipped with a complete temperature\/processing parameters loop to automatically adjust the processing parameters to ensure the constant\/optimal pool temperature and uniformity in properties. This will also provide a possibility to accurately control grain size and to provide a fine grain microstructure in sections that require high room temperature strength, and to selectively grow grain in high temperature sections where high creep resistance is needed. To mitigate a thermal stresses issue, a special heater will be built to release stresses during deposition. In cases when large size parts require various materials in different sections (for example, to withstand creep and fatigue during operation in a turbine disk where blades are attached), it is intended to bond dissimilar materials during one stage PTA deposition. The mechanical properties of PTA deposited alloy 718 will be investigated and compared with those for commercially available alloy 718. The PTA technology to make large size tie-bolts and turbine disks will be developed. A disk for a real gas turbine and a tie-bolt will be produced by PTA, machined, heat treated and delivered to DOE. The technology to apply a dissimilar high temperature alloy on the periphery of 718 disk will be developed. The microstructures and mechanical properties of the deposited materials will be investigated."

        "abstract": "Outside of fuel and heat value of domestic coal there are very limited applications to manufacture carbon products including the byproduct coal tar pitch (CTP) which is a high value feedstock to produce high value carbon products whose value exceeds the fuel and heat values of the coal. There is no current domestic producer of CTP in spite of its value to produce battery anodes, graphite fibers, carbon composites, graphene, carbon dots\/nanomaterials, supercapacitors, etc. Although the approach is to utilize domestic coal to produce byproducts and coal tar pitch (CTP) which is to be purified with a high mesophase fraction, due to the limitations of a Phase I only the CTP purification and mesophase is being produced and utilized as a feedstock to produce graphite for lithium ion battery anodes. The utilization of domestic coal to produce the CTP would then be undertaken in Phase II or another Phase I. An imported in stock CTP shall be utilized as a feedstock for purification and maximizing mesophase generation that shall be (1) pyrolyzed to produce a graphitic particulate with enhanced lithium capacity in standard Li-ion battery anodes, (2) utilized as a binder to make carbon-carbon (C-C) composite anodes for Li-ion batteries that have enhanced lithium capacity and maintains non-flammability if punctured that is fully demonstrated and patented, and (3) vacuum volatized into a silicon (Si) particle fluid bed to coat the Si particulate with a graphite coating for additive to all Li-ion battery anodes that enhances performance."

        "abstract": "There are no compact, high-power, high-efficiency RF sources in the 300 \u2013 650 MHz frequency range for ion and proton accelerators and colliders. Inductive output tubes are unable to provide the power levels required, and klystrons are extremely large and expensive in this frequency range. Calabazas Creek Research Inc. is proposing to develop multiple beam, gridded tubes to produce high power RF in this frequency range. Gridded tubes, such as triodes and tetrodes, routinely provide RF power with high efficiency at these frequencies; however, current, single beam devices cannot provide the required power. This program will use modern, 3D analysis tools and techniques to dramatically increase the available power from gridded tubes and achieve efficiencies exceeding 80%. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: Triodes and tetrodes are extremely compact, high efficiency sources of RF power. The first gridded tubes were developed more than a century ago; however, modern design codes and materials now provide resources to dramatically increase the power and frequency. The simple design will reduce the cost of RF sources for ion and proton accelerators for scientific, medical, and industrial applications. If successfully developed, they will provide the most compact, cost- effective RF sources in this frequency range."

        "abstract": "DOE is seeking methods to improve manufacturing of small modular reactors. Additive Manufacturing (AM) processes are desirable given the limited production basis and high quality necessary for nuclear components. Techniques to decrease the schedule of manufacturing and increase the confidence of the part\u2019s microstructure are sought. Current inspection methods to maintain production speed and efficiency are lacking. To address this critical need, we a model- based ultrasonic scattering technique (UST) that qualifies witness coupons independent of the additive manufacturing method. The UST is microstructure-sensitive, which facilitates normalization across various AM methods and provides detailed information about material properties and performance. The witness coupon is a sample of simple geometry built alongside the component of interest in order to characterize the process at every build. By evaluating the microstructure post-process, the need for further heat treatment can be assessed. When parts are qualified for service, unnecessary heat treatment and processing can be avoided which will reduce the overall time and cost of manufacturing while guaranteeing quality and performance. The UST system consists of a focused immersion ultrasonic probe paired with a high-precision scanning system. At each scanning position, as the ultrasonic wave propagates, reflects and scatters through the microstructure of the AM part, the received signals contain encoded information about internal features. Analytical models and advanced signal processing algorithms are used to translate ultrasonic scattering data to spatial maps of microstructural parameters such as grain size, modulus, presence of heterogeneities (including porosity), and residual stress. The focus of the Phase I program is to demonstrate the feasibility of the ultrasonic scattering technique in characterizing microstructure and material properties for components made with varying additive manufacturing parameters, which will serve to determine whether heat treatment and\/or additional processing is necessary. This outcome will lay the groundwork for optimizing the process monitoring technique for large scale inspections that guarantee the component reliability. Phase I efforts will concentrate on optimizing analytical models to account for microstructures found in AM parts and experimentally evaluating the validity of such models. By the end of Phase I, components made with various process parameters that induce mechanical and microstructural variability will be fully characterized using the UST and validated through traditional destructive testing. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: In Phase II, BTC will focus on refining the electronics and data processing algorithms in the prototype, optimizing the sensitivity, and testing components of different feedstock types and power sources. For Phase III, BTC will package the system\/software to accommodate large volume production and ensure suitability for defense and industry partners. The final product will serve as a qualification technique of AM parts and systems."

        "abstract": "With development of shale gas fracking, large amounts of methane and ethane have now become available at low cost. With this low cost ethane it is desirable to convert low cost ethane to high value ethylene. Oxidative dehydration (ODH) for low cost conversion of ethane to ethylene is a potentially attractive route. ODH is an exothermic process for converting ethane to ethylene. By contrast processes today to make ethylene from petroleum are endothermic. Therefore by definition ODH is a heat process intensification process. A major limitation of ODH is the cost of concentrating the 25% ethylene from ODH to 99.9% ethylene (polymer grade ethylene) for chemical processing. CMS has recently developed custom amorphous fluoropolymers (CAF) membranes which show excellent ethylene-ethane flux, selectivity, and stability. This program will modify CAF and associated membranes for separating and concentrating ethylene to make polymer grade ethylene (99.9% ethylene) at costs 25% lower than distillation. CMS will develop enhanced CAF membranes for low cost concentrating of 25% ethylene (coming from the ODH reactor) to polymer grade ethylene (99.9% ethylene) for costs 25% lower than distillation. Phase I will show process feasibility."

        "abstract": "We will develop an acoustically-telemetered, frequency-multiplexed, gamma-heated thermoacoustic sensors that can simultaneously monitor local gamma flux and coolant temperature at multiple locations in the core of an operating commercial nuclear reactor. These sensors will require no external power source and will telemeter temperature encoded as the frequency of the sound radiated by the sensor and gamma flux as amplitude of the sound radiated by the sensor. Since the frequency of the sound produced by the sensor depends on the sound speed of the gas that fills the sensor and the sensor\u2019s length, several such sensors can operate simultaneously in a single core, at different frequencies, so that the information they transmit will be unique for each sensor location. The core of a nuclear reactor is one of the most challenging environments on the planet and there is a need to monitor temperature and energy flux without running electrical wires through the reactor. We proposed to handle this problem using acoustics.. In addition, it is somewhat ironic that such reactors might produce 1 GW of electrical power for sale to public utilities, but have serious difficulty providing 10 W of electrical power within the reactor vessel to operate sensors and telemeter the sensor\u2019s information to operators outside the pressure vessel. We propose thermo- acoustic sensors can solve these problems. The thermoacoustics sensor provides both coolant temperature, (coded in the frequency) and gamma flux (coded as an amplitude ratio). The amplitude of the radiated sound energy produced by such a thermoacoustic sensor is proportional to the heating provided by gamma- absorption , but the received amplitude outside the reactor vessel will depend upon the conditions of the coolant that surround the resonator and provides the medium for transmission of the sound. By measuring the ratio of the fundamental resonance amplitude, A1, to the amplitude of second harmonic of that resonance, A2, the determination of the energetic particle flux becomes independent of the propagation characteristics of the surrounding coolant fluid or gas (e.g., temperature, pressure, gaseous inclusions). The fundamental frequency of the radiated sound, f1, is related to the absolute (Kelvin) temperature of the coolant, T, in a way that keeps the ratio, of frequency to root Temperature , equal to a constant. Multiple sensors will be frequency-division-multiplexed. The frequency- temperature invariant can be made different for each sensor in a core by adjustment of each sensor\u2019s overall effective length by adjustment of the ratio of the gas mixture in the sensor, so that signals for flux and temperature from different sensor locations within the reactor\u2019s core can be detected simultaneously. The sensor does not require an external electrical power supply nor does the telemetry require either cables or electrical power for a dedicated \u201cdata transmitter.\u201d Thermoacoustic sensors would not have been incapacitated by the type of overall electrical power failure that occurred during the Fukushima disaster of 2011. Since external electrical power is not required there is no need for a power cable. Since the temperature (frequency) and flux (amplitude) information is transmitted through the reactor vessel as sound, there is no need for signal cables either. The sensor exploits the energy-rich environment in the core to generate the heat that produces the acoustic signals via thermoacoustic processes that are simple and require no moving mechanical parts. The sensors have no temperature or radiation sensitive materials that limits their operation or accuracy in the high temperature and the dense particle flux environments within the core of a nuclear reactor. The gamma-absorbing heat exchangers can be produced economically by 3-D printing in metal. Temperature and energy flux is to be measured using thermoacoustic sensors without the need for electrical power. At the end of Phase I we will complete the design and modeling of the device and be able to move into a fabrication \/ demonstration prototype for Phase II. Sensor for Nuclear Reactors, Sensors for other industrial applications where avoidance of electrical power is needed or welcome."

        "abstract": "Power generation plants are increasingly vulnerable to malicious attacks from both from insider threats and cybercriminals. To prevent and mitigate cyber threats, plant operators should be able to recognize whether data from plant sensors, critical components, etc. are compromised. While there have been advancements in automated situational awareness tools for power distribution, no existing security solutions can protect fossil power generation assets. Advanced tools are needed to constantly scan a multitude of sensor data to assess the health of the power plant as well as to recognize malicious behavior and automatically trigger countermeasures to mitigate it. A novel automated situational awareness tool is required to enhance reliability of the fossil power fleet and protect energy systems. This need will be addressed through the proposed novel Data Ingestion, Analysis, and Situational Awareness Tool. Unlike network intrusion detection systems that identify attacks by analyzing network traffic, and unlike existing blockchain-based plant security solutions that are focused on protecting data but not detecting intrusions, the proposed tool innovatively integrates applications of machine learning to recognize malicious behavior by constant analysis of data from sensors with the secure blockchain protocol to transfer data within the network. The tool will use the machine learning algorithms to calculate each sensor\u2019s probability of attack, and artificial intelligence to trigger automatic countermeasures as well as alert plant personnel. A prototype will be implemented to establish a proof-of-concept, demonstrate fetching and analysis of sensor data, and integrate a blockchain-based approach as a security solution. The prototype will implement periodic transfer of sample data into secure, centralized storage. It will also implement an adaptive immune system module that applies machine learning techniques to analyze the data for unusual activities and display the analysis results on a simplified user interface in order to monitor the system state in real time, show alerts, and send manual commands to mitigate detected intrusions."

        "abstract": "Launching radio frequency (RF) waves from the high-field side (HFS) of a tokamak has the potential to be an efficient off-axis current drive method while reducing the plasma-material interaction issues of the antenna. Researchers at the Plasma Science and Fusion Center (PSFC) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have proposed to reuse existing equipment at MIT, including CPI klystrons, to demonstrate HFS RF launching at DIII-D. The current klystron driver is not scalable as the number of klystrons increases; is so large that it cannot be located close to the klystrons, which increases the risk of damaging klystrons during a fault; requires all klystrons be shut down in the event of a fault; and cannot operate for the full length of a DIII-D pulse. Eagle Harbor Technologies (EHT), Inc. is proposing to develop the next-generation klystron driver for use by MIT for HFS RF launching experiments at DIII-D. The next-generation klystron driver will take advantage of the high frequency solid-state switching capabilities developed by EHT with support of the DOE SBIR program. The high frequency nature will allow for the development of a more compact system, which can be placed closer to the klystrons. This system will be designed so that there is one driver per klystron, which will allow the system to scale as more klystrons are added and experiments to continue in the event of a klystron fault. EHT has previously developed a series-stack of solid-state switches and 800 V full-bridge rectifiers for driving plasma injectors. In the Phase I program, EHT will develop a high voltage full-bridge rectifier utilizing the EHT HV solid-state switch to convert the rectified three-phase high voltage to 50 kV pulse required for klystron driving to demonstrate the system at a breadboard-level. EHT will design the system and test each component prior to assembly. Finally, the full breadboard-level klystron driver will be tested. With the test results, EHT will prepare an initial design for implementation in a potential Phase II program. The goal of Phase II would be to develop a full prototype that can be tested with the MIT klystrons."

        "abstract": "Deployment of the smart grid that relies on new intelligent technologies using two-way communications and Internet connectivity increases vulnerability of the grid to potential cyberattacks. Although many cybersecurity (detection or prevention) software tools have been developed, all of them have limitations and, thus, cannot deliver protection against cyberattacks in the smart grid. An advanced cybersecurity tool must be developed to provide more intelligent shields to fend off known and new-generation cyberattacks to secure the electronic devices associated with the generation of solar energy (for example, inverters, DC-DC optimizers, and smart meters) that are used in the smart grid. Such a tool will help to ensure access-control, authorization, authentication, confidentiality, integrity, availability, and non-repudiation for the future smart grid and will support the SunShot initiative. The proposed risk-based cybersecurity software tool is based on intelligent decision-making algorithms that employ (1) machine learning and two branches of advanced statistical analysis and (2) correlation between control commands and states of electronic devices. These provide the artificial intelligence needed to detect and mitigate both known and new threats in the future smart grid, allowing more accurate attack detections and quicker responses compared to other methods, thus, improving the cybersecurity of electronic devices associated with the generation of solar energy. The new tool continuously monitors activities and states of devices in the grid, updates behavior models, and accurately detects, classifies, and intelligently responds to malicious activities and device failures in real time. A large-scale intelligent intrusion\/failure detection software tool will be developed to evaluate system performance. Feasibility of the approach will be demonstrated by assembling and testing a technology readiness level 4 prototype. The prototype will demonstrate the capability to detect attack patterns and device failure and predict attacks in real time. The metrics that determine the prototype\u2019s efficacy and performance will be identified."

        "abstract": "The transition of cellulosic nanomaterials to pilot-scale production makes them feasible for use in a variety of industrial applications including oil and gas, wastewater treatment, electronics, and others. A significant hindrance for further advancement is the difficulty of drying these materials, and long distance shipping of them is not economical while they contain significant water content. One of the major manufacturing challenges is to obtain dry cellulosic nanomaterials while maintaining their nanoscale dimensions. Development of dewatering technology that implements the dielectrophoretic enhancement of integrated electrospray in vacuum and lyophilization, allows the drying of nanocellulose without compromising nanoscaling. Atomization of the nanomaterial pulp allows mitigation of the agglomeration of nanocellulose particles and dramatically increases the evaporation of generated droplets due to extended surface area and high curvature. During the Phase I effort, plans call for building, evaluating, improving, and demonstrating a benchtop prototype of a reactor with a dielectrophoretic enhancement of dewatering, to define the degree of improvement compared to other dewatering approaches, and to develop the engineering concept for the demonstration, pilot-scale reactor in Phase II."

        "abstract": "The US Department of Energy (DOE) Office of High Energy Physics (HEP) in collaboration with the US National Laboratories is engaged in an ongoing R&amp;D program to develop Superconducting Radio Frequency (SRF) cavities for assembly into CryoModules (CMs) with higher accelerating gradients (Eacc) and higher Q\u2019s, while simultaneously lowering fabrication costs. State of the art SRF cavities manufactured from bulk Nb sheet have reached a level of technology maturity where medium and large\u2010scale projects in High Energy and Nuclear Physics can be realized. While the performance of these bulk Nb cavities has reached a plateau, the costs of the raw Nb material has not, increasing 300% in the past decade. Revolutionary not evolutionary techniques are needed to dramatically reduce both materials and fabrication costs. One approach to reducing SRF cavity materials costs has been to replace the expensive bulk Nb (\u223c$300\/lb.) cavities with an Nb thin films deposited on a less expensive bulk material such as Cu (\u223c$3\/lb.). Advances in thin film deposition techniques leading to lower defects of Nb films offer great promise for improved performance compared with earlier Nb film coated cavities such as those used in LEP. Alternate thin film coatings such as Nb3Sn materials could also lead to higher temperature superconductors, further reducing the cost of cryogenics. Another approach to achieving higher performance SRF cavities has been the fabrication of Nb3Sn SRF cavities. State-of the-Art Nb3Sn SRF cavity fabrication involves Sn diffusion into a bulk Nb cavity. While encouraging results for Eacc and Q0 have been obtained for this approach, fundamental limitations in performance may still exist in trying to utilize older\/pre-existing Nb cavity scaffolds\/substrates that were previously fabricated with inferior bulk Nb material. More importantly, costs for new cavity construction still remain high due to the underlying scaffold material consisting of expensive bulk Nb. A new approach to Nb3Sn SRF cavity fabrication that offers both superior RF performance while replacing the expensive bulk Nb scaffold with a lower cost alternative that possess the necessary mechanical and thermal performance would be highly desirous and provides the motivation for the proposed effort. Energy-to-Power Solutions (e2P) of Tallahassee, FL in collaboration with the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (TJNAF), ExOne Corporation, and the Hackett-Brass Foundry, proposes a revolutionary approach to Nb3Sn SRF cavity fabrication using a synergistic technologies consisting of high quality Nb thin films deposited on low cost bulk \u201ccasted\u201d bronze (Cu-Sn) substrates. e2P\u2019s proposed Nb3Sn SRF cavity fabrication process has its historical roots in the so-called \u201cBronze Route\u201d (BR) wire\/tape process that was thoroughly researched and developed decades previously and is still used today in the large scale CS and TF magnets being developed for ITER. In addition to further reduce fabrication costs and development times; the proposed bronze \u201ccasted molds\u201d will be manufactured using an extremely low cost, rapid, and proven process. This process could lead to the revolutionary breakthrough needed for next generation Nb3Sn SRF cavity development."

        "abstract": "One of the major objectives in high energy particle physics and a top priority for the Department of Energy is the elucidation of the nature of dark matter, a discovery which would truly be transformative. In many cases, the ability to advance the research further is limited by the capabilities of the available detectors. Fortunately, recent advances in cryogenic bolometers have significantly improved detector sensitivity and background rejection, with sub-keV thresholds now possible. In this proposed effort, we will investigate metallic super-conducting bolometers, made of zinc and aluminum single crystals, designed for detecting low energy recoils. Such detectors, when operated at temperatures of 10-50 mK, should reduce sensitivity to background electromagnetic radiation (X-rays, gamma-rays) while achieving high sensitivity to low energy recoils.Radiation Monitoring Devices, Inc. (RMD), in collaboration with Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), has recently begun to develop processes to purify and grow high purity single crystals. This work is an outgrowth of previous work done on the preparation of very high purity scintillator crystals. Initial samples of zinc and aluminum crystals have already been prepared. Preliminary data taken with a zinc crystal show high purity and low contamination of radiogenics. The proposed DOE SBIR effort should lead to sensitive superconducting detectors that can be used for the detection of neutrinos and dark matter candidates, such as WIMPS and axions. The essence of the proposed research is to perform a rigorous investigation of the purification and crystal growth of zinc and aluminum single crystals, and to characterize the purity and detection properties of the crystals produced. Bolometer detectors will be built with the necessary size, and tested at low temperatures by our collaborators at MIT. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: Commercial and societal benefits of the proposed technology result from its uses. The proposed work would provide a new supply of radio-pure bolometer crystals that would enable new, higher sensitivity physics experiments to be designed and performed, advancing the frontier of scientific knowledge. The detectors could also be used to monitor the neutrino flux emitted by nuclear reactors to provide real time information of the status of the reactor cores. Techniques developed for ultra-pure, low-radioactivity crystal manufacturing could also be applied to many other materials in all areas of technology where the performance of devices depends on material purity, such as other devices used in scientific research, optical components, non-destructive testing, and homeland security."

        "abstract": "Electric Grid maintenance and repair requires highly skilled labor to complete necessary critical tasks. Currently, much of the experienced- workforce is rapidly approaching retirement and there is the possibility of diminished appropriate skill level as well as the potential for lost institutional knowledge. In addition, technology is rapidly changing and the grid becoming more complex, making it challenging for the electric utility workforce to be expert in all aspects and systems of the grid. In order to mitigate these problems, a new system for training, support and reachback is required. RMD proposes a revolutionary use of new technology for field maintenance based on augmented reality (AR) and technology assisted training to integrate into the planning, management, training and operations aspects of remote maintenance. Using intuitive human-machine interfaces (HMI), a robust AR platform, and network secure communications, the system will offer powerful management tools and provide each maintainer with individualized guidance normally associated with an on-site expert human trainer. This effort is based on previous work done at RMD that provides an ideal platform for the development of the next generation field support system. The goal of Phase I is to show the feasibility of a field deployable augmented reality system that can be used to remotely supervise, as well as train, multiple crews deployed in the field. In Phase I, RMD will perform research and development that starts with a study of the systems in place to understand where the most significant impacts can be realized. The bulk of the work in Phase I will be to develop and prove the effectiveness of an appropriately integrated toolset for augmenting the interface between centralized supervisor and crew. RMD will conclude Phase I with a proof-of-concept prototype that demonstrates key aspects of a model system showing where and how the tool can benefit maintenance teams in the service or repair of complex grid systems."

        "abstract": "With a vast network of over 400 thousand miles of transmission pipeline and over one million miles of aging distribution pipeline in the U.S., it is a huge endeavor to continuously monitor pipeline integrity, detect leaks, and repair leaks. Conventional methods to repair leaks are labor intensive and could take many hours during which there are chances for leak propagation, excessive release of methane (greenhouse gas) into the surroundings, and potential loss of property and life due to ensuing dangerous conditions. Pipeline operators are subject to significant revenue losses and increased expenses from these leaks and also from intentional attempts to compromise pipe integrity including the theft of natural gas. A resident robot residing in a \u201csmart branch\u201d of transmission pipe will respond to urgent requests to repair pipeline leaks. After entering the pipe and using the natural gas flow to propel itself downstream, the robot will identify the threat location, inspect for leakages, and perform appropriate repairs to prevent further leakage. Minimal design, low power consumption, and the use of energy harvesting techniques will allow the robot to travel long distances while keeping the overall system cost low. By integrating into existing communication and health monitoring systems employed by pipeline operators, and by making minimal changes to physical infrastructure, the resulting rapid adoption of the robotic system will quickly resolve this ubiquitous nationwide problem of repairing pipe leakages. Phase I of this project will focus on testing and evaluating (i) the leak detection sensor in a high pressure, high flow test environment, and (ii) the internal repair methods for fixing various sizes and types of leaks. The robotic system including the launch and retrieval station will be conceptually designed and the business logic involving robotic operations will be refined. The system power budget will be estimated and the feasibility of the robotic system will be evaluated. The robot can be used to repair not only leaks but also incipient leaks. The robotic system will help pipeline operators meet regulations for methane emissions and lower their insurance costs. Reducing methane emissions positively impacts climate change and in turn the public. Climate change has shown to cause an increased intensity of storms and longer droughts. Indirect impacts include increased insurance premiums, food prices, and allergy seasons."

        "abstract": "Pre-combustionCO2 removalisanattractivecarboncaptureprocessduetothehigherCO2 concentration in the stream and higher system pressure after the water-gas-shift reaction. These characteristics permit CO2 capture in an energy-efficient and cost-effective way because of hundreds times higher throughput and a much smaller equipment footprint than in current post-combustion CO2 capture scenarios. Current CO2 removal technologies for gasification or future integrated coal gasification combined cycle (IGCC) mainly include solvent-based CO2 capture, and sorbent-based process, which are complicated and energy intensive. Membrane separation in CO2 capture holds the substantial key to the economic viability of our national energy systems because of low energy consumption, capability for continuous operation, ease of operation, and cost-effectiveness. In this program, a novel, robust, high temperature catalytic membrane reaction (CMR) with high selectivity and permeability, excellent hydrothermal and chemical stability, and excellent durability in harsh operating conditions will be developed. The integrated catalytic membrane reaction system will combine in one-stage high temperature water-gas-shift (WGS) reaction with a H2 separation membrane to produce H2 while simultaneously capturing compressed CO2 for further sequestration or other applications."

        "abstract": "The ability to robustly generate increased pulsed power levels at low cost is a challenge for the fusion energy community. Many applications supported by the Department of Energy\u2019s (DOE) Fusion Energy Science (FES) program would benefit from a commercially available low-cost, robust, high current\/voltage pulsed solid-state power supplies including pulsed magnetics, feedback and control systems for dynamic plasma stabilization in tokamaks, inductive and arc plasma sources, Radio Frequency (RF) helicity and flux injection, RF plasma heating and current drive schemes, ion beam generation, and RF pre-ionizer systems. The Pegasus Toroidal Experiment at the University of Wisconsin utilizes solid-state switching for both Local Helicity Injection (LHI) and for magnet driving and control. Pegasus will upgrade their power systems in the near future. A new modular system that addresses the output ripple, efficient capacitor bank utilization, and electromagnetic interference is required. Eagle Harbor Technologies (EHT), Inc. is proposing to develop a \u0106uk converter for fusion science applications. The \u0106uk converter has low output ripple; high efficiency; voltage gain greater than one, allowing for deeper energy storage utilization; continuous power flow that lowers output EMI reducing noise generation; continuous input and output current \u2013 energy flow from the series capacitor allows for greater control of the injector currents; series arrangements can be utilized that isolates individual switch modules so a failure does not potentially damage all solid-state switches. EHT will utilize previously developed precision gate drive technology that allows for high frequency switching, which reduces the capacitor and inductor values significantly, making the design more compact and lower cost. In the Phase I program, EHT will design, build, and test a \u0106uk converter module prototype. EHT will SPICE model the \u0106uk converter module to identify challenges that must be overcome in the design process. The PCBs will be designed utilizing EHT switching technology. The \u0106uk converter module will be assembled and tested at EHT to map out the safe operating area. With the testing results, the \u0106uk converter module design will be reviewed and a plan developed for second generation module to be built in a potential Phase II program. EHT will work with Pegasus to develop a plan to produce \u0106uk converter modules that can be delivered to Pegasus for their magnet upgrade in a potential Phase II program."

        "abstract": "Building energy modeling typically does not have rigorous model quality control procedures, which not only hurts the accuracy of the model results but also causes more than 90% of modeling projects to fall behind the schedule in the United States. The result is a $300 million loss every year for the architecture, engineering, and construction industry. A solution is being developed that introduces an innovative energy model development and management system to the conventional energy modeling process. The development will equip the model with the abilities to intelligently detect and debug potential model errors and automatically update the model with measured building operational changes. The final tool enables the continuous model quality assurance to be available for design professionals, facility managers, and energy code enforcement authorities, saving them time and cost of conducting building energy-related analysis. In Phase I, the development will focus on: 1) establishing a continuous diagnostic framework for the model with debug and healing processes; 2) Establish a cloud-based energy modeling workflow that can be deployed at various energy modeling tasks; and 3) equipping the system with the ability to process hourly and sub-hourly data and dynamically calibrate the energy performance of load-related systems. This work will lead to a total energy efficiency solution in a building\u2019s life cycle. With the developments completed in Phase I, the system will become a central data repository, which can self-manage the integrity of the model and keep the energy model up to date with the design changes or building operation updates. Therefore, at each stage in a building\u2019s life cycle, stakeholders can request and retrieve the model to conduct various analyses such as code compliance, measurement and verification, retrofit analysis and model-based building control. It helps designers and building owners to make rational decisions for their properties, saves energy and utility cost, and reduces the carbon footprint."

        "abstract": "The purpose of this proposal is to address an efficient and secure blockchain solution to facilitate renewable energy trading between Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) in the Solar PV energy market. Indiana Tool and Mfg. Co. (ITAMCO) is proposing to develop a cloud-based peer-to-peer blockchain transaction recording system for the emerging decentralized solar energy market. In phase I, the research will be restricted to showing feasibility of design and architecture of the proposed system. As renewable energy (e.g., solar energy) continues to make up a larger portion of our Nation\u2019s energy generation capacity, Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) as part of a transactive grid are an attractive, environmentally friendly, and cost- effective approach to meeting Demand Response (DR) needs of existing providers and holds the promise of a free and open electricity market for individual consumers. As compared to the top-down regulated structure in the traditional electricity market, participants in the transactive grid have the ability to control the trading of energy independently and as needed (on demand). Transactive grid advocates a network model for distributed nodes with a decentralized structure. The network supports the transactions among prosumers, users and energy stations with same equality. Blockchain is the mainstay of the network. Blockchain uses distributed ledgers where all participants on the chain keep a copy of the data. There is no intermediator between any two individuals and the activities (transactions) are totally anonymous and transparent. Blockchain resolves the trust problem between participants using sophisticated algorithms that verify a valid transaction should be recorded on the block. Traditional blockchain applications take a long time to verify transactions and users are required to download all records which consumes local storage. ITAMCO will design a new architecture for a blockchain transaction system in Phase 1 to overcome the current disadvantages in blockchain applications. The system will be implemented with Hyperledger Fabric, Quick UDP Internet Connections (QUIC) protocol and will utilize the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) for data storage. The team will design a simple prototype design built on Hyperledger Fabric in Phase 1 to show the feasibility and the high performance of the proposed blockchain transaction system. ITAMCO will partner with the Center for Research Computing at the University of Notre Dame who will provide necessary resources for the system development and will design the encryption mechanisms for user authentication, message passing and data storage. ITAMCO will collaborate with local power company (Marshall County REMC) to develop a strategy that can be used in the blockchain transaction system to balance load in the peak hours. Inovateus Solar LLC will provide the team with industry expertise and consulting in PV Solar system hardware (i.e. smart meters) and system integration with current and new PV Solar development projects."

        "abstract": "Accelerator magnets that are currently being used in high-energy physics experiments are limited to a maximum magnetic field of less than 20 T because superconductivity in the low- temperature superconductors from which the magnets are constructed breaks down at higher fields. The next generation of accelerator magnets needs to be made from high-temperature superconducting magnet cables. The requirement of operating these fragile materials at high current densities while experiencing high stresses makes this very challenging. This proposal seeks to develop high-temperature superconducting CORC\u00ae magnet wires that would have a current density of 600 A\/mm2 and a critical current of 10 \u2013 20 kA at 4.2 K and 20 T, and bendable to 30 mm diameter, which would enable the next generation of accelerator magnets that operate at 20 T and above. During Phase I of the program, we will develop the next generation of highly flexible CORC\u00ae wires from superconducting tapes with 25 \uf06dm thick substrates. We will ensure that the CORC\u00ae wires retain at least 80 % of the performance when bent to a diameter of less than 50 mm and have a current density of 400 A\/mm2 and critical current exceeding 5 kA at 20 T. During Phase II, the CORC\u00ae wire performance will be increased to 600 A\/mm2 with critical current exceeding 8 kA at 20 T by winding them from even thinner tapes with substrates as thin as 20 \uf06dm. At the same time, the flexibility of CORC\u00ae wires will be increased to allow bending to a diameter of 30 mm. Commercial applications and other benefits: High-temperature superconducting magnet wires that have a high current and high current density at 20 T, while being bendable to diameters less than 30 mm, will enable some of the next generation of high-energy physics magnets, proton cancer treatment facilities, practical fusion magnets, and scientific magnets. These magnets will also benefit superconducting magnetic energy storage systems for use in the power grid and within the Department of Defense."

        "abstract": "Excessive moisture transport into building enclosures can lead to increased energy use as well as mold growth and structural rot when moisture condenses in wall cavities. Currently, architects and builders must use passive membrane products as weather resistant barriers which exhibit a single permeability irrespective of environmental conditions. Membranes with a single high permeability may allow too much moisture ingression under hot and humid ambient conditions, while membranes with a single low permeability may not allow the building cavity to dry out when condensate accumulates. This project will demonstrate an electrostatically actuated, adaptive membrane for use as a weather resistant barrier. When temperature and relative humidity in the external environment is high as detected by sensors, the membrane exhibits low permeability to inhibit water vapor ingression into the building enclosure; but when humidity in the wall cavity is high, again detected by sensors, the membrane exhibits high permeability to allow water vapor egression to the outside. The membrane changes state by electrostatic actuation using a very low current electrical power supply. EA Membranes\u2019 electrostatically actuated membrane systems have been demonstrated previously in small scale applications including protective apparel for the military. Phase 1 of this project will demonstrate the technology at the scale needed for weather resistant barriers. In particular, 4\u2019 X 8\u2019 prototypes will be fabricated and the power supply needed to safely actuate them in this application will be developed. The prototypes and power supply will be functionally tested. An acceptable installation method will also be identified consistent with building industry methods. In addition, mathematical modeling will be completed using state-of-the-art hygrothermal modeling software to validate the utility of adaptive weather resistant barriers and to quantify the low and high permeability states needed for optimum results from the system in various climates."

        "abstract": "It is well known that a Low Temperature Plasma (LTP) can extend the operating envelope of flames, however scaling LTP systems has been identified as a challenge which has had limited technological advancement. Using LTP to enhance flame stability in industrial scale burners can lead to more robust operations while also providing a reduction in NOx emissions and increases in operating efficiencies. The major challenges to overcome for successful scaling and commercialization of the LTP system are: 1) maintaining LTP uniformity at scale, and 2) cheap, reliable power supplies. Scaling LTP plasma systems can be accomplished by incorporating pulsed power sources and utilizing a modular electrode design. The Phase 1 objective will result in a newly designed and tested flame stabilizing LTP module capable of generating a uniform plasma. This module will consist of a single porous ceramic tile containing an array of electrodes which are to be powered by a pulsed power source. Scaling the system will be possible by placing several modules side by side forming a flame stabilizing wall. Phase 1 work will begin with designing the LTP module which will integrate a porous ceramic flame holder with previously proved LTP systems capable of flame stabilization. Several pulsed power sources will be analyzed and acquired for testing appropriate plasma uniformity. The preliminary design will be fabricated and tested for plasma uniformity and flame stabilization at moderate temperatures. Lastly, high temperature tests will be carried out in a furnace to test the durability of materials and flame stabilizing capabilities at real world operating conditions. A fully scaled system can operate in industrial burner applications up to, and possibly greater than, 60 MBTU\/hr, providing a new ultra low NOx solution to the industry. When combustion occurs within porous ceramic tiles the NOx production can be as low as 5 ppm, however flame stabilization can sometime be an issue. Incorporating the additional flame stabilizing effects of LTP will increase the operating envelope of the ultra low NOx system making it more robust and reliable."

        "abstract": "Laser plasma accelerators (LPA) enabled by ultrafast laser (UFL) driver offers much reduced size and cost compared to conventional accelerators of the same energy. This would drastically cut the cost of high-energy particle research on collider-based facilities and advanced light sources. Planned conventional accelerators (e.g., for the proposed International Linear Collider) would be 25 miles long. LPA hold the promise of making possible a low-cost table-top accelerator with particle energies in the tens of GeV range. The development and engineering of these complex UFL systems for accelerator applications requires sophisticated computational design tools and predictive models. Because the various optical, thermal, and mechanical effects are highly coupled, fully integrated modeling tools employing a coupled multi-physics approach are required. The proposed project will create the urgently needed UFL simulation &amp; design model that will greatly expedite the development of the new and powerful UFL systems for a broad range of applications including laser acceleration, cancer therapy, material research &amp; production, precision manufacturing, and other emerging applications. In particular, the compactness and relative simplicity of the emerging field of laser accelerators promises to greatly reduce the cost and timelines of high-energy research, and to advance new scientific discoveries. With energetic particle beams affordable for universities, commercial laboratories (e.g., semiconductor material development), and hospitals (cancer therapy), the US will be able to maintain its technological leadership. The proposed project will leverage a suite of laser device\/system models that Aqwest previously developed for the US Army and US DOE, thus benefiting from previous US government investment and reducing the development cost and timeline. In Phase I, we will firm-up the modeling tool architecture, and start developing key elements by assimilating existing calibrated physics packages previously developed by Aqwest. In Phase II, we will complete the first releasable version of model and make it available to the Government, academia, and industry. 1-micron UFL based on ceramic Yb:Sc2O3 has major commercial applications in precision laser material processing, medical, remote sensing, lidar, and optical communication."

It will be driven by a high voltage (HV) switch currently under development at Fermilab. It is based on an array of field-effect switching transistors (FETs) operating at kV floating potentials and at as high as 30 MHz frequency. The transistors dissipate ~200 W\/cm2 power and need to be electrically insulated while the FET operating temperature is kept below 60\uf0b0C. In this project, RadiaBeam Systems will develop an effective cooling system without distortion of the nanosecond waveform that can be affected by presence of the HV cooling structure. The cooling system robustness and efficiency is enabled by a number of innovations: a) all- diamond heat spreader structure with vacuum-brazed fins; b) mini-channels enhancing heat transfer coefficient; b) expansion-matched holder for the spreader; c) low parasitic capacitance ("

Rechargeable lithium and lithium-ion batteries can fail violently when they are overheated, crushed, overcharged \/ over discharged or they are subjected to an internal electrical short. The violent nature of these failures is exacerbated by their highly flammable conventional liquid electrolyte solvents. The goal of this project is to develop a high-performance non-flammable lithium electrolyte based on the combination of a non-flammable ionic liquid solvent and a novel nanoporous solid polymer material. This project will develop an ionic liquid \u2013 nanoporous polymer hybrid electrolyte that will be far safer than conventional electrolytes, have a high conductivity, the ability to safely operate at extreme temperatures and that can be used with a lithium metal anode in a rechargeable battery for electric vehicles.

        "abstract": "Radio-frequency cavities are at the heart of particle accelerators used for nuclear and high-energy physics research, medical treatment, pollution control, clean energy production, development of new materials, and national security. The most advanced accelerators utilize cavities that are made from superconducting materials. However, the performance of these cavities is reaching a fundamental limit, and they are very expensive to fabricate and operate. Hence, next-generation accelerators require development of advanced cavities. One promising approach to greatly improving the performance and reducing cost is to coat the inner surfaces of these cavities with superconducting thin film materials having certain critical properties. Magnesium diboride is a superconductor that can meet these requirements. Depositing thin films of this compound is challenging, though an approach based on reactive evaporation has yielded superb results.We propose to develop equipment and methods that will advance the state-of-the-art of this thin- film coating technology and extend its capability in order to enable deposition of high-quality magnesium diboride thin films onto the inner surfaces of real-world elliptical superconducting radio-frequency cavities. During Phase I of this project we will produce and test simple three- dimensional cavity resonators coated with our material. We will also explore and model hardware designs and process methodologies to produce more complicated real-world resonators that have been developed for advanced accelerators.Successful deployment of this technology in a Phase II or Phase III project will result in the ability to produce the world\u2019s most advanced and cost-effective superconducting radio-frequency cavities in order to enable a host of beneficial applications outlined above."

TDA Research proposes to develop a smart hydrogen storage tank that incorporates novel cooling schemes to quickly dissipate\/absorb the heat of compression and keep the hydrogen gas temperature well below the hydrogen tank design temperature of 85\u00b0C with minimal impact on the cost, weight, volume, fill time, and well-to-power plant efficiency. TDA\u2019s design maximizes the heat transfer area and the heat transfer coefficients to quickly dissipate the heat throughout the refueling process. In the Phase I of the project, we will design and carry out sub-scale proof-of-concept tests of the smart tank design at the bench-scale to demonstrate that we can carry out re-fueling from any charge state and ambient temperature conditions, eliminating the precooling requirements at the station. We will also complete a preliminary design of the smart hydrogen storage tank for FCEVs and compare it against the DOE baseline 700 bar system."

        "abstract": "The overall objective of the project is to develop a process for the manufacture of conductive inks using U.S. coal as a primary feedstock. Minus 100 LLC, in collaboration with existing graphite manufacturers and ink formulators, will develop new or improved methods of manufacturing conductive ink products using coal as a primary feedstock. There are existing commercial markets for conductive inks ($2.3 billion in 2015) and the expected growth of these markets is significant (projected growth to $3.9 billion in 2021). The growth will primarily occur in existing and advanced printing methods to be used for electronic circuits, heating elements, Radio Frequency Identification (RIFD) tags, photovoltaic components, electronic displays, 3D printing and fluid\/plastic materials used to enhance the electrical\/thermal\/optical properties of the final printed material. A significant portion of the current conductive inks use elemental silver or silver compounds as a means of achieving high levels of conductivity. This expensive base material will be replaced with electrically conducting coal-based materials that are significantly lower in cost. It is estimated that the unit cost of these coal-based materials will be a least 50% less than silver-based conductive inks, thus providing a significant advantage to penetrate these markets. The current conductive ink applications have requirements of electrical resistivity ranging from (&lt; 1 ohm\/square) to about (100,000 ohm\/square). An example of a higher resistivity application is in the fabrication of automobile windshield heating assemblies that require a cured ink with a higher resistivity to allow heating of the printed electrical filaments. Because the ink markets are very fragmented, Minus 100 LLC will collaborate with existing ink formulators to develop the final ink formulations and to package\/distribute the final products for specific targeted applications. The highly conductive inks to be developed will use graphite or combinations of graphite and graphene as the primary component of the conductive ink particles. The commercial manufacturing of graphene is in its infancy and currently top-down, scalable manufacturing processes use graphite as a precursor material. Minus 100 will collaborate with existing graphite manufacturers to convert domestic coal sources to graphite\/graphene platelets that, in turn, can be used to produce highly conductive inks. During Phase I, Minus 100 will develop the coal-based processes, pigments and pastes to be used for the manufacture of a variety of conductive inks from a selected coal-based feedstock. Preliminary work at laboratory scale has verified the basic technical approaches to be used. Process flow diagrams will be developed for the individual process steps with the aim of a practical scale-up to commercial or demonstration scale operations. A bottoms-up cost analysis will be performed to validate the economics of the new\/improved manufacturing process using coal as the primary feedstock. During Phase II, a pilot scale assembly for critical process operations will be fabricated, and the procedures, compositions and formulations used for conductive ink manufacturing from coal-based feedstocks will be enhanced and improved upon. The manufacturing cost estimates developed under Phase I will be updated."

        "abstract": "Wind turbines provide an environmentally clean way of generating energy in ever more cost effective ways. Sites that that are classified as \u2018high class\u2019 generate power at lower costs than other generation alternatives. Unfortunately, the number of these sites is limited and lower costs and\/or higher outputs are needed for future sites to be cost effective. This is particularly true with the phased removal of the Production Tax Credit (PTC). LC Drives is proposing a way to significantly reduce the cost of wind power that will allow more sites to be cost effective, allowing significant growth in the amount of wind power generated. LC Drives will develop a medium-speed generator for utility scale wind that is less than half the size of the best medium-speed generators on the market today. This smaller generator will allow system advantages that will produce more power and will also cost less to produce. This change will significantly reduce the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) of wind, helping to meet the DOE\u2019s goal for wind power cost to be reduced. The smaller generator concept is based on patented and ongoing development efforts for technology that LC Drives has developed for marine propulsion applications. This technological breakthrough cools the motor windings more effectively thereby allowing both higher slot current density and increased torque in a given volume. The outcome of this approach is the ability to develop much smaller machines when compared to what would be state of the art liquid cooled machines currently available.The existing range of machines is 20 inches in diameter with powers configurable to over 2MW at 1500 rpm achieved by increasing stack length. Medium-speed wind generators require 3-10MW capacity at speeds in the range of 300-600 rpm. To achieve this increase in output requires scaling the 20- inch machine to 72 inches in diameter whilst maintaining a design that is scalable in stack length. Traditional thought processes state that medium-speed drivetrains are only advantageous for larger offshore wind applications, but the smaller generator technology proposed here allows lower cost wind systems down to 3 MW and therefore applicable to almost all onshore applications. For larger offshore applications the LCOE reduction is also significant. This generator approach will reduce the LCOE of wind by 3% due to increase in energy produced, lower production costs, and reduce maintenance. Lowering utility scale wind LCOE is clearly defined in topic 14b, Innovations in Utility-Scale Performance, but does not ask for drivetrain improvements because it is assumed that the savings would be minimal. The ability to make such a dramatic improvement in the weight of the generator opens up the opportunity to accomplish the 3% reduction. In this industry, even fractional % reductions in LCOE are considered significant with rare credible opportunities for savings over 1%.The proposed program will complete the detailed design of the 72 inch diameter machine and quantify the benefit for wind LCOE. A phase II program will build a MW scale prototype that will be able to be dynamometer tested in LC Drives world class facilities. LC Drives has a support letter from ABB that is the largest motor\/generator manufacturer in the world."

        "abstract": "Bandwidth demands are increasing for a wide variety of data communications systems and applications. Not only are these demands increasing to accommodate residential, commercial, space and defense data communication needs, but they are also increasing for the scientific community at various test centers and research institutions around the world. According to Topic 27d, \u201cHigh Energy Physics (HEP) experiments require advanced electronics and systems for the recording, processing, storage, distribution, and analysis of experimental data. Additionally, per Topic 28d, \u201cThe High Luminosity LHC detectors will require ultimate performance detector mechanical support and cooling, that holds detector elements with micron precision and stability, and yet adds as close to zero mass as possible. Developments in this area could also be applicable to other high-priority programs. After discussions and email transactions with HEP experts, two ideal applications for the ultra-long carbon nanotube material proposed have become readily evident: i) lower mass, lower density, higher thermal conductivity grounding\/shielding layers in low-mass, radiation-hard data transmission cables and ii) lower mass, lower density, higher thermal conductivity carbon nanotube reinforced carbon composite, fabric facing material to replace current carbon-fiber reinforced facing material as a primary cooling component in current and future HEP sensor systems. Both applications are relevant to current and future HEP experimentation needs and potentially provide significant improvements to current state-of-the-art associated with advanced materials for sensor cooling, radiation shielding and data transmission cable construction. And once the proposed synthesis process and catalyst configurations are refined and optimized for each application, the resulting material will provide increased thermal conductivity over current materials in use. The replacement of the solid aluminum shielding layer in ribbon cable prototypes with the novel material proposed will also significantly reduce the mass and density, while maintaining similar electrical conductivity, contributing to a significant increase in component and overall radiation length.Over the course of the proposed SBIR Phase 1 and planned Phase 2 project periods, two novel ultra-long carbon nanotube synthesis scenarios will be investigated and demonstrated to suit the applications of interest to DOE as summarized above. Nanomatronix and the Principal Investigator have been developing carbon nanotube synthesis, separation, deposition and alignment techniques since 2005. In order for a paradigm shift in structural and conductor materials to occur, synthesis processes capable of producing potentially limitless lengths of pure material that can be utilized in pure threads, fabrics, and mesh, for direct signal transmission line integration and composite material reinforcement, must be developed. And the candidate synthesis process should be multistaged, scalable and highly controllable such that ultra-long carbon nanotubes (&gt; 1m) can be synthesized in reasonable timeframes. Significant research has gone into combining many short (20nm \u2013 300nm long) carbon nanotube strands together to form \u2018CNT yarn\u2019. Unfortunately, up to 90% of the benefits of utilizing pure, continuous carbon nanotube molecules can be lost in the end-product due to the weaker interactions between the molecule walls of the short \u2018yarn\u2019 strands versus a continuous molecular run of pure carbon nanotube material. Both physical and electronic characteristics are significantly different between \u2018CNT yarn\u2019 versus pure, continuous molecular strands. Pure, continuous, ultra-long carbon nanotubes are needed in order to reap optimal industrial benefit and to reveal true benefits over current carbon fiber reinforced composites and \u2018CNT yarn\u2019 prototypes. Further and forconductor applications, the synthesis process must be able to selectively produce a high percentage of metallic carbon nanotubes. Conveniently, production costs for short strands (&lt; 300nm) is now at an all-time low (~$2\/gm for 70% single-wall as of 2016) providing further justification that production is maturing to the point that low-cost manufacturing is achievable. The next feasible step is the refinement and scale-up of ultra-long carbon nanotube production as proposed hereinHigh speed, low-mass shielding layers in EMI\/EMF immune RAD-hard data transmission cables for scientific research and defense-based data comm. needs. Alternate, game changingapplications such as CNT-reinforced composites, CNT-reinforced fabrics and textiles, etc. are also potential outcomes of the proposed R&amp;D."

        "abstract": "Accelerators are necessary for the fundamental study of matter and its origins. A critical component of accelerators are the niobium superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities, which are used to accelerate the particles. Because of the significant number of niobium SRF cavities required for each accelerator, innovative manufacturing techniques are needed to reduce fabrication costs and to ensure high quality cavities are produced. Recently, 3D Additive Manufacturing (AM) methods have been shown to reduce the cost and fabrication time of complex components using conventional metals such as aluminum, ferrous metals, nickel based superalloys, and titanium alloys. However, the high melting temperatures, sensitivity to interstitial impurities, and difficulty of obtaining suitable feedstock materials have limited the 3D printing of refractory metals and other exotic materials. Plasma Processes, a leader in the fabrication of near-net-shape refractory metal components, recently developed innovative Plasma Alloying and Spheroidization (PAS) techniques, which enable the production of high purity, spherical refractory metal powders. Building on its unique capabilities and expertise, Plasma Processes will use its PAS processing methods to produce exotic metal powders for 3D printing of accelerator cavities. During Phase I, niobium will used to baseline the PAS process. After producing the PAS niobium powders, Plasma Processes will partner with North Carolina State University, a leader in the development of AM processing methods, to produce 3D printed samples for preliminary characterization. During Phase II, Plasma Processes and NCSU will work together to 3D print SRF cavities from PAS niobium powder. In addition, the PAS and AM processing of materials with higher critical temperature than bulk niobium will also be evaluated during Phase II. The PAS and AM techniques to be developed during this effort will result in SRF cavities that enable the use of high performance accelerators. The size of the market for industrial accelerators is currently in the tens of thousands units worldwide, and it is likely to increase as more efficient, high performance accelerators are developed. In addition, the techniques will be used to produce high purity components for nuclear power generation, propulsion, chemical processing, corrosion protection, aerospace, liquid metal heat pipes, high temperature furnace components, and many other commercial, aerospace and government applications."

        "abstract": "Solar energy operators need real\u00adtime situational awareness and the insight of advanced analytics to compete in the energy marketplace. These benefits require increased connectivity, but the threat of distributed cyberattack on control systems is exacerbated by the limited number of vendors supplying millions of solar devices. Firewalls and software\u00adbased security are inherently vulnerable to attack, particularly in the age of botnets, unlimited computing power, and artificial intelligence. Secure equipment monitoring can be provided by data diodes (unidirectional gateways), but today\u2019s diodes require extensive on\u00adsite network configuration and can cost in excess of $100,000 per device. Fend will bring the unhackable, physically\u00adenforced security of data diodes to the solar equipment market through simpler, lower cost hardware capable of automatic configuration. Fend\u2019s Data Valve converts data into light for one\u00adway transmission, allowing for both equipment monitoring and complete isolation from cyberattack. Fend\u2019s will reduce costs by up to 99% with plug\u00adand\u00adplay hardware that can be installed by anyone trusted to service solar equipment. Fend\u2019s optional cloud\u00adbased analytics platform allows for real\u00adtime equipment monitoring and predictive analytics to reduce unexpected equipment downtime. Fend provides the fastest and most cost effective way to secure new solar installations and protect gigawatts of existing capacity.Objectives for Phase I are: (1) Significantly reduce costs of data diode protection through right\u00adsizing of componentry for the solar energy market; (2) Enable automatic, plug\u00adand\u00adplay installation by technicians and remove the need for manual network configuration by network engineers; and (3) Make real\u00adtime grid state monitoring and data analytics more accessible to solar generation operators. Though this Phase I SBIR project, Fend will adapt its technology for the solar energy market by refining the hardware design and expanding the capabilities of the Data Valve\u2019s on\u00adboard software. The result of Phase I will be a device that can automatically connect to one type of solar energy equipment and transmit data to the desired network location while completely protecting that equipment from malicious network traffic. Through Phase II and beyond, automatic protocol switching will allow the Data Valve to serve multiple equipment types and expansion into the protection of fossil energy and nuclear plants, critical building systems, and water utilities. Commercial success provides these benefits: (1) Enhanced security for the US electric industry; (2) Improved grid resilience through secure, real\u00adtime availability of equipment status; (3) Increased operational efficiency through operational awareness and early fault detection; and (4) US\u00adbased manufacturing and software development jobs."

        "abstract": "To make a viable tokamak reactor concept, efficient, robust steady state current drive is required. RF power is among the leading contenders due to its high efficiency and penetration to the plasma core without density limits. To minimize impact on tritium breeding, high power density RF antennas are desired. At present, electrical breakdown limits the power density to ~10 MW\/m2. Recent results at MIT utilizing an Inconel based field aligned ICRF antenna showed significantly increased load tolerance, reduced impurity contamination, and reduced RF enhanced heat flux associated with ICRF antenna operation compared to standard ICRF antennas. However, a field-aligned antenna results in a smaller antenna area compared to a standard antenna due to geometrical constraints. To increase the power density, a field-aligned antenna must have a higher voltage and power limit. Emerging experimental results suggest that materials with higher tolerance to surface fatigue and melting temperature lead to higher breakdown limits. The ability to produce high density, well-bonded refractory metal coatings on Inconel based substrates has recently been demonstrated by Plasma Processes using electroforming (EL-Form) techniques and testing at MIT has confirmed improved breakdown resistance. In addition, the ability to additively manufacture (AM) an ICRF antenna will enable the development of more complex antenna designs that could lead to further improved electrical performance. Therefore, during this investigation, an advanced field-aligned ICRF antenna will be developed by combining additive manufacturing techniques to produce an antenna with complex features such as internal cooling channels and the deposition of innovative EL-Form refractory metal coatings to improve breakdown resistance."

        "abstract": "Computers based on quantum-mechanical phenomena, if realized, could disrupt many computationally intense fields of science, including high-energy physics. One of the greatest challenges in building a quantum computer is improving the coherence of quantum states. High quality factor superconducting RF (SRF) resonators coupled to Josephson junctions are one of the most promising solutions. However, their designs are currently optimized for particle acceleration rather than hosting qubits. In response to this problem, we propose to develop an SRF cavity for quantum computers based on a quarter-wave resonator (QWR) with optimized shape, operating in the 6-10 GHz frequency region. A QWR is an attractive choice for the simplicity of its integration with the Josephson junction, which can be placed near the central conductor to allow higher coupling strength, and the feasibility of scaling it to multi-qubit system. In Phase I, we will optimize the shape of the proposed cavity and perform engineering and fabrication studies for the niobium prototype. In Phase II we will machine a cell out of niobium and perform cryogenic tests at Fermilab to demonstrate the required Quality-factors. We will investigate an aluminum resonator, for which we will have to develop cleaning, etching, and polishing techniques.The emerging discipline of quantum computing, although presently in its infancy, is rapidly growing and has an explosive commercial potential. Upon successful completion of the Phase II work, RadiaBeam would be in an excellent position to establish its presence as a supplier of components for this growing field by leveraging the SRF technology developed in this project."

        "abstract": "Future plasma accelerators for high-energy physics or industrial applications will need to efficiently transfer energy from the driver into the witness bunch. Beam break-up instabilities may prevent this, but those models are based on assumptions that treat the plasma bubble as a conducting beam pipe, which must be validated. Using advanced algorithms for modeling plasmas, we will adapt the wake field model to plasma accelerators and determine if and where the model remains valid. We will also work to mitigate remaining wake or wake-like instabilities to allow plasma accelerators to be operated efficiently.During Phase I, we will determine if these advanced plasma modeling algorithms can correctly capture the conventional picture of wake fields in plasma systems, and then use the benchmarked tools to calculate the wake fields in a plasma accelerator. We will then determine when the standard wake field picture applies, and how it breaks down. This will inform Phase II work to mitigate any remaining instabilities and enable high-efficiency plasma accelerators. Efficiency is important for many plasma accelerator applications, including as bright X-ray sources for national security or drivers for TeV colliders or extremely compact free-electron lasers. The developments from this project will allow those applications to operate at significantly reduced power cost."

        "abstract": "Advanced beam diagnostics are essential for reliable operation of high-performance accelerators and the intense beams produced by them. Non-invasive diagnostics can be used continuously with intense beams, while invasive techniques interfere with the beams and distort the beam profiles. In addition, traditional solid-based beam monitoring instrumentation produces unacceptable levels of radiation operating in high power beam environments. Noninvasive determination of accelerated particle distributions and profiles is the most difficult task of bunch diagnostics. Muons, Inc. proposes to develop non-interfering residual-gas beam profile monitors for transfer lines with pulse-to-pulse precision of better than 0.1 mm in position and size that will operate over a wide range of proton beam intensities including those needed for multi- MW beams of future facilities. Our innovative approach is to develop a low mass residual-gas profile monitor, where beam induced fluorescence will be used to monitor the beam profile. An original scheme of light collection using a mirascope, an optical device invented in the 16th century, is proposed. The gas composition and pressure in the beam pipe are locally controlled to minimize unwanted radiation and to improve resolution. In Phase I we will simulate the operation of the profile monitor. The mirascope light collection system will be designed. Light intensifier will be ordered and adapted for a profile monitor. The fabrication and testing of an industrial strength version of the profile monitor will be done in Phase II. COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS AND OTHER BENEFITS: This advanced universal low cost residual-gas profile monitor can replace all other profile monitors used in high power accelerators used for discovery science as well as those used for future industrial applications such as Accelerator-driven Subcritical Reactors, Muon Beam Tomography and for homeland security applications."

        "abstract": "An important challenge electric utilities will face in the foreseeable future is a workforce that is rapidly retiring and the resulting loss of institutional knowledge. This will also create a vulnerability in the electric grid, especially during widespread power outages where recovery efforts rely on a team of well-trained and experienced personnel. Disasters like Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico highlight how brittle infrastructure can be, as well as the strong dependency on knowledgeable workforce to successfully recuperate. The recovery time for this particular case is far from acceptable. During these critical situations, even if we had unlimited budget, it would be wastefully inefficient to have the small number of available experts physically travel to several locations to support recovery. We propose a Virtual Reality (VR) remote collaboration system to enable technicians in the field to summon an expert by opening a sort of &quot;wormhole&quot; that connects two disparate physical locations into a shared virtual environment where both expert and novice technicians can collaborate and provide guidance and instructions on the task at hand - like being next to each other, side by side. The project aims to develop a software prototype for the underlying VR environment and the required user interface for the relevant use cases, while leveraging commercially available hardware and software, like photogrammetry, 3D scanners and immersive VR displays and input devices. Our solution will enable a small number of experienced-personnel to guide, train and supervise the electric utility workforce of the future. It will allow one person to remotely guide and instruct multiple technicians and crews across widespread locations by virtually moving from one remote location to another in a matter of seconds, maximizing their ability to contribute in disaster recovery efforts, etc."

As a result, we can make a near 100% fill factor diode with a thick absorption region up to 400 \u03bcm suitable for direct detection of radiation. In phase II, we will design and fabricate a monolithic CMOS large area direct radiation detector based on an array of the avalanche detector pixels developed in phase I. This detector will consist of an array of optically isolated avalanche detector pixels with in-pixel digitization, bias, and quenching circuitry and an appropriate readout circuit. This near 100% fill factor pixel array will be suitable for direct radiation detection. While the imager is intended for direct radiation detection, it will also be extremely sensitive to broadband visible light (ultraviolet to near infrared). There are a range of commercial applications that stands to benefit from this high sensitivity broadband image sensor. \u2022 LIDAR &amp; range detection - low cost solution for self-driving cars ; \u2022 Night vision \u2013 low cost replacement for the microchannel plate tube technology ; \u2022 Security cameras \u2013 eliminating or reducing the illumination needed to detect activity ; \u2022 Machine vision \u2013 high speed low light imaging for various purposes ; \u2022 Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM) ; \u2022 Optical tomography ; \u2022 Fiber optic communication"

        "abstract": "The Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland is the largest particle accelerator in the world. An upgrade bringing higher resolution (higher luminosity) is called HL-LHC and will require improved lightweight materials. Thermal interface materials having higher thermal conductivity (&gt; 4 W\/mK) with low atomic mass and excellent radiation-resistance are required to achieve tight tolerances on detectors. A nanostructured carbon system is combined with a polymer such that the composite is flexible and can provide efficient infrared heating. The electrical and thermal properties can be controlled by the size, shape, loading, and selection of nanostructured carbon. This compliant thermal interface material has room-temperature thermal conductivities in the x-y plane of 5-11 W\/mK range and densities between 0.7-1.3 g\/cc. Adhesion is presently possible through solvation of the polymer binder. The system is primarily composed of carbon and hydrogen, with limited amounts of oxygen and nitrogen. The objective of the Phase I effort is to make a microstructure with nearly isotropic thermal conduction in excess of 4 W\/mK using a polymer system that retains flexibility while leading to improved adhesion and high radiation- resistance. Radiation exposure and subsequent testing will determine if this new material is superior in performance compared to epoxy-based thermal interface materials presently in use. The Phase II work will produce large-scale (up to one meter in diameter) thermal interface materials with adhesive strengths in excess of one MPa and thermal conductivity &gt; 10 W\/mK in the through-thickness direction to meet specific needs within the High-Luminostiy, Large Hadron Collider. Thermal interface materials with higher thermal conductivities can be used for dissipating heat from a wide range of electronic devices. These materials also have the ability to shield electromagnetic interference and can be used as infrared heaters for a variety of applications. Filled-polymers with enhanced thermal conductivities and electrically conductivity can be molded, extruded, or cast to produce new grades for more demanding applications."

        "abstract": "Engineered platforms using mixed microbial consortia to consolidate multiple reaction steps and perform disparate conversions simultaneously can substantially enhance the carbon efficiency of biomass conversion processes and lower the biofuel cost to an economically competitive level. In this project, an integrated process will be developed to produce n-butanol from cellulosic biomass and waste gas streams using two engineered clostridial strains, one butanol-tolerant solventogenic strain and one carboxydotrophic acetogen, co-immobilized in a \u201cLinear Immobilized Bioreactor\u201d (LIBR). The CO2 and H2 produced by the solventogenic strain will be used by the carboxydotrophic strain to produce acetate (and butyrate) that in turns can be used by the solventogenic strain to produce more butanol. Such a co- cultured fermentation has the potential to increase butanol production from biomass hydrolysate sugars by up to 50% with 100% reduction in CO2 emission. Butanol produced in the fermentation will be stripped by the rising bubbles of fermentation produced gases (CO2 and H2) in the LIBR and separated via a condenser, alleviating butanol inhibition while achieving continuous butanol production at a high productivity and product titer, which can reduce both water and energy consumptions by over 50% compared to conventional ethanol and ABE fermentation processes. Phase I study will prove the new bioprocess concept and verify our hypothesis that the proposed LIBR and co-cultured fermentation can enhance the conversion of lignocellulosic sugars to butanol with higher butanol yield, productivity and titer, leading to reduced biobutanol cost to compete more favorably with bioethanol and fossil fuels. A prototype lab-scale LIBR for multiphase fermentation will be constructed to investigate and demonstrate the technical feasibility and advantages of the LIBR for multiphase fermentation involving sugars and gaseous substrates. The LIBR will be optimized and evaluated for its economic feasibility for biobutanol production from lignocellulosic biomass and industrial waste gases in Phase II."

        "abstract": "There is substantial interest in the upgrading the existing High Energy Physics accelerators to higher energy levels so as to probe deeper into the subatomic scale and unlock the mysteries of the Universe. Such upgrades to higher energy levels would require use of High Temperature Superconductor (HTS) magnets which can generate magnetic fields levels of 20 T and beyond. Canted Cosine Theta (CCT) beam steering magnets using a smaller bend radius winding configuration is a leading design to generate multipole magnetic fields. A promising HTS candidate for use in accelerator magnets is RE-Ba-Cu-O (REBCO, RE=rare earth) coated conductors that are fabricated by a reel-to-reel thin film process. A challenge with REBCO coated conductors is their flat rather than a round geometry which makes it difficult to use them in accelerator magnets of complex shapes. Recently, we developed an innovative approach to fabricate round REBCO wires of 1.6 to 1.85 mm diameter using ultra-thin REBCO tapes where the superconductor film is positioned near the geometric center. Such Symmetric Tape Round (STAR) wires exhibit excellent tolerance to bend strain with a critical current retention of more than 97% when bent to a radius of 15 mm and an engineering current density (Je) of 406 A\/mm2 at 4.2 K in a background field of 20 T. In the proposed program, AMPeers LLC will work to develop consistent and high performance STAR REBCO wires specifically for prototype CCT coils that require a minimum bending radius of 15 mm to be operated at 20 T. Various STAR REBCO wire geometries will be fabricated in lengths of few meters and optimized based on the electromagnetic and mechanical properties of these wires and the performance after being wound into the CCT structures. The optimal STAR REBCO wire geometry will be scaled up during the Phase II SBIR program to support the development of prototype CCT magnets. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: In addition to meeting the needs of High Energy Accelerators that would operate at 20 T and beyond for High Energy Physics, the new technology would be highly impactful in the commercial market for accelerators which includes proton beam therapy in medicine, ion implantation for digital electronics, for safer use of nuclear energy, treatment of water and flue gases, pharmaceutical drug development and nuclear forensics and cargo screening for security. Additionally, the round REBCO wire technology developed in this program can enable commercialization of HTS in power applications such as generators, motors and transformers."

        "abstract": "There is a need for compact and light-weight radiation detectors that can be mounted on drone technologies to perform remote and\/or geo-mapping. Remotely-controlled systems have a proven record of entering dangerous environments in support of search-and-rescue or similar operations. These environments may instead contain sources of radiation; yet, few attempts have been made to incorporate radiation detection capabilities into these systems. The proposed modular radiological survey imaging system (MRSIS) can potentially fill this need. The MRSIS coupled to a drone could be used for routine maintenance checks of nuclear facilities, military operations, and source search scans, including efforts to monitor residual radiological contamination at important sites (Hanford). In addition, the MRSIS\u2019s designed modularity will permit a single system to adapt to many unique or changing situations. The MRSIS will leverage previously developed next-generation radiation detection technologies, that are compact, light-weight, low-power. The COTS neutron and gamma-ray sensors will be packaged in a configurable system, paired with GPS and reach-back communication electronics. The MRSIS will be developed to serve as both standalone units and as part of a mesh network of multiple detector units. The MRSIS can be distributed around an area of suspected contamination (via drone, personnel, or air-drop) where they can record their findings along with a synchronized timestamp and GPS location and either report measured radiation levels in real-time or record and store them for later retrieval. The MRSIS can also be worn and\/or held by an operator in order to provide ground-level walkabout mapping of radiation levels. Should an ultra-wide-area survey be required, the MRSIS can be mounted to a remotely-operated drone to provide a rapid survey of a radiologically-contaminated area. The low-cost, long single-charge operational lifetime radiological monitors are suited for use in applications that require geo-tagging (through GPS and motion sensors), data- logging, and long-range reach back (through integrated GSM or similar radios). Real-time, wide-area 2D mapping information will provide a safety level not presently achievable by contemporary radiation monitors and survey methods."

        "abstract": "Although cellulosic nanomaterials have shown the potential for advancing a multitude of bio-based products, the production and dewatering of these materials is a costly, energy-intensive, multi-step process. Cellulose nanofibrils and nanocrystals are extremely hydrophilic; combined with their high surface area this makes dewatering the gel-like suspensions of these nanomaterials very difficult. TDA Research proposes to develop a new separation process that can reduce the cost and energy requirements of producing cellulosic nanomaterials. The key to our process is a new separator that can combine multiple unit operations of the current manufacturing process into a single step to carry out bulk dewatering of the cellulosic nanomaterial suspensions. The process intensification by combining separate unit operations such as defibrillation and multi-step dewatering into a single piece of equipment increases the energy efficiency and reduces the capital costs. In Phase I, we will design and fabricate a bench-scale system to demonstrate the key aspects of the new separation concept. We will extensively characterize the recovered products, assessing their physical properties and chemical characteristics to ensure that the proposed dewatering process does not alter their useful material properties. We will extensively use computational fluid dynamics simulations in the experimental effort and to aid the preliminary design of a commercial system. We will estimate system cost and the cost of the overall process."

        "abstract": "There is a growing \u201cmacroscopic\u201d interest towards fundamentally quantum \u201cmicroscopic\u201d processes, such as in the emerging areas of quantum communications, quantum computing or non- invasive quantum measurements. A single electron orbiting around the ring and emitting single quanta at the rate of about one event per hundred turns could produce a wealth of information about quantum processes. Hence, there is an interest in revisiting experimentally the problem of a single electron stored in a storage ring \u201ctrap\u201d and use state of the art diagnostic equipment to characterize radiation properties in such system. To respond to this challenge, RadiaBeam proposes to utilize Integrable Optics Test Area (IOTA) storage ring presently under construction at Fermilab, which is both available, and ideal in size and properties for single electron studies. We plan to produce a 1.5-meter insertion device to install at the IOTA ring, designed to produce undulator radiation in a visible range, and develop a downstream single photon sensitive diagnostic system which would enable high precision temporal, spectral, spatial and angular characterization of the single electron radiation properties. In Phase I we plan to develop a detailed scientific program for the single electron studies at the IOTA ring, and also optimize and engineer the insertion wiggler. SEED diagnostic system components will be specified, and the layout modeled, in preparation for the Phase II experimental program.Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: Besides the strong scientific case, and educational value, the proposed SEED program overlaps with three important technological thrusts, with a significant commercialization potential: exploration of new methodologies in manipulating quantum systems (i.e. for quantum cryptography); a development and optimization of ultra-sensitive diagnostic instrumentation and low intensity \u201cstandard candle\u201d calibration sources; and, improvements to accelerators themselves."

        "abstract": "Dry cooling systems are the only option for industrial and utility power plants that are unable to obtain cooling water supplies or permits, and can be applied to both nuclear- and fossil-fueled plants. Available dry cooling systems are less efficient than wet systems, so significant improvements in efficiency are needed to make them economically viable. Previous attempts at using foam as a cooling fin material for power generating systems have focused on high thermal conductivity graphite foams, but because those materials had very high pressure drops and hence low permeability with respect to air flow, their internal volume and surface area were not effectively used and they performed poorly.A more open foam would increase the permeability, greatly enhance air flow through the bulk material, increase the rate of heat transfer, and enable the material to outperform traditional fin structures. In recent work for DOE, Ultramet developed high-performance, air-cooled graphite foam heat exchangers for use in conventional power plants located in desert environments where cooling water is not available. Whereas graphite foams made via conventional processes have high densities and high pressure drops, graphite foams made by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) have pressure drops that are orders of magnitude lower. This enables the cooling air to permeate the entire foam volume, thus taking full advantage of its high internal surface area for heat transfer. Various foam architectures have been developed and tested, and at an air-side pressure drop of 1 in H2O, the heat transfer rate is nearly four times greater than that of high-performance aluminum fins.The heat transfer and pressure drop models developed in previous work at Ultramet will be used to develop foam architectures specifically for use in a Brayton power cycle system. A flow sheet will be developed, the heat exchanger duty and operating conditions will be quantified, foam architectures will be developed specifically for those conditions, and a series of subscale heat exchanger cores using those architectures will be tested. The resulting data will be used to refine the models (if necessary) and to scale up the heat exchanger design.Commercial applications and other benefits: Large-scale commercial applications include industrial and utility power plants (both nuclear and fossil fuel), petrochemical refineries, and chemical process installations. Smaller applications include heat exchangers used by the military in desert environments (e.g. air conditioners, environmental control units, heat exchangers for radars)."

        "abstract": "Fundamental improvements to the energy, brightness, and stability of lepton beams from next generation plasma-based accelerators are essential to maintain rapid innovation and scientific productivity within the field of advanced accelerators. Meeting these goals will require improvements in the understanding, design, and control of the plasmas used for both injection and acceleration. Laser plasma accelerators benefit from shaped densities that match the beam distribution and permit diffraction-free propagation, while beam-driven wakefield accelerators for positrons require near-hollow channel profiles. Capillary discharge technology promise tailored profiles for both types of sources, as well for lenses necessary for coupled acceleration. However, improved modeling tools are required to advance the technology.We propose to simulate capillary discharge plasmas using the publicly available multiphysics code FLASH. We will develop the tools to optimize plasma density for matching and guiding of drive beams and intense lasers, as well as the inclusion of embedded gas jets for downramp injection. We will also demonstrate their viability in generating hollow-channel plasmas for positron wakefield acceleration and other advanced concepts. We will facilitate easy exchange of data between FLASH and community PIC codes for simulating laser-plasma accelerators, with the goal of permitting self-consistent start-to-end simulations of plasma accelerators. We will simulate a capillary discharge waveguide with FLASH in 2D and R-Z geometries and benchmark against previous work. We will individually parametrize radial and longitudinal profiles as a function of capillary conditions. We will demonstrate the capability to optimize these targets, as necessary for generating profiles such as a hollow channel. We will implement a prototype GUI for simulations of capillary discharge plasmas, based on our open source Sirepo architecture. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: We will commercialize our open-source scientific application framework Sirepo to provide sophisticated simulation support and consulting services for targeted industry and research partners. The Sirepo platform is designed to support a diverse array of software for modelling hydrodynamics, plasma physics, beam physics, and nanoscale device multi physics. Our target customers are businesses interested in computation fluid dynamics simulations, which have industrial applications in automotive, aerospace, defense, and energy markets. In addition to direct sales and presentations at conferences and trade shows, Radia Soft will build and brand an active online community and a viable ecosystem to support this business model."

        "abstract": "As a result of changes in regulations and permitting, the use of water for cooling in nuclear and other utility power plants is being constrained. Dry Coolers have larger footprints and costs, which burdens ratepayers, but achieves the objective of little to no water use. Due to of steam characteristics, Rankine steam cycle power plants have significant cost challenges, when converting to dry cooling. In contrast, the special characteristics of Supercritical Carbon Dioxide Recompression Brayton Cycles results in smaller, lighter and less costly dry coolers. However, costs must be further reduced, to take full advantage of the advanced cycle for nuclear and other power plants.An advanced air side heat exchanger fin has been defined that increases heat transfer by 170%, and reduces size and weight by 63%. This results in a dry cooler capital cost reduction of 46%, and total cost reduction of 48%, in a modular package that minimizes site erection costs, versus conventional dry coolers. These benefits are achieved by a special enhanced heat transfer fin that also has high efficiency, versus conventional fins.Under the proposed project, the special enhanced heat transfer fin will be adapted to the supercritical carbon dioxide cooler application. Available analysis tools will be used to design a full scale cooler system, for nuclear power systems of interest. Based on the full scale design, a subscale test article will be designed, fabricated and tested, using available test support equipment. The test data and analysis will then be used to update the full scale design, and evaluate the technical and economic feasibility of the cooler concept. This will prepare the concept for development and testing, under a Phase II effort, to prove system performance and economic benefits, using prototype equipment. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: The market for the concept is the same as the replacement market for all steam based Rankine power plants by supercritical carbon dioxide cycles that will have over 25 percent higher efficiency, smaller footprint, and be able to use dry cooling that will save many millions of gallons of water. The cooler concept alone can save $3 billion in capital cost for all power plants, relative to conventional filtration."

        "abstract": "Cost-effective, high temperature and corrosion resistant heat exchangers are a key enabling component for next generation nuclear power systems. In support of the DOE\u2019s goals to develop advanced technologies for energy conversion systems, Clean Energy Systems, Inc. (CES) proposes the development and demonstration of a new and novel heat exchanger (HX) that offers the promise of meeting identified targets while overcoming many of the shortcomings of traditional HXs. The proposed work seeks to develop a key component of advanced nuclear power plants, the high- temperature molten salt heat exchanger. The novel approach offers a robust, cost effective solution with attributes that include: (1) Extreme compactness and high thermal effectiveness, (2) High pressure integrity, with both primary and secondary containment, (3) Ability to segregate and contain exchanger fluids in a dedicated and minimized volume of material appropriate to the fluid contained, (4) Use of proven, environmentally favorable, manufacturing processes and materials, (5) Shorter fabrication and lead times than currently employed heat exchanger technologies, (6) Significantly lower cost than currently employed heat exchanger technologies. The two phase research development and demonstration program will design, fabricate, evaluate, and iterate small-scale test units in order to develop the tools and processes necessary for commercial deployment of the heat exchangers. Phase I will evaluate multiple prototypes using various materials such stainless steel and high nickel alloys and is anticipated to advance the technology to readiness level 4. Based on the results of Phase I, Phase II will scale up selected designs and conduct prototype testing in simulated commercial environments. This second Phase is anticipated to advance the technology to readiness level 6. While the technology development targets advance nuclear power, there are numerous applications of the resulting low-cost heat exchanger; such as advanced solar power or the high-pressure hydrogen economy. As such, the work supports a shift toward a low carbon energy future, reduces reliance on fossil fuels, and ensures America\u2019s energy security."

        "abstract": "Cost and size reductions are needed in the electric traction drive system currently used for electric drive vehicles (EDV) to make them cost and performance competitive with fossil fuel vehicles. Such cost parity is critical to achieving public acceptance and expanded market share of EDV products. To achieve cost and size parity, the DoE\u2019s Electrical and Electronics Technical Team has established 2025 technical targets, which include $3.3\/kW and 50kW\/L for the electric traction motor. Interior permanent magnet (IPM) synchronous motors have proven a popular choice for the traction motor in current EDVs due to their high torque and power density, high efficiency, simple construction, easy control, and field weakening ability for constant power operation.However, the rare-earth magnets used in these motors are costly, accounting for 20% to 30% of the total motor cost.Furthermore, as China is the primary supplier of the rare-earth materials used in these magnets, they are susceptible to supply constraints and cost volatility.Therefore, the DoE is seeking a motor solution that can meet stringent 2025 cost and power density targets without the use of rare-earth materials. Proposed for this application is a novel, axial gap, IPM motor design that uses low cost Alnico magnets. This design possesses a number of attractive features that make it a promising candidate for meeting 2025 targets. First, it uses a single stator, dual-rotor topology that makes efficient use of active materials (i.e. magnetic core and windings) while minimizing non-active components for lower cost and higher power- density. Second, it uses a unique wave winding that provides low copper losses, excellent cooling, and a large magnetic air gap for further power-density enhancement. Third, it employs an advanced rotor design expected to provide high air-gap flux densities while avoiding demagnetization of the Alnico magnets. This structure should also enable efficient constant power operation over a wide speed range, desirable for an economical power converter. The Phase I effort will explore several design variations and choose the most promising to optimize. This design will be optimized and evaluated relative to its ability to meet 2025 cost and power density targets. Assuming feasibility is confirmed, Phase II will construct and test a working prototype system and validate performance expectations. Commercialization of the technology will be pursued following successful validation."

        "abstract": "The electricity produced from fossil fuels is essential to the world\u2019s prosperity and security, but the increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations caused by the fossil fuel combustion are implicated in global warming. Although there are several methods for separating CO2 from the flue gases, all of them have significant drawbacks, including loss of efficiency and increased capital and operating costs that dramatically increase the cost of electricity. TDA Research, Inc. (TDA) proposes to develop a new class of sorbents to remove CO2 selectively and with high capacity from the flue gases generated from pulverized-coal combustion power plants. The new adsorbent will tolerate moisture and work effectively at a wide range of CO2 concentrations. In Phase I we will prepare various sorbent formulations and screen them to determine their capacity to adsorb CO2 under representative conditions. Based on the performance results, we will carry out a preliminary design of our CO2 capture system, estimate its size and cost, and carry out an engineering assessment to compare it to alternative processes."

        "abstract": "Uranium Dioxide (UO2) has long been the workhorse of the nuclear power industry. Manufacturing methods are well established and build upon well-known processing technologies such as metallurgy and powder sintering.As the Department of Energy, Office of Nuclear Energy, as well as industry, strive to achieve safer, higher efficiency fuels, new fuel formulations rise to prominence; for example Uranium Silicide (U3Si2) and Uranium Nitride (UN). Other, refractory fuels such as Uranium Carbide and intermetallic carbides, such as Uranium-Tungsten Carbide are also gaining interest for high-temperature nuclear applications. Advances in manufacturing and processing of such alternate fuel are regarded as important contributions towards improving fuel efficiency and accident tolerance while also extending the life of the fleet of extent nuclear power plants.Contrary to UO2, however, there are no well-established manufacturing processes for the proposed alternative nuclear fuel materials. This is where Free Form Fibers\u2019 expertise in Material-Agnostic Additive Manufacturing can contribute significant advances. Rather than relying on ad-hoc metallurgy, Free Form Fibers\u2019 unique approach is positioned to allow for low-cost synthesis of a wide range of refractory fuels directly from the gas phase. This direct conversion process eliminates onerous chemistry and powder metallurgy processes and can deliver material purities and compositions that rival with the microelectronics industry without the typical costs associated to chip fabrication."

        "abstract": "To realize the immense opportunity for energy savings from retrofitting existing residential buildings, and to develop a self-sustaining energy efficiency marketplace, accurate data about energy efficiency opportunities needs to be made available at a large scale to all market actors and decision makers. But identifying cost-effective energy efficiency measures for individual homes, or for groups of homes, can be a formidable and expensive task. Energy efficiency programs have traditionally relied on detailed on-site energy audits, building energy modeling, and data analytics, but that approach cannot be scaled quickly and effectively. Alternatively, crude assumptions can be made based on home age and location for targeting, but that does not provide sufficient analytical rigor. We propose a hybrid solution which addresses the limitations, and draws on the strengths, of each approach. Building upon recent advances in data science, machine learning and cloud computing with EnergyPlus\u2122 and OpenStudio\u00ae, and combining them with automated data acquisition of non-traditional sources, we propose to build a new targeting tool called XeroHome\u2120. XeroHome\u2120 will be a building energy modeling and data analytics-based tool designed to generate energy efficiency recommendations for homes quickly, accurately, and at scale. XeroHome\u2120 will provide a platform to provide un-biased energy upgrade recommendations for homeowners, and a channel for finding and engaging with potential program participants and customers for energy efficiency programs, and technology &amp; service vendors in the home performance industry. Under Phase 1 Vistar Energy will develop a fully-functioning pilot-scale prototype of the XeroHome\u2120 tool. Working with one of our partner utilities, we will identify 100-500 test homes and use the XeroHome\u2120 prototype to identify energy upgrade opportunities."

        "abstract": "The proliferation of nuclear weapons presents unparalleled danger. Critical to preventing the spread of such weapons of mass destruction is the detection and characterization of both the production and movement of special nuclear materials. Neutron interrogation techniques, including Associated Particle Imaging (API), are valuable tools in the nonproliferation effort, but the limited capability of portable neutron systems tightly constrains their application. Advancements in the versatility, performance and portability of neutron generators, and API generators in particular, are needed. Adelphi is leveraging recent advances in its neutron generator technology along with low-cost semiconductor alpha detectors developed at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center to produce a revolutionary, hand-portable API neutron imaging system. With the advent of its solid-state microwave driven electron-cyclotron-resonance ion source, Adelphi is able to reduce the size and weight of its API neutron generators to less than 8 liters and 30 pounds, requiring only 200 watts of input power or less. Furthermore, taking advantage of the precision tuning of the solid-state microwave drive, the neutron output can be adjusted over two orders of magnitude, allowing the generator to be used for both single particle counting elemental analysis, which requires a low intensity, and projection imaging, which requires a high intensity. SLAC\u2019s semiconductor detectors provide a rugged, very low-cost solution to provide the spatial resolution necessary for an API system. Subcomponents and capabilities of the system will be demonstrated in Phase I, including the output variability, neutron production target, and alpha detector, resulting in the design of the full system to be built in Phase II"

        "abstract": "Wellbore integrity is of critical importance for ensuring efficient well operations as well as human health and environmental safety. An increasing numbers of wells are being drilled in areas of large populations that rely on subsurface sources of drinking water. The ability to assess well integrity would further reduce the risk of aquifer contamination due to inadequate cement jobs. A cost-effective method of determining cement condition would ensure improved efficiency in addition to increased levels of safety. Furthermore, increased knowledge of cement condition will help to better guide well construction and operation. However, current techniques for well cement evaluation often yield ambiguous or inaccurate results. Oceanit has developed a unique acoustically responsive well cement that allows enhanced determination of cement location, integrity, and stress. The new well isolation material provides unique identification of the location of well cements through enhanced acoustic impedance, even in lightweight and foam formulations. It allows improved detection of voids at the cement-formation barrier as well as the casing- cement interface. The smart cement utilizes a specially engineered particulate filler that acts as an acoustic band gap filter and contrast agent at particular frequencies. Oceanit leverages over $1.5M of Oil &amp; Gas Industry investment in well sensing and smart cement development at Oceanit. Oceanit plans to further develop its smart acoustic cement and prepare for full-scale field trials through additional lab tests and sub-scale field tests at its established test site. These will include determining the range and resolution of stress measurements as well as optimizing the smart cement formulation. The goal of the project is to demonstrate significant value for the acoustic smart cement in detecting and thereby reducing well integrity risks due to cementing and formation issues."

        "abstract": "Nanoparticle synthesis chemistry has developed tremendously over the last several decades, achieving great control over size, shape, and composition. This has led to much greater understanding of material optical, electronic, and surface properties, and myriad applications, from solar cells and photodetectors to medical therapy. Currently, processes for building nanoparticles are largely based on bottom\u2010up chemical syntheses in either batch or flow cell configurations, requiring high temperature and, in some cases, high pressure. Residual solvents from these processes adversely affect the environment and disposal is costly. By exposing single\u2010source precursors\u2014molecules containing elements connected by a single chemical bond\u2014to carbon dioxide in a supercritical state, DOE researchers have developed a process to produce uniform nanoparticles at desired sizes. Instead of using high temperature, the process takes place at around 65 degrees Celsius, saving significant amounts of energy. While the patented method using supercritical fluids was originally conceived as a process for making nanomaterials for cost\u2010effective and high\u2010efficiency photovoltaic cells, the process is recognized to have potential in producing nanoparticle\u2010based materials for microelectronics, magnets, and thermoelectric devices, as well as for catalysts in the advanced manufacturing of platform chemicals. To address a worldwide need for a wideband low\u2010loss radome to protect radio frequency (RF) emitters and receivers in harsh environments, Voxtel proposes to commercialize the DOE\u2010developed supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) methods of fabricating nanoferrite nanoparticles for use in the additive manufacture of high\u2010efficiency nanocomposite radomes for the 10MHz to 28 GHz band, including the emerging 5G spectrum. Ideally, radomes would be fabricated from a material that protects the antenna but does not suffer from reflectance and attenuation losses common to existing materials. Nanocomposite materials are advantageous because of the unique properties of nanoparticles, e.g., chemical, optical, thermal, electrical, magnetic, etc. In Phase I, we will perform technology transfer of the DOE technologies to build SFE fabrication equipment capable of meeting the program technical objectives. We will first synthesize and fabricate a series of common nanocrystal materials, such as PbS, to demonstrate the ability to make commercial quantities of high precision. We will compare our results to alternative methods, including continuous flow reactors and batch reactors. We will then synthesize a simple ferrite precursor to demonstrate the feasibility of using the SFE precision\u2010 nanoparticle process to produce simple ZnFe2O4 nanoferrites, sized 60 \uf0b1 1nm. These nanoparticles will be incorporated in nanocomposite radome prototypes and tested. Finally, we will design a fully complex precursor for the more complex NiZnFe2O4 nanoparticles. In Phase II, we will: further refine the Phase I NiZnFe2O4 precursor chemistry; create a scaled\u2010up version of the SFE platform capable of generating kilograms\/month of the precision nanoferrite; and, through careful process control, demonstrate those volumes of NiZnFe2O4 with \uf0b1 0.2nm control, which will be used in the fabrication of cost\u2010effective novel energy\u2010efficient all\u2010weather antenna system covers. Environmental and reliability testing will be performed."

        "abstract": "Widespread adoption of electric vehicles is hindered by the weight, size, and cost of battery technology. Lithium-ion battery technology is plateauing in performance, and next-generation solutions are required to deliver step change improvements. Lithium metal batteries promise greatly reduced weight compared to lithium-ion, but they suffer from serious performance, cycle stability, and safety issues because of incompatibility with conventional organic electrolytes. This project proposes a lithium metal rechargeable battery based on a non-flammable and chemically stable electrolyte that has demonstrated enhanced compatibility with lithium metal anodes and high-voltage cathodes. The objective of the project is to improve the rate capability of the electrolyte with the use of different co-solvents that improve physical properties while maintaining oxidative stability at high voltage and cycling stability with lithium metal. This work will bring the cycling performance and rate capability of the lithium metal battery chemistry much closer to commercial viability for electric vehicle applications. The proposed project will identify and screen the most promising and commercially viable co- solvents for use in a high-voltage lithium metal chemistry. Based on the electrochemical data collected in the screening process, the most promising candidates will be down-selected for an expanded experimental study. That work will focus on further optimization of the co-solvent content as well as assessing the benefits of combining multiple co-solvents. The most promising electrolyte compositions will be assessed in rate and cycle life tests in commercially representative coin cells, and the best-performing electrolytes will finally be cycled and studied in single-layer pouch cells."

        "abstract": "The goal of this phase I project is to evaluate and demonstrate the feasibility of fabricating high density interconnects and micro-bumps for high performance stacked chip detector instrumentation using an innovative additive manufacturing technology called confined electro-deposition (CED) printing developed during 2017. The Phase I work plan includes the following objectives: 1. Room temperature 3D additive printing of micron wide copper interconnects on silicon chip edges that can enable chip-to-chip &amp; wafer-to-wafer interconnection and minimize dead regions at device edges. 2. Room temperature 3D additive printing of 10-20 micron diameter copper-core solder micro-bumps for high density vertical stacking of chips and wafers. 3. Characterization of adhesion, electrical and mechanical properties of 3D printed bumps and interconnects in relation to high density instrumentation requirements. 4. Development of standard operating procedures for 3D printing of micro-bumps and high density interconnects; including deposition rate calculations, techno-economic modeling and preliminary reliability\/environmental testing. 5. Development of Phase II plans involving fabrication of a 3D printed high density multi-chip detector instrumentation in collaboration with NSCL at MSU, and a detector chip manufacturer. The advantages of the proposed technology include fine line pure copper interconnects (both vertical and horizontal) at room temperature without any need for masks, directly on chips and wafers; fabrication of high strength copper core to produce reliable solder micro-bumps in the sub 50 micron range for chip-to-chip &amp; wafer-to-wafer stacking."

        "abstract": "From a recent DOE EERE report, approximately 50 million dry tons of organic waste is available in the US for upgrading into renewable fuels (and chemicals) equivalent to nearly 7,300 MMGGE.These wastes include inedible fats and greases, food and beverage waste waters, livestock manures, municipal wastewater, and the organic fraction of municipal solid wastes. Conversion of these feedstocks into renewable bio-fuels offers a range of economic and environmental advantages and hence represents a significant opportunity for new market development. Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is a promising conversion technology for these wet waste streams (relative to pyrolysis, gasification, etc.). However, although technical feasibility\/potential has been shown, economic viability is still a challenge and several technology gaps in the scale-up to commercial scale continuous processing are evident xxx.Further, these wastes are widely distributed throughout the US (and world) requiring technology that is modular and adaptable, with regard to cost and complexity, to scales well below conventional petroleum refineries. As a solution to these problems, MPT proposes to integrate its high performance ceramic membranes into the conventional HTL technology. Significant processing cost savings are achieved due to surprising synergies that develop between these technologies. For instance, higher added value biochemicals and biocrude are simultaneously produced while biochar and waste gas production is reduced. Hence, overall carbon yield is significantly enhanced from ~45% to &gt;65%. Further, the innovative water management strategy that the ceramic membranes enable also offers surprising synergies with HTL technology. These include simplified final product separation, improved thermal efficiency, lower energy consumption, and reduced capital cost. Based upon these factors, preliminary technoeconomic analysis suggests biofuel\/biochemicals production cost can be pushed below $2\/gge with the proposed approach, making the biofuel cost competitive with petroleum-based fuels. Further, this significant cost reduction as well as the modular and simple design makes it suitable for small scale distributed processing. During the Phase I program we will be conducting bench scale membrane enhanced hydrothermal liquefaction of sewage sludge to demonstrate the proposed concept, develop initial operating conditions, show the potential product yield and quality improvement, and establish the technoeconomic base case. This information will be used to establish the program technical approach in the Phase II pilot scale demonstration."

        "abstract": "Extremely good timing resolution is becoming more and more important in both high energy collider detectors and for commercial industry applications such as LIDAR for self-driving cars. The needs have grown such that resolutions at the 1 ps level are desired, since better resolutions leads to better performance. Unfortunately, the electronics capable of 1 ps resolution, and the ability to send a synchronous clock with sub-5 ps jitter to timing electronics separated by 10-20 meters, does not currently exist. We are designing a board based on the DRS4 ASIC, which does have 1 ps resolution but which does not work for many applications, particularly for collider detectors, because of the short 205 ns buffer when operated in the normal design. We implement a locally triggered, region-of-interest readout that digitizes just the regions where there is a signal above threshold, and can thus store the signal in a digital buffer for later retrieval, thus extending the effective buffer depth tremendously. We will use commercially available jitter reducing PLLs from Silicon Labs and other vendors, which are rated for 90 fs phase jitter, to test whether a sub-5 ps jitter synchronous fanout can be developed using off-the-shelf components. We will develop a DRS4FEM analog board consisting of the DRS4 ASIC, 8-ch 40 MHz ADC, and fast comparators for a signal timestamp to test our concept for building a 1 ps capable, deeply buffered, board around the DRS4. We also will build a clock fan-out using PLLs from Silicon Labs and other vendors, which will let us test whether a sub-5 ps jitter synchronous clock can be propagated to electronics separated by 10-20 meters. Our board would effectively be a very affordable oscilloscope (an order of magnitude cheaper than comparable oscilloscopes). The lowered cost of our scope will greatly expand the number of research groups that can afford to do research in fast time. We should also benefit the LIDAR community."

        "abstract": "Inorganic scintillator crystals used for nuclear security applications typically have a large refractive index which tends to trap, via total internal reflection, much of the light they produce. Photia Inc., in collaboration with its industry partner Alpha Spectra Inc. and partners at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), will develop nanostructured coatings to enhance light extraction from scintillator crystals used in radiation detectors. These coatings will use two-dimensional and three-dimensional photonic crystals to reduce internal reflections at the surface of the scintillator which is coupled to the photodetector system. Manufacturing with interference lithography will allow for large scale production of light extraction coatings, which increases the utility of their application in commercial radiation detectors. Briefly, the proposed research in Phase 1 consists of the following tasks. Mathematical modeling techniques will be used to determine the photonic crystal patterns which are most promising for enhancing light extraction. Light extraction coatings will be manufactured with interference lithography and tested in conditions which simulate a scintillator crystal. Utilizing insight from modeling and experiment, optimally designed light extraction coatings will be manufactured and delivered to collaborators at LBNL and Alpha Spectra Inc. for testing in scintillation detector systems. The overall light extraction efficiency and energy resolution will be compared with traditional coupling methods."

The energy content of these wastes is vast and converting these wastes to high value liquid fuels has real economic potential. TDA Research will improve the existing anaerobic biofuel production process by producing in-line extraction of Medium Chain Carboxylic Acids (MCCAs). We will apply in-line extraction to remove these products, simultaneously recovering the MCCAs and reducing the inhibition that they cause in the reactor. A novel membrane extraction technology will be applied. In the Phase I of the project, we will design and carry out bench-scale proof-of-concept tests of the whole biofuel production process. The best membrane for this process will be identified. A full scale modular system will be designed and its techno-economic potential evaluated."

        "abstract": "Current bioconversion technologies for producing fuels and chemicals from biomass suffer from significant carbon loses in the form of carbon dioxide. This is a fundamental property of the oxidation states of the inputs and outputs, and it results in low carbon efficiency. Carbon dioxide emitted during bioconversion could be recycled into additional fuels and chemicals. Industrial Microbes and Opus 12 have developed novel biochemical and electrochemical catalysts that can be combined to achieve near 100% carbon conversion. Biogas, a mixture of methane and carbon dioxide, is used as the renewable starting material for making a target chemical. Carbon dioxide present in the biogas and produced by the fermentation will be recycled to make additional methane, powered by renewable electricity. The process starts with waste biogas from a biorefinery, wastewater treatment plant, or other biogas source. In Phase I, two complementary technologies will be improved and combined. First, the robustness of an electrochemical reactor that utilizes renewable electricity to recycle carbon dioxide to methane production will be improved. Next, a biocatalyst that converts methane to three-carbon chemicals will be optimized. Finally, the electrochemical reactor will be combined with the biocatalyst to fully convert biogas carbon to the target product. At the end of Phase I, the teams will demonstrate production of a chemical target from both methane and carbon dioxide. In Phase II, the teams will integrate and optimize their catalysts into a single product."

        "abstract": "The OLED lighting market requires significant acceleration to realize its promise of expanding SSL adoption, saving energy and creating US manufacturing jobs. The major barriers slowing the adoption of OLED lighting today are the relatively high cost and lower performance relative to LED lighting. Costs will come down by economies-of-scale as volumes grow, and OLED materials are becoming less expensive as OLED display volumes grow. However, innovations are needed to reduce the cost of substrates and to enable lower cost roll-to-roll (R2R) processing methods, while at the same time improving the energy efficiency of OLED lighting. In this project, OLEDWorks will develop a high efficacy and cost-effective flexible OLED lighting system which will reduce the cost of OLED light by introducing a combination of printable and scalable internal light extraction and transparent conductive silver nanowire technologies that are compatible with R2R methods, and demonstrate these technical advances on bendable glass and flexible plastic substrates. Higher power efficacy will be achieved by co-optimization of the internal extraction, silver nanowire anode, and stacked white OLED to reduce unwanted absorption, increase the outcoupling efficiency, and lower the OLED voltage. Through co-optimization of these component systems, world-class power efficacy of 100 lm\/W or greater can be demonstrated in a flexible OLED lighting panel. During Phase I, two versions of a printable internal extraction layer (IEL) system available from development partners will be demonstrated on a bendable substrate using a small-scale OLED device format. After initial assessment on the industry standard indium tin oxide (ITO) anode, the IEL will be demonstrated in combination with the alternate silver nanowire anode to produce OLED samples with 90 lm\/W efficacy. Improved organic materials will be implemented in a stacked white OLED architecture and combined with the improved IEL and anode component technologies to demonstrate an efficacy of 100 lm\/W. In Phase II, this technology will be further optimized and scaled up, and commercial product platforms will be developed and launched that use this technology from our Rochester manufacturing facility. The technological advances developed in this program will enable bendable OLED lighting, which is expected to unleash creativity and create pull from the lighting design community, with higher performance and affordability. This innovative project will significantly help the OLED solid-state lighting industry grow, leading to energy savings in the multi-billions of dollars resulting from significant reduction in electricity consumption due to lighting. The technology developed in this project will also help the US compete in the growing OLED industry thereby creating US manufacturing jobs and maintaining a technological advantage in the field of solid-state lighting."

        "abstract": "Advancement in detector technology is continuously ongoing as the needs of high-energy experimental facilities evolve. For example, upgrades are needed at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) as the luminosity is increased. Without advancing fast detector technology many future high energy physics experiments will be limited by the timing capabilities of current particle detector technology. One of the improvements currently being sought are silicon based detectors that offer fast timing resolution for direct particle detection that can process at high event rates. If a timing resolution on the order of 10s of picoseconds is achieved, this opens the possibility of using time-of-flight techniques to improve the precision of high-energy particle experiments.Our detector can intrinsically achieve a time resolution of 10s of picoseconds, however, the detector packaging needs a compact module design which integrates the detector with a custom fast signal amplifier, while preserving the detector\u2019s fast resolution. Our proposed detector module is based on RMD\u2019s silicon avalanche photodetector (APD) technology.During Phase I we will 1) optimize packaging and metallization techniques to better produce mesh APDs, 2) engineer a custom fast readout amplifier for the mesh APD and integrate with the detector to create a detector module, and 3) evaluate and characterize detector modules for electrical characteristics, gain and noise, and their ultra-fast timing performance as a function of radiation damage. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: The general application for this detector technology is for charged particle detection. An optimized instrument could be used for human missions, satellites, and space exploration probes that need charged particle detection. Optical applications, such as LIDAR, in need of ultra-fast timing could benefit from the technology as well."

        "abstract": "Radio frequency (RF) power devices using (GaN) high-electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) have revolutionized power electronic applications due to superior electrical performances enabled by the excellent material characteristics of GaN HEMTs. However, the increasing power densities demanded from RF devices have led to serious thermal management issues which limits the device lifetime. Current cooling technologies are not ideal for high RF power devices because they result in mechanical stress between the transistors and the cooling system, have limitations in removing large heat fluxes, lead to high pumping power, and result in flow instabilities and hotspots, by using diamond heat sinks, heat pipes, microchannel liquid cooling, and microchannel two-phase cooling, respectively. Advanced Cooling Technologies, Inc. (ACT) proposes an innovative Hybrid Two-Phase Cooling System (HTPCS) to remove large amounts of heat from transistors in high RF power devices. The cooling system is CTE-matched (CTE: coefficient of thermal expansion) and dielectric, and operates with the minimal flow rates and pumping power, and provides highly isothermal transistors. ACT proposes an innovative HTPCS that can remove a large amount of heat from transistors, and provide highly isothermal transistors (due to the nature of two-phase heat transfer mechanism). The cooling system is essentially a hybrid between a pumped two-phase cooling loop with capillary driven two-phase cooling. The capillary evaporation takes place from the evaporator wick structures, which are continuously supplied with liquid refrigerant by a pump. The proposed cooling system is CTE-matched, and dielectric. The working fluid is refrigerant due to its dielectric strength. The primary objective of the Phase I effort is to develop a prototype HTPCS and conduct the performance tests to demonstrate the capability of the cooling system to remove heat fluxes over 200 W\/cm2 from individual transistors, and a total heat over 120 W from each substrate that includes four transistors in series. This task will be done by fabricating a copper-based cooling enclosure and conducting its performance tests. By the end of Phase I, the final CTE-matched cooling enclosure will be fabricated and its hermeticity will be checked. Also, a preliminary thermal modeling will be developed to characterize the thermal performance of the proposed cooling system.Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: A CTE-matched and highly efficient cooling system for the challenging RF power applications results in enhancing the reliability and the maximum power output of RF devices, and allows for wider adoption of RF devices in a broad range of applications such as wireless communications, data centers, renewable energy, electric vehicles, etc."

        "abstract": "Vanadium is a critical contributor to many different clean energy applications. It is directly used in the most common titanium alloy, Ti-6Al-4V. However, over 80% of the vanadium produced is used in steel production as ferrovanadium master alloy. Vanadium is an essential component to the high-strength low alloy (HSLA) steels and many advanced high strength steels (AHSS) that are being employed for lightweighting vehicles. We propose a novel approach to extract vanadium from its oxide. This novel approach provides primary energy savings: it uses less energy to extract a ton of vanadium than the current process of aluminothermic reduction. Our approach will also have secondary energy contributions: reducing the cost of ferrovanadium while improving its purity will accelerate the adoption of the high-performance steels that require vanadium. Developed at MIT, Molten Oxide Electrolysis (MOE) has been demonstrated at the lab- scale for a number of metals including iron, nickel, chromium, titanium, and ferromanganese, and at industrial pilot-scale with ferromanganese. Analogous to the Hall-H\u00e9roult process for the production of molten aluminum, MOE enables high-throughput molten production of metals and alloys that are commonly made in solid form with more expensive and slower processes. MOE enables the direct processing of oxides, the most common feedstock form of these metals. In Phase I, we will perform a detailed modeling investigation of the production of pure vanadium and ferrovanadium by MOE, determine the necessary adaptations to our pilot reactor, and perform a validation experiment in that pilot-scale reactor. In Phase II, we will refine the process, focusing on energy efficiency, vanadium recovery, and chemical purity of the product."

        "abstract": "Fusion reactors are a promising economic source of clean energy. In order to achieve the break-even operation, the future reactors, such as DEMO, will feature very high, &gt; 16 Tesla, magnetic fields, which can be only created by magnet coils wound with the second generation (2G) superconducting wire. The 2G wires are currently manufactured as thin (1-2 micron) YBCO layer deposited on a metal substrate. The substrate takes a considerable portion of the cross-section, thus reducing the engineering current density, preventing effective inter-filament current sharing and transposition. The geometry is also responsible for high magnetization loss. Reducing the magnetization loss is especially critical for the central solenoid which operates under pulsed load. Brookhaven Technology Group proposes development of a new type of high-temperature superconducting cable for the central solenoid of a high-field fusion reactor. The product combines two recent innovations: (i) Reduction of AC loss by bundling narrow, 1-2 mm, exfoliated YBCO filaments into a transposed cable, (ii) continuous winding technology which eliminates labor-intensive and expensive handling of narrow filaments. The engineering critical current density of the wire will thus increase to over 2,000 A\/mm^2, in 10 T, HIIc, 4.2 K; the projected cost of the filament is expected to remain below $20\/KA*m, for the same operating conditions. The cable geometry enables x5 magnetization loss reduction compared to the state of the art 2G cables. Phase I activities will include the following tasks: (i) design and assembly of a continuous cabling system prototype. The system would allow for reel-to-reel manufacturing of a cable from a wide exfoliated tape; (ii) Manufacturing of a cable prototype of the spiral stack geometry; (iii) Low-temperature transport measurements and high field, 0.6 Tesla, measurement of magnetization loss. At the end of Phase I, BTG will characterize a 1 m coupon of superconducting cable comprised of four layers of the exfoliated filament. The cable will contain only copper, silver and pinning-enhanced YBCO. Low-temperature measurements will be carried out at National High Magnetic Field Laboratory and Wright Patterson Air Base. The Phase II goal is development of a scaled-up cabling system capable of producing &gt; 1 km of the cable."

        "abstract": "Advanced nuclear reactor systems utilize liquid metal coolants, which requires that reactor component materials be corrosion resistant while maintaining safety, reliability, and performance criteria in normal reactor operation as well as in accident scenarios. Niowave, in collaboration with Los Alamos National Laboratory and the University of Michigan, is currently developing a hybrid fast\/thermal spectrum subcritical testbed, coupled to a superconducting electron linac, to provide peak fast-spectrum neutron fluxes greater than 1015 n\/cm2s in heavy- liquid metal environment. The facility will be used to test novel fuels, materials, instruments and components, reactor safety designs, provide data for reactor code development, and support the regulatory process for licensing novel technology.An initial proof-of-concept fast neutron source, driven by a superconducting linac and lead-bismuth eutectic (LBE) neutron converter already exists at Niowave. Additionally, Niowave\u2019s Radioisotope Program established both the facilities and the NRC license to operate a subcritical uranium assembly and perform nuclear fuel reprocessing. In the hybrid subcritical testbed, LBE is used as a neutron converter and coolant. To determine compatible materials with LBE, materials such as niobium, austenitic steel (i.e., 316L), ferritic\/martensitic steel (i.e., HT9), and ODS (i.e., MA956) steel have been tested in stagnant LBE up to 700 \u00b0C at Niowave.Niowave has decided to expand this work and develop a corrosion test station (CTS) using LBE for improved characterization and examination of advanced nuclear reactor fuels and materials. In Phase I, a detailed engineering design along with all the various components of the station will be completed. The corrosion test station will be built from stainless steel and operated at temperature up to 500 \u00b0C. In Phase II, the CTS will be built with parts made of Nb or Nb-SS bimetal for the sample test section and operated at temperatures up to 700 \u00b0C with flow velocities capable of exceeding 5 m\/s. The samples include novel cladding and reactor structural materials, and actual nuclear fuel specimens (i.e., U, U-Zr, U-TRU-Zr, and UO2) or surrogates that will be tested for extended amount of time. Ultimately, this station will support the nuclear energy community\u2019s fuels and materials qualification program by providing means to develop, characterize, and examine promising materials for advanced reactors."

DOE requests small business proposals to develop advanced components for energy conversion systems that support supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO2) Brayton power cycle systems. Such power cycles offer increased conversion efficiency, over 50%, as compared to current systems, and are therefore of interest for advanced high temperature nuclear power plants, as well as for Generation 3 Concentrated Solar Power and more efficient advanced fossil power plants. Specifically, DOE asks for proposals to develop piping systems that can accommodate 900 oC turbine inlet temperature conditions. Previous work sponsored by the DOE have focused on using high nickel alloy piping systems that can handle temperatures up to 750 oC. However these alloys showed significant corrosion when exposed to sCO2 at these high temperatures, and also lose much of their strength at such high temperatures requiring extremely thick and costly piping. Silicon Carbide (SiC) ceramic materials demonstrated better corrosion behavior in sCO2, and are known to retain high strength capability up to 1200 oC, thus allowing reasonable thickness piping leading to much lower cost. However, this SiC ceramic material has not been seriously considered for high temperature piping because of concerns over brittle failure. Ceramic Tubular Products has solved this problem with an innovative approach that combines an inner layer of monolithic Silicon Carbide ceramic which is hermetic, with an outer layer of Ceramic Matrix Composite that is not brittle and behaves with a stress - strain relationship similar to metals. We have demonstrated the ability of our product to serve as Accident Tolerant Fuel cladding for current LWR nuclear power plants, with commercial demonstration planned in the next few years as part of a joint DOE - industry program. We believe our product can also be applied to the very high pressure, high temperature, Brayton energy cycle systems, operating initially at temperatures up to 720 oC, and eventually at temperatures up to 900 oC. We are also evaluating the application of this material for use as Solar Receiver tubes in molten chloride salt based Concentrated Solar Power systems operating at temperatures up to 800 oC, under a Small Business Voucher program at Sandia Labs sponsored by DOE EERE. We believe our unique tubular material can be adapted to the larger diameter piping systems (6 to 14&quot; diameter) needed for commercial Brayton power cycles, operating at temperatures up to 900 oC. We are proposing an SBIR project to demonstrate this potential. In Phase 1 we will demonstrate feasibility by fabricating multilayered ceramic piping using existing off the shelf Hexoloy 3 inch SiC tubes, winding the composite layer using two different low cost commercial grade ceramic fibers and then infiltrating the composite layer with a low cost Silicon Oxy- Carbide polymer. CTP will then perform a series of mechanical and thermal tests on sections of these tubes to determine properties. We have also arranged for a 2000 hour test at DOE&apos;s Sandia Laboratories to demonstrate the compatibility of SiC piping with supercritical CO2 at 900 oC. Pending success of the Phase 1 project, we propose a Phase II project to scale up the size and manufacturing capability and pipe size as needed to support a Brayton cycle demonstration project (cost shared with industry) currently being considered by DOE under nuclear, fossil and EERE programs. Phase II will include longer term high pressure durability tests, demonstration of recently developed joining techniques to replace the field welding function used for metal alloy piping systems, and acquiring the data needed to achieve certification of our piping material by ASME code committees. Commercial Applications: This work proposed, if successful, will enable the completion of one or more joint industry-DOE Brayton cycle demonstration projects, and subsequent commercial projects using the high efficiency Brayton cycle to convert advanced nuclear energy, concentrated solar energy, and advanced fossil energy heat sources into low cost electricity for US consumers."

        "abstract": "Superconducting magnets are critical components in particle accelerators and are used to generate and sustain the large magnetic fields needed for DOE\u2019s High Energy Physics programs. Superconducting magnets are also commonly used in medical imaging, spectroscopy, and fusion energy applications. Current state-of-the-art Nb3Sn magnets suffer from long training cycles before stable magnet performance can be realized. The primary objective of the Phase I work is to address magnet quenching through improvements in the epoxy electrical insulation, resulting in significantly reduced training times for Nb3Sn magnets Key features of the development effort include improvements in thermal conductivity to improve heat dissipation and reduce quenching and improving insulation flexibility to reduce cracking that can induce a magnet quench. The overall goal of this proposed Phase I program is to address heat dissipation and reduce cracking in the epoxy insulation systems used for high energy physics magnets. In Phase I, epoxy systems incorporating additives known for high cryogenic thermal conductivity will be developed. A parallel effort in improving crack resistance of the insulation will also be conducted. Thermal, electrical, and mechanical performance of the resulting systems will be demonstrated.Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: In addition to benefitting the high energy physics and fusion energy applications, the proposed work will benefit several segments of the U.S. economy. These include medical imaging, scientific instruments, transportation, and defense. Specific examples include superconducting magnets for Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance systems."

        "abstract": "Nature is the master manufacturer. We propose to mimic the way the ribosome builds biomolecules in order to make complex molecular building blocks that will, in their first use as a product, function as very complex pores in our water purification and desalination nanomembrane system. These pores will be focused on removing extremely challenging contaminants and toxins. With the expanding use of desalination and wastewater remediation to meet the nation\u2019s fundamental water requirements, the critical economic and environmental needs for reducing energy requirements and enhancing operational functionality can be addressed by a low energy one-atomic-layer-thick membrane that incorporates biomimetic technology to achieve high purity water from seriously contaminated feedstocks. The development of novel cyclic organic synthons capable of being used as building blocks for the self- assembly of porous, Langmuir- Film (LF) derived nanomembranes has led to the development of the first 2-dimensional membranes. The LF- derived nanomembranes provide for exquisite solute selectivity and, theoretically, provide the minimal energy barrier to solvent passage. Creating complex, but filters at less than 50nm thickness allow extremely challenging materials to be removed at low cost. Small footprint systems minimize capital costs and allow for high purity, distributed water purification and desalination systems, thus enhancing water security. After designing scaffolds using computer-aided molecular design techniques, we will synthesize the two types of scaffolds needed to \u201cmimic\u201d the logical functionality that a ribosome uses to build a protein. We will use standard organic chemistry methods which will allow for technology scale-up."

        "abstract": "Many plasma physics experiments not only further the understanding of the behavior of plasmas but also pursue nuclear fusion as a safe, clean, and reliable energy source. A common problem for these experiments is a lack of effective feedback control on microsecond timescales. Plasmas can deviate from their nominal parameters on such timescales and faster corrections help ensure the plasma stays within a desired parameter space. An emerging solution is utilizing the highly parallel nature of graphics processing unit (GPU) architecture to simultaneously process all relevant data and compute the appropriate feedback signals in microseconds. In Phase I, a new, high-speed digitization and feedback control system will be built, and feedback algorithms developed to simultaneously analyze nine signals and control six separate banks of alternating current (AC) power supplies for a plasma physics experiment. The project goal is to control the imposed voltages and magnetic fluxes within 5% in amplitude and 0.5 microseconds in time. The limits of the technology will be tested as the AC frequency is increased toward 100 kHz. In Phase II and beyond, many more signals will be added to fully utilize the unique capabilities of GPU architecture. Fast equilibrium fitting will also be integrated yielding a whole-device feedback control system with lower latency than similar, central processing unit (CPU)-based systems. The technology will be marketed to public and private, domestic and international, plasma physics experiments as well as any application with many signals and microsecond-scale control needs."

        "abstract": "The rapid expansion of renewable and distributed energy sources requires significant changes to the electric grid.Primary among these is the ability to move and store energy, converting from low DC sources to high voltage for transmission. Reducing losses in the conversion process is essential to this function. Wide Band Gap semiconductors are becoming available to dramatically reducing switching losses, but performance of passive devices, and particularly magnetic cores have not advanced as rapidly as active components for high power applications. This Phase I SBIR will develop nanostructured iron-cobalt magnetic core materials derived from engineered particles. By controlling eddy current loop sizes to the micron range simultaneously with domain size and grain size at the nano and macroscale using advanced synthesis and processing techniques, magnetic cores operating in the MHz range with saturation values of 2T and coercivities of 100Oe can be produced economically, dramatically reducing the size, cost, and losses associated with power conversion devices. The phase I program will prepare nanostructured starting particles, and characterize the magnetic and mechanical properties as a function of grain size, domain size, and content, arrangement, and type of insulating phases."

        "abstract": "A crisis is brewing in the utilities industry. Out of date infrastructure and a rapidly retiring workforce contribute to a new generation of workers who find themselves unable to quickly and effectively solve problems. TiER1 Performance Solutions and the Gronstedt Group propose a solution that will put the power of augmented reality (AR) and the knowledge of experienced utility personnel into the hands of field operators. Our solution will bridge the skill gap in the utility industry and equip the workforce with the information they need to solve problems, at the point of need. Specifically, we propose to develop an augmented reality (AR)- based solution, the Distributed Sharable Knowledge (AR-DiSK) toolkit, to address three challenges in the utilities industry: (1) the impending wave of knowledge loss, (2) the burdensome cost of training and knowledge management, and (3) the need to support management in the development and deployment of employees. AR holds the potential to profoundly change skill development and performance support, and provides a key component of the DESK toolkit. In particular, AR-DiSK will support (1) distributed collaboration through the use of AR technology; (2) the gathering knowledge and expertise from workers during real-time operational scenarios, structured interviews, and annotated \u201chow to\u201d videos; and (3) ready access to a library of resources, including videos, just-in-time training, procedures, \u201chelpful hints,\u201d and SME contact information. To support collaboration, AR-DiSK will enable remote experts to work \u201cside-by-side\u201d with field workers through a live camera feed streamed through the AR headset worn by the field operator. Talking through two-way voice communication, the remote expert will guide the field technician through the work by annotating the technician\u2019s view with instructions that the expert provides on a touch screen. Using x\u2019s, numbers, and arrows, the expert will indicate the correct sequence of buttons to press, or levers to switch, to resolve a problem. The field technician sees these instructions overlaid on the physical object through their AR headset. The remote expert employs instructional videos or 3D instructional animations as needed. Procedures from a manual become 3D holograms that walk the operator through a task. Animations provide the field operator with \u201cx-ray vision\u201d of underground cables and other hidden features. The user experience replicates an expert at the user\u2019s side, regardless of location. In addition to supporting collaboration, AR-DiSK will enable the gathering and recording of expert inputs and will provide a library of resources, including tools to support knowledge elicitation, knowledge management, and design systems, so that information is easily accessible to the personnel who need it. Phase I provides the foundational analyses necessary for the development of AR-DiSK. The main Phase I tasks are to map potential AR solutions to utility industry challenges, identify specific use cases and constraints, and develop a storyboard prototype of a knowledge elicitation and sharing tool."

        "abstract": "The confluence of rapidly growing in residential and commercial PV solar and new advancements in economically viable energy storage has led to the surging rise of individual energy prosumers (connected to the grid both producing and consuming electricity). This rise in distributed energy resources (DERs) or prosumers require new technologies to realize the potential values of DERs, such as increasing the reliability and resiliency of the electrical grid, making load more dynamic and responsive to wholesale market price signals, encouraging the use of more renewable energy, while improving overall system efficiencies. A promising solution is a transactional energy and control framework, wherein mutually-beneficial and cost-effective market transactions can be reached between multiple players across different domains. Specifically, peer-to-peer energy transaction technologies, such as Blockchain encoded smart contracts, allow participants (e.g., individual residences, commercial operators, DERs and their aggregators, or utilities) in the network to transact directly with other network participants without involving a third-party intermediary, reducing transmission time and costs. ecoLong proposes to develop an advanced peer-to- peer transactive energy platform with predictive optimization that bridge the gap from virtual to real world through relevant and game-changing technology. Our overarching goal is to develop a proof-of-concept prototype of the proposed platform. We will address our goal through the following objectives: (1) Integrating the weather\/solar monitoring and forecasting agents; (2) Implementing predictive optimization; (3) Developing the blockchain based peer-to-peer transactive energy platform; and (4) Developing an energy pricing strategy."

        "abstract": "A novel low-cost and high-performance photon detector that can be manufactured by the modern high-volume technologies is widely sought for in high-energy particle measurements and other scientific imaging applications. This novel detector needs to combine accurate photon-counting capability, large photosensitive area, fast response, high quantum efficiency, and compatibility with cryogenic temperature, high-pressure, and magnetic field. Quanta image sensor is a novel platform solid-state imaging technology, which is completely compatible with the standard CMOS manufacturing processes for low-cost and high-volume production. The detectors in Quanta Image Sensor, called \u201cjots,\u201d can achieve accurate photon-counting capability without the use of electron avalanche gain or cooling. It can provide more advanced photon-counting performance with the linear photon-counting response, high-speed readout, zero dead time, high quantum efficiency, low dark count, high dynamic range, and high stability. A Quanta Image Sensor that is suitable for high-energy physics and other scientific applications will be developed in this project with validated core technologies. In Phase I, the compatibility of low-temperature operation will be evaluated with existing Gigajot\u2019s prototype product. A larger jot detector and a high-speed ADC will be designed to satisfy the requirements of a large photosensitive area and high-speed response. The paths of developing products for UV photon detection will be explored.Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: A broad range of applications can benefit from the outcome of this project. These applications include scientific applications such as high energy particle LHC experiments, astronomical imaging, fluorescence measurement, and flow cytometry; medical imaging applications such as scintillation measurements, molecular imaging, and capsule endoscopy; industrial applications such as surface inspection and radiation monitoring; and consumer applications such as 3D depth imaging and sensing, robotic imaging, automotive, optical communication, robotic sensing, and internet of things."

        "abstract": "Scintillators coupled to photomultiplier tubes or silicon photomultipliers are the most common detectors for X- ray\/gamma ray detection, and recent years have seen the development of many excellent scintillator materials, used for the detection, measurement and imaging of ionizing radiation. However, due to the high refractive indices of these scintillators, techniques currently used for coupling scintillators to photodetectors are not efficient, and hence the excellent timing and high light output properties of such scintillators are not fully utilized. New means of maximizing the light transfer from the scintillator to the detector are, therefore, needed. In recent years, several different approaches have been investigated to increase the light extraction from scintillators, but none of them provide a cost-effective, scalable solution. To date, the highest extraction efficiency has been demonstrated using photonic crystals fabricated by electron beam lithography, which is a complex and slow process that is limited to very small areas, making it impractically expensive to use. To address this issue, we propose to use subwavelength gradient-index (GRIN) nanostructures that will rival the performance of photonic crystals, but will use a process that is scalable, fast, reproducible, and cheap, and can be implemented on both planar and non-planar curved surfaces on a manufacturing scale. The Phase I goal is to develop subwavelength GRIN nanostructures that provide an adiabatic transition in the RI from the scintillator to the photodetector. Because of the graded index profile, the proposed GRIN nanostructures will provide broadband, omnidirectional improvements in the transmission at the dielectric interface. These nanostructures will be imprinted in custom-developed, but low-cost, high-RI polymers with optical transmission and reliability optimized for the scintillator of choice. The Phase I effort will focus on reliability, performance, and cost of the proposed technology, and will develop methods to quantify enhancements in extraction efficiency and robustness of the GRIN nanostructure coatings."

        "abstract": "Accelerators are complex scientific instruments requiring significant resources and effort to de- sign and build. At the largest scale, accelerators for use in physics discovery are billion-dollar- class facilities that take decades to develop. Medical accelerators can cost millions of dollars. Other electromagnetic applications include threat detection, antenna design, wireless device de- sign, and the treatment of cancer. Advanced simulation codes have been developed for these sys- tems which also include the ability to determine the optimal shape for electromagnetic compo- nents using advanced optimization techniques. However, the current optimization process is not suitable for general usage due to limitations on how it implements geometry and mesh updates needed for the simulation. By providing fully automatic geometry and mesh updates that inte- grate with the overall simulation process, this project will make these powerful design tools available to a wide audience. This project will develop software components that enable the fully automatic geometry optimi- zation of accelerator and other electromagnetic systems. Specific capabilities to be developed will provide the ability to: Define shape optimization parameters on an existing geometric model of a component and up- date the geometry based on changes to those parameters. Automatically update the computational mesh based on changes to the geometric model shape. Give all the necessary input to the shape optimization procedures. Integrate with the simulation codes and optimization process to provide fully automatic shape optimization capabilities.Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: The project will provide industry, government labs and universities an effective means to take full advantage of existing parallel simulation software. It is only through the development and introduction of these geometry and meshing technologies that industry can broadly integrate high performance parallel simulations into their design processes. The availability of truly automatic shape optimization procedures will enable more efficient and higher performance designs to be quickly realized, providing savings both in the design process and in operation."

        "abstract": "The number of polarization sensitive detectors need for field deployed Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) experiments has been growing steadily from 1000 of stage-II to 10,000 stage-III and projected detectors of over 100,000 for CMB-S4 experiments. P5 recommendation: &quot;The Particle Physics Project Prioritization Panel (P5) outlined a strategic plan for US particle physics research over the coming decade in 2014. The panel recommended, &quot;support CMB experiments as part of the core particle physics program. The multidisciplinary nature of the science warrants continued multiagency support.&quot; In response to the recommendation, CMB community started planning CMB Stage IV (CMB-S4), which aims to make definitive measurement of the early universe with ~100,000 detectors.&quot; Such a task will involve the fabrication of over 1000 successful wafers within a relatively short period. HYPRES in collaboration with LBNL will develop Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) superconducting detector array fabrication process on HYPRES\u2019s 150-mm (6-inch) superconducting electronics fabrication facility. HYPRES is the only commercial superconductor electronics company in the us equipped with 150 mm wafer processing equipment. This process will be scalable for a higher volume, lower cost, high yield production to meet the requirements of the stage-IV. It has increasingly been clear that the next phase of development of detectors for CMB experiments will require well maintained with controlled environments micro-fabrication facilities. HYPRES\u2019 fabrication facility fits this requirement very well; added to that, the decades of experience with low temperature superconducting electronics fabrication processes gives HYPRES an edge to deliver wafers needed for the CMB experiments. The primary goal of this program is the development of cryogenic bolometer array technology for future Cosmic Microwave Background experiments. In doing so the project will focus on merging the niobium processes and MEMS processes on a 150 mm wafers. The experience and know how gained during the development effort will accelerate the fabrication development effort of many other applications within the Hypres product line that require these two fabrication processes. A streamlined and optimized MEMS processes will lead to a significant improvement in the performance and cost of fabrication processes. Some of the current and future application that would benefit from this include: transition edge sensor bolometers, RF-MEMS, tunable amplifiers, capacitive sensors, sensitive thermopile, through-vias for 3D chip integration of quantum computing circuits (QUBITS) to classical control circuits (HYPRES\u2019 ERSFQ logic)."

        "abstract": "Computational fluid dynamics methods are increasingly used for high fidelity modeling of complex systems, especially nuclear power systems. For example, the phenomenon of thermal stratification in a sodium-cooled fast reactor under natural circulation conditions is resolvable with computational fluid dynamics, but not traditional system-level models. The high accuracy of computational fluid dynamics incurs increased computational cost, however. Therefore methods providing high quality results at a reduced cost are in high demand.The goal of this project is to develop software to enable the production of high quality reduced order models using a parameterized proper orthogonal decomposition approach. The technology will enable high fidelity fast running models for arbitrary transients to be constructed from a set of steady state simulations. The fast running models will then be used to compute boron concentrations in the lower plenum and core region of a reactor or density variations in stratified pools of sodium cooled fast reactors.A reduced order model production workflow using proper orthogonal decomposition will be established with accompanying software. Large eddy simulation example problems will be carried out to be used as test cases. A prototype model will be generated with a parameterized inlet mass flow rate. The proposed formulation will be revisited to add the effects of pressure gradients and to allow for parameterization of more boundary conditions of different types, such as pressure outlets. The stability of the models will be assessed and recommendations for stabilization, such as adding closure models, will be made for Phase II work.Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: Proper orthogonal decomposition and similar methods have been well understood for decades. However, they have not been widely adopted for a few reasons including that they are difficult and time consuming to compute, their stability properties are unfavorable, and their calculation requires ad hoc software development. By leveraging recent developments and internal expertise, each of these concerns is addressed in the proposed work. The models produced by this work will have applications in nuclear reactor design and safety analysis as well as drag force computation for airfoils and automotive frames, to name just a few. Nearly any industry with large modeling and simulation components will benefit. A key application in the nuclear engineering community is for production of surrogate computational fluid dynamics models to couple with system level codes for safety analyses. The tool will be usable to rapidly compute detailed boron concentrations in the lower reactor plenum after certain accidents."

        "abstract": "Broad commercialization and adoption of electric drive vehicles (EVs) that meet the market requirements for driving range requires development of electrochemical storage technologies that can deliver high energy density while providing requisite power, cycle life and calendar life at a low cost. Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries are the current technology of choice for both consumer electronics and emerging EVs. However, the highest energy density Li-ion cells currently used for commercial portable power applications are still well over 100 $\/kWh in cost. On a $\/kWh basis, Li-ion costs are more greatly driven by cathode materials than by any other component, and therefore lower cost, high-performance next generation cathode materials are needed to provide higher energy density, lower cost Li-ion cells. CAMX Power is developing a novel low-cost, high voltage Li-ion cathode chemistry with long cycle life. This novel chemistry produced via a low-cost manufacturing process, enables Li-ion electric drive vehicle batteries that are lower cost and higher energy density.CAMX Power will resolve historical challenges of high voltage cathodes by developing an inexpensive manufacturing process, developing protective coatings based on ionically and electronically conducting materials to boost high temperature cycle life, and by developing electrolyte formulations that are stable for high voltage operation. In Phase I, we will optimize the process for synthesis of the high voltage spinel cathode and explore different techniques for coating the material with the protective layer. Best-performing materials will be evaluated with high voltage-stable electrolytes and implemented in 200mAh pouch cells for program demonstration."

        "abstract": "As the fusion science research advances towards the demonstration of practical reactors for commercial adoption there is a growing need to develop diagnostic systems for monitoring various plasma parameters in real time for control and shaping of the plasma density and profile. Recent, experiments have demonstrated the potential of a High-k Scattering system for studying turbulence physics studies by providing a measurement of the k\u03b8-spectrum of both electron temperature gradient (ETG) and ion temperature gradient (ITG) modes. Currently, a large and bulky Far Infrared (FIR) laser system in use at the National Spherical Torus Experiment - Upgrade (NSTX-U) for such experiments. The output power of the laser is only 50 mW at 693 GHz. The availability of a 5 W source which is more compact, robust and efficient will enable further development of this technique for eventual deployment in future reactors such as DEMO. We propose to develop a compact second harmonic gyrotron that can generate &gt; 5 W of continuous wave power at 693 GHz. The gyrotron technology can be easily extended to any frequency in the 1 THz range using currently available magnet technology and hence have wide applicability in different fusion reactors operating over a range of plasma density and magnetic field. The development of such a source will be essential for real time plasma monitoring in a commercial reactor. In the short term, such receivers will advance further development of this technique and methods at experiments such as the National Spherical Torus Experiment - Upgrade (NSTX-U)."

        "abstract": "Current high power gyrotrons for plasma heating use an internal launcher and multiple mirrors to generate a Gaussian output beam that exits the tube through a large diamond window. A Mirror Optical Unit (MOU) external to the gyrotron is required to transition the Gaussian beam into an HE11 mode in corrugated waveguide for transmission to tokamaks. The internal mirrors and large diamond window costs approximately $200K. The MOU costs approximately $350K to build with additional cost of $250K per year from lost RF power. A more cost effective and efficient approach is required for transitioning gyrotron power into transmission lines. Calabazas Creek Research Inc. (CCR) is proposing to transition the gyrotron RF power into corrugated waveguide inside the tube using an internal (direct) coupler. This eliminates internal mirrors costing approximately $80K and reduces the diamond window cost by approximately $100K. It also eliminates the MOU and its associated cost. The Phase I program will design, build, and test at low power a direct coupler for a MW-class, long-pulse gyrotron. The program will also design a compatible diamond output window and hardware to interface the coupler to an existing gyrotron. A complete design will be generated for installing the coupler into a gyrotron and testing at full power in the Phase II program."

        "abstract": "Welded stainless steel canisters that contain spent nuclear fuel (SNF) at near-marine sites have been found with salts on their outer surface that can produce an aggressive chemical environment that could lead to pitting, stress corrosion cracking (SCC), and potential release of radioactive materials. Welds that are most susceptible to SCC are difficult to reach because they are located inside the canister\u2019s concrete overpack with only a small air gap available for access.We propose to develop a process and device for mitigating potential SCC in dry storage canisters for SNF. The process will eliminate high residual tensile stresses in the heat-affected zones of the welds using a safe and benign process that will not affect the mechanical strength of the canister. The process will be administered by a small robotic device that can be inserted into the natural convection flow space between the canister and the overpack. In Phase I, we will optimize the mitigation process, use finite element analysis (FEA) for detailed evaluation of stresses near the weld, produce a conceptual design of the robotic mitigation device, and demonstrate the process using prototypical weld samples. We will optimize the process using phenomenological models of the weld treatment process combined with FEA. We will validate our models through proof-of-concept experiments on prototypical weld samples and post-treatment metallurgical analysis. Finally, we will produce a detailed concept design of the robotic device along with concepts of operation describing how the device will function in the field.Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: Creare\u2019s system will enable spent fuel storage facility operators to mitigate the effects of potential SCC. The benign process can be widely adopted and the compact, robotic device will be sized to enable treatment of canisters in all major commercial storage systems. Creare will sell mitigation systems to existing vendors of spent fuel canister maintenance systems as well as vendors of systems for strengthening welds in other large non-DSC structures."

        "abstract": "With the increasing application of renewables and other distributed energy resources, ground fault overvoltage and the protection become a concerned issue for Photovoltaic and other distributed energy resources interconnection. Generally, utilities require a protective relaying package 3V0 installed on the transformer high-voltage side to detect the ground fault overvoltage. This type of installation is costly in terms of money and construction timeline, which has become one of the main barriers to renewables and other distributed energy resources installation in NY State and other territories with similar grid circuit architecture. Applied Power Systems will work with Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and Island Technology to develop a low-cost alternative ground fault overvoltage protection device. It is a microprocessor based smart protection device to complete the ground fault overvoltage detection. Because it is installed on the low voltage side, the cost and construction timeline of the alternative ground fault overvoltage can be reduced greatly. In phase I the feasibility study of the alternative ground fault overvoltage protection will be completed. Applied Power Systems will be responsible for the feasibility study and conceptual design of the smart protection device hardware technology. Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute will complete the alternative ground fault overvoltage methodology and verification. The protection methodology and hardware development will be conducted under consulting with utility protection engineers from Island Technology. The typical application of the proposed the smart protection device is ground fault overvoltage protection for a delta\/wye (ground) substation transformer with distributed energy resources installed on the transformer wye (ground) side. It can reduce the cost of required ground fault overvoltage protection greatly, therefore facilitating renewables and other distributed energy resources interconnection and application. It is also potential to develop an alternative temporary overvoltage protection of modern power system, based on the methodology proposed in the document."

        "abstract": "Rechargeable lithium-ion batteries with low cost ($100\/kWh) and high energy density (500 Wh\/kg) are critically desired to meet the ever-increasing needs for energy. One way to achieve the goals is to enable lithium metal as the anode for lithium-ion batteries owing to its ultrahigh theoretical capacity (3,860 mAh\/g) and the high negative potential (-3.04 V vs. standard hydrogen electrode). However, the problems of lithium dendrite formation and low Coulombic efficiency (CE) during electrochemical cycling prevent the wide deployment of lithium anodes. In order to tackle the two problems of lithium anodes, researchers have pursued a number of strategies including electrolyte additives, solid polymer electrolyte and different coatings acted as artificial solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layers. Making artificial SEI layers is a most promising and effective strategy to enable the use of lithium anodes. In the proposal, ultrathin lithium will be used and advanced coatings will be prepared with excellent properties, including great mechanical strength, high dielectric constant and high lithium-ion conductivity, to greatly suppress lithium dendrites and stabilize the interface of the lithium\/electrolyte for ultrahigh CE. In Phase I, different advanced coatings will be directly prepared onto the ultrathin lithium metal. Such protected Li will be assessed in lithium-ion batteries and lithium-sulfur batteries (coin cells and pouch cells) at practical current rates for 300-400 cycles. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images for the cycled anodes will be taken to check if there is any dendrite formation."

        "abstract": "In this SBIR Phase I project, AccuStrata, Inc. will work with researchers at the University of South Carolina to create a high-throughput flame spray pyrolysis (FSP) system for the rapid, combinatorial discovery and optimization of heterogeneous catalysts. The proposed system will comprise three key features: (1) Optimization and operation of the high-throughput FSP system that is uniquely capable of creating Pd-CeO2-MnOx solid solution catalysts; (2) Integration of an in-situ laser induced breakdown spectroscopy system capable of monitoring the particle synthesis in real time; and (3) Development of an advanced machine learning algorithm that will utilize process parameters (flow rates, burner geometry, temperatures, precursor concentrations, etc.), in-situ laser induced breakdown spectroscopy measurements and post-synthesis characterization datato discover critical signatures within the emission spectra that can help narrow material search space and speed up materials discovery. The proposed system will integrate these features to provide a holistic, commercialize solution for combinatorial discovery of heterogeneous catalysts. A system with these unique capabilities will be of great interest to laboratories both at the university and industry levels. The SBIR proposal team will validate the approach by developing stable solid solution catalysts for natural gas combustion engines. Flame spray pyrolysis can be used to create catalysts from a wide array of materials. In addition, nanoparticle synthesis through FSP allows for precise control over crystallite size, crystalline phase, degree of aggregation and agglomeration, surface area and porosity, which makes it an ideal technique for heterogeneous catalysis discovery. While the technique provides incredible flexibility, complete characterization of the nanoparticles quality post-synthesis is often a slow process that hinders the discovery process. Laser induced breakdown spectroscopy is a processing in-situ technology for monitoring FSP but is an especially difficult characterization method due to the various emission lines originating from the fuel, precursors and by-products. The challenge of correlating the emission spectra to nanoparticle properties may be resolved using advance machine learning algorithms that can correlate the spectral response to the resulting nanoparticle properties as well as the processing parameters. Once the algorithm is trained, it can be used with real-time emission data as a prescreening so that only the most \u201cpromising\u201d candidates (as determined by the algorithm) will be flagged for further study. The goal of this SBIR phase I work will be to provide a proof-of-concept for the metrology and algorithms approach. Once the teams have validated the approach, a completely integrated system will be developed and commercialized in a subsequent phase II."

        "abstract": "Electromagnetic compatibility testing of digital instrumentation and control systems is often only performed while the systems are in operating mode(s) that are assumed to be the most susceptible to electromagnetic\/radio frequency interference. Experience in the nuclear industry has shown that this can lead to undetected faults in digital instrumentation and control systems. Performing electromagnetic compatibility testing at multiple operating modes would detect these faults, but the current state-of-the-art does not offer a means to achieve this level of comprehensive testing efficiently. This project proposes the design and development of a system that integrates electromagnetic compatibility and automated functional testing to enable comprehensive assessment and fault detection of digital instrumentation and control systems. The proposing firm will leverage its expertise in digital instrumentation and control qualification testing to conduct a hands-on research and development effort involving detailed electromagnetic\/radio frequency interference fault research, laboratory testing, and hardware\/software design. The initial step will be to research faults resulting from electromagnetic\/radio frequency interference in the nuclear and other industries. One or more devices that are susceptible to these faults will be selected for testing. Engineers at the proposing firm will then manually perform simultaneous functional and electromagnetic compatibility testing on the selected digital devices. This testing will illustrate the advantages of performing these types of tests simultaneously and will highlight the key challenges that an integrated system must overcome. This research will be used to establish requirements and create a conceptual design for a fully integrated testing system that will be developed in the Phase II effort. COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS AND OTHER BENEFITS: The product of this project will significantly streamline electromagnetic compatibility testing effort and give vendors and utilities more confidence in the robustness of their digital systems. This will enable the industry to replace more obsolete analog equipment and achieve the cost savings associated with upgrading to more modern digital systems. These benefits will be passed on to the public by improving the safety and minimizing the operational cost of nuclear power plants."

        "abstract": "This project proposes the development of carbon capture technology for flue gases using a new class of solid adsorbents. The novel adsorbents proposed here are anticipated of having a high CO2 removal capacity (0.4 g g-1) at wide temperature range and fast regeneration process. In this project, Advanced Energy Materials, LLC (AdEM) proposes to develop the high performance CO2 adsorbents based on lithium containing nanowire materials and also develop a scalable method for applying the adsorbents for industrial facilities. AdEM has developed a break-through technology for scalable manufacturing for one-dimensional metal oxides nanomaterials. Phase I of the proposed project involves three major components: (1) demonstrate the nanowire morphology of proposed CO2 adsorbents leads to high CO2 capture performance with good durability for different applications at multiple temperatures; (2) demonstrate the feasibility of the CO2 adsorption and regeneration processes continuously, and their integration with industrial facilities; (3) scale up the cost-effective production of adsorbents at kilogram scale, structure of porous powders to macroscopic shape adsorbent products with high mechanical strength and stability, and perform the technical validation. AdEM\u2019s proposed concept and its scalable manufacturing methods can lead to the highly efficient CO2 removal from stationary sources at wide temperature range."

        "abstract": "High brightness beams enable novel applications like x-ray free electron lasers and ultrafast electron microscopes. High brightness beams essentially consist of a large number of electrons in a small phase space volume, i.e. a high peak current. When such beams are generated from the cathode, there is a strong space charge force, which elongates the bunch and reduces its brightness. An optimal solution is to raise the accelerating voltage in the gun; however, the maximum gradient is limited by the effects of RF breakdown. The probability of RF breakdown is reduced as the RF pulse length decreases. We propose to develop an electron photo injector operating with short RF pulses. However, standing-wave cavities are inefficient to operate at short RF pulse lengths. For this reason, the proposed gun will consist of high peak gradient cathode half-cell with low loaded Q-factor, followed by a travelling-wave accelerating section, which is more efficient operating at short RF pulse lengths. In Phase I, we will design a gun prototype in X-band. This effort will include RF design, beam quality optimization, and engineering design. The design will be based on a short RF pulse generated at the Argonne Wakefield Accelerator Facility for two-beam acceleration experiments. We will manufacture an aluminum prototype to measure its microwave properties, most importantly, fill time. The proposed short RF pulse gun is an effective high gradient electron source fed by short RF pulses. These pulses can be formed by radar magnetrons with compact pulse compression systems that have a short delay line. The high brightness beam source can be used as the main beam in wakefield accelerators. It will find commercial applications in ultrafast electron diffraction and microscopy systems."

        "abstract": "Cellulosic nanomaterials exhibit great potential in various applications due to their unique properties. Additionally, abundant availability of feedstock has led to realization of industrial manufacturing of nanocellulose. Although in excess, a significant cost-limiting factor to utilize cellulosic nanomaterials, however, is separation of the nanomaterials from the suspensions in which they are grown. A need has been identified for technologies to enable solid-liquid separation associated with cellulosic nanomaterials production, \u201cas cellulosic nanomaterials are not economical to ship long distances while containing significant water content\u201d. This cost represents a critical driver for capital, energy, shipping, and resource costs of nanocellulose products. Interest has been expressed in the development of a technology for dewatering of cellulosic nanomaterials, which can be dried and redispersed without any changes in functional properties. The operation is anticipated to be one of the candidate electrochemical \u2018dewatering\u2019 technologies among ElectroDecomposition of water or ElectroConcentration. This program will investigate these electro-assisted dewatering technologies against performance constraints and develop individual cost models, including the candidate dewatering technology utilizing pulsed waveforms to achieve separation of cellulosic nanomaterials from its suspension. The cost models will be designed to interface with an overarching optimization tool, to identify a promising technology. A continuous-flow apparatus for a novel pulsed-waveform electro- chemical solids separation technology will be designed and constructed, and used to generate energy input and separation performance data. The proposed Phase I effort will demonstrate the feasibility of electrochemical dewatering of cellulosic nanomaterials, and elucidate the advantages of pulse reverse processing on properties and performance metrics, and development of a preliminary technology transition plan. This data will be incorporated along with literature data for other technologies into Excel- based cost analysis modules. These modules will in turn be integrated with a custom-developed optimization tool for screening promising dewatering technology with detailed cost analysis."

        "abstract": "A low-cost network of fueling stations is needed to see hydrogen fuel cell vehicles gain meaningful market share. According to the Department of Energy, the pre-cooling equipment accounts for about 15% of the cost of a fueling station. This cost could theoretically be eliminated if pre-cooling was no longer necessary. Currently, Type IV composite overwrap pressure vessels are used to store hydrogen on board the vehicle. Pre-cooling is needed to maintain the polymeric liner of these tanks under 85\uf0b0C as heat generated during the quick fill-up could compromise the structural integrity and impermeability to hydrogen of the liner. As a result, on-board hydrogen tanks of a new type or design are needed to enable the removal of the pre-cooling equipment from fueling stations. The proposer is armed with extensive experience with formulation, engineering and manufacturing of thermally-conductive materials for a variety of applications. In parallel, the proposer has established a strong relationship with a manufacturer of composite pressure vessels for the transportation industry. Combining the expertise of these two small businesses, the proposer will lead the effort to incorporate advanced materials currently available from its portfolio into the design and fabrication of thermally-conductive smart hydrogen tanks and reduce or eliminate the need for hydrogen pre-cooling. In Phase I, the thermally-conductive liner material will be manufactured and tested for strength, thermal conductivity and hydrogen permeability at the coupon level. A thermally-conductive overwrap will also be defined theoretically based on the proposer\u2019s existing carbon fiber-based products. In Phase II, the proposer plans to finalize material development and testing, then build a complete 700 bar tank with its manufacturing partner."

These networks are subject to failure due to the effects of naturally occurring or man-made electromagnetic pulses. Mitigation of these effects is necessary for the safety and security of our nation. Carbon nanotube based plasma limiters can provide a first line of defense against high energy pulses which are able to damage sensitive electronic circuits. Plasma limiters placed on the power and data lines into the control equipment can prevent the damaging pulses from reaching the semiconductor devices. During Phase I existing plasma limiter technology developed for RF systems in the Department of Defense will be modified to protect AC and DC power sources, data lines and sensor inputs which support the control networks of the electric grid. Modifications include new packaging to interface with each type of power supply, data interface and sensor input. Carbon nanotube geometry and the penning gas mixture which support the plasma formation will be altered to allow the limiter to activate at the proper overvoltage condition for the circuit being protected."

        "abstract": "While commercial, advanced optical transceivers can transmit data rates beyond 100Gb\/s, they will not function in the high radiation environment present at the High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC). These data transmission technologies are also too massive to be placed inside the HL-LHC detectors, where added mass degrades the measurements being made. The top custom-designed radiation-hardened optical transceivers that are available can work only up to the rate of 5.4Gb\/s. This is in sharp contrast to the hundreds of terabytes of data per second that a single HL-LHC sub-detector needs to transmit. Thus, custom-designed, radiation-hard and size-optimized optical transceivers are required that can transmit data at rates up to 100Gb\/s and beyond to meet the immediate HL-LHC need. Alphacore proposes to design 160 Gb\/s radiation-hardened optical transceivers for the HL-LHC based on the advanced PAM-4 transceiver architecture. The data rate for a single driver in Alphacore\u2019s unit transceiver will be 40Gb\/s, 7.4 times higher than the existing fastest radiation-hard transceivers, which is a significant improvement and provides a possible solution to the HL-LHC data transmission problems. Alphacore\u2019s unit transceivers can be combined to 160Gb\/s or larger transceiver modules (200Gb\/s). Alphacore will be teaming with the Unites States HL-LHC collaboration members in this R&amp;D program. The circuits will be designed in the same process CERN is using to make most of the circuits for HL-LHC, and they will meet the total ionizing dose (TID) requirements of the HL-LHC inner trackers (1Grad(Si)). Alphacore has been following CERN\u2019s TID test results for the proposed process and these results will be leveraged in this development. The ASIC will be also hardened against single event effects with techniques suggested in the recent CERN presentation on radiation effects and mitigation. The major circuits in this development include a 20GHz phased locked loop (PLL), a serializer and a laser driver that are all optimized for high data rate and extreme radiation hardness. The following tasks will be completed during the Phase I period: 1) Optimize the transceiver architecture, 2) Optimize the PLL architecture and complete its layout, 3) Optimize the current mode logic driver, 4) Design laser drivers, 5) Perform basic radiation effect simulations and apply RHBD techniques, 6) Integrate and complete the chip layout for the complete optical transceiver, and 7) Plan schedule and tasks for the Phase II program. The Phase I work will prepare the Alphacore team for prototype optimization, fabrication and evaluation which will occur during the Phase II program. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: The completed product will have wide applicability to the different sub-detector systems at HL-LHC. In addition, this rad-hard optical transceiver is versatile and can be used in numerous other HEP experiments (such as the International Linear Collider) and in large Nuclear Physics experiments, such as the planned Electron-Ion Collider (EIC)."

        "abstract": "Wet and gaseous waste streams are widely geographically distributed, frequently in areas of high population density, affording them unique market opportunities. Compared to terrestrial feedstocks, these waste streams are largely aggregated and any derivative biofuels, bioproducts, or biopower are close to end markets. Thus, various public and private entities are actively exploring and deploying novel solutions for waste stream valorization. Potential competition between biofuels, bioproducts, and other beneficial uses will likely be a key element of future markets, and clearly merits further analytical and modeling investigation. The need has been identified for the development of cheap, scalable and novel cell-free biomass conversion technology that produces biofuels \/ bioproducts, with enhanced carbon conversion efficiency. Interest has been expressed by the Department of Energy to develop novel biomass conversion strategy to substantially enhance the biomass carbon conversion efficiency. We will develop\/scale-up our bioelectrochemical conversion process to industrially feasible scales of at least 100 L, with increased overall carbon efficiency. The bioelectrochemical conversion process combines a biocatalytic step and an electrochemical step: rumen microbial consortia and Kolbe electrolysis, both of which make use of cheap renewable power to maximize carbon conversion efficiency of waste to biofuels. In Phase I, Faraday and IRI will use our combined expertise to scale the rumen bacteria reactor to produce adequate volumes of medium chain fatty acids for electrolytic conversion, while design and scale the electrolytic reactor in parallel to convert medium chain fatty acids to biofuels. Finally, we will prepare a first order techno-economic and life cycle analysis for the entire process from biomass to biofuels."

        "abstract": "FPoliSolutions (FPS) has an existing RISMC Commercialization Program being funded by a separate Phase-II DOE SBIR (DE-FOA-0001646 ,Topic C42-30f), whose mission is the development and commercialization of an integrated data\/simulation management framework which will enable a rapid introduction of Dynamic Probabilistic Risk Assessment (D-PRA) and Risk-Informed Safety Margin Characterization (RISMC) applications to nuclear power plants (NPP). As part of the RISMC Commercialization Program FPS\u2019s has been further developing the RAVEN technology for simulation management, limit surface studies, and Reduced Order Model (ROM) creation, and creating an enterprise system NX-Hub to streamline the deployment of these RISMC services.For this project, EMRALD will be integrated into FPS\u2019s NX-Hub as a service. EMRALD uses a state engine approach to provide the sequence and timing of events from state diagrams. This functionality will close a gap in the current RISMC Commercialization Program. FPS\u2019S current RISMC Program lacks the capability to quickly run through basic events, fault trees, and event trees (traditional PRA Artifacts) to determine the physics needed for simulations, and the timing\/sequence of the events to configure the simulations. This must be constructed manually by the user. EMRALD has the domain look and feel of traditional PRA, but enables introduction of D-PRA techniques, when integrated with NX-Hub EMRALD will drive RAVEN for the time- response physics simulator for events of interest. FPS will work with INL to create an interface with SAPHIRE to transition the traditional PRA artifacts of events, fault trees, and event trees into the D-PRA state diagrams.The current RISMC Program workflow uses NX-HUB as a database, with a browser-based user interface that can run tens of thousands of simulations, with multiple simulators once the event sequence and times has been input (RELAP5-3D, and others) to support NPP safety analysis. The workflow is very efficient and lean with regard to parameter, file, data management, and RAVEN simulation interfacing. With EMRALD integration the user will be able to manage plant parameter data needed for analysis, down-select scenarios or plant configurations that require an actual time-response simulation and perform the simulation through RAVEN services that will run RELAP5-3D or other simulators.PS\u2019s RISMC Commercialization Program is strongly supported by US nuclear utilities, whose input to steers the near- and mid- term development objectives. Throughout Phase I\/Phase II of the RISMC Commercialization Program FPS had workshops for requirements gathering and demos with three utilities and one vendor to expose NX-Hub concepts to gather support and commercialization feedback. FPS will repeat this with the EMRALD project, to foster utility participation and ensure EMRALD commercialization after Phase-III. One US nuclear utility has already pledged support for this project, with more sure to follow.In Phase-I, FPS will focus on learning the details of technology implemented in EMRALD and developing a prototype that will demonstrate feasibility. This demo will be given to the utilities participating in FPS RISMC program and therefore plant the seed for future commercial application. EMRALD integration as a service to NX-HUB will streamline commercial deployment and provide utility exposure."

        "abstract": "Decisions made early in the schematic design of buildings can have significant energy impacts that the architect probably did not even consider during the decision-making process. The decision-making process is probably more focused on space locations and overall look of the building than any other criteria. This proposed SBIR project hopes to insert an understanding of the energy impacts into this fluid and flexible part of the design process so that decisions that are made provide for the most energy-efficient buildings as possible. The project will create a web-based simulation system tailored toward architects during this very early stage in the design. Unlike tools such as Sefaira, Revit, or AECOsim, this web-based approach will not require any drawing of the building. Instead, the main inputs will be the size of each type of space in the building. The software will use this information along with the proposed building location and site boundary lines to show a variety of possible configurations and the energy impact of each. Each general configuration will be shown with a variety of measures including daylighting controls, natural ventilation, passive strategies, and a range of space locations within the buildings. The objectives of the proposed Phase I effort are: (1) To develop an initial algorithm and software that takes the architectural planning information and creates detailed building energy model descriptions; and (2) Test if the information provided by the software could provide useful energy information to the architect."

        "abstract": "A successful algal industry would be transformative in the US. The very high productivity of algae relative to land plants will drive massive job creation in rural areas, provide biofuel and biopolymers to reduce dependence on foreign sources of oil, reduce fertilizer run-off with its corresponding water quality impairment, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and enable use of currently underutilized land and saline water resources for food and fuel production. Overall, the forty-fold increase in agricultural productivity will result in an economic boon for the US and a sustainable way to meet the world\u2019s growing protein and energy needs. A more efficient, lower cost harvesting technology will contribute directly to the US Department of Energy\u2019s goals as laid out the 2016 BioEnergy Technologies Office Multi-Year Program Plan, which recognizes \u201cOptimizing harvesting operations is critical to maximizing algal biomass yields while ensuring sustainability of the production system.\u201d and identifies \u201cSustainable Harvesting\u201d as a key technical barrier because \u201cCurrent algal biomass harvesting and dewatering technologies are costly and energy- and resource- intensive.\u201d In phase 1, we will evaluate the potential for operation and integration of a Zobi system with several other unit operations to attain an integrated harvest system that: (1) is universally applicable to any microalgae; (2) is scalable to harvest rates of 100\u2019s of MGD; (3) does not require addition of expensive flocculants or other chemicals; (4) attains greater than 99% capture of algae in the harvest stream; (5) achieves a 90% or greater reduction in energy demand relative to DAF\/centrifuges; (6) attains a 30% reduction in capital costs relative to DAF\/centrifuges; and (7) concentrates algae from pond concentration to 20-30% solids content. By facilitating a commercial algal biofuel and commercial algal protein industry this project will directly benefit rural communities by creating many high-quality jobs in rural areas through the higher productivity per area and per amount of water used, and through the use of currently underutilized land and water resources. The entire US public will benefit from the economic boon created by much high productivity from land and water resources. The public will also benefit from the environmental benefits of reducing agricultural chemical run-off, reducing water requirements for food and biofuel production, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and reducing pressure to convert forests or other valuable land resources to food and fuel production."

        "abstract": "Lightning strikes and near-strikes on wind turbine blades cost wind farm operators millions of dollars every year, representing one of their largest O&amp;M risks and expenses, as well as a primary cause of turbine downtime (resulting in lost power production). These negative effects increase the levelized cost of wind energy. With the incidence of lightning strikes increasing as turbines get larger, improved lightning mitigation strategies are necessary to better control lightning effects on future machines. An innovative metal oxide gelcoat additive will be developed to work in conjunction with the traditional wind turbine lightning protection systems that includes lightning receptors near the tips and a large down conductor connected to ground. The material will minimize static charge buildup on the interior and exterior of the blade, reducing the gradual damage currently caused by frequent near-strikes. The new coating will encourage lightning attachment at the intended disk receptors, reducing the likelihood of blade punctures due to direct strikes. In this project, an innovative semi-conductive surface coating will be developed and demonstrated for reducing the damaging effects of lightning strikes and near- strikes on wind turbine blades. In step one, the physical characteristics of the surface coating will be investigated in a controlled laboratory environment. In step two, the ability of the coating to negate static charge buildup on representative blade materials will be tested along with multiple application methods of the coating. In step three, large-scale, high voltage experimental lightning testing will be conducted to demonstrate the benefits of static charge reduction and manipulating lightning attachment processes on a realistic blade shape."

        "abstract": "There is currently a lack of condition monitoring tools for electrical and instrumentation &amp; control equipment. When this equipment (or subcomponents) fails in nuclear power plants, it is often considered to be a random occurrence because the impending failure was not detectable using walk downs or surveillance testing and the internal status indicators of the equipment showed everything was operational. Early identification of equipment or component degradation could allow for repair or replacement prior to a complete system failure. Each piece of electrical\/electronic equipment emits a unique electromagnetic emission signature which can be correlated to the health or condition of the equipment. Identifying and understanding the subtle changes in the electromagnetic signature is key to detecting degrading components prior to equipment failure. Under this project, electrical and instrumentation &amp; control equipment that experiences a high rate of failure will be artificially degraded in a simulated plant electromagnetic environment. The emission signatures from this equipment will be measured, recorded, and correlated to the health or condition of the equipment. The goal of this effort is to establish the basis for automated analysis of the emission signatures. This effort will result in development of a condition monitoring tool kit that will allow for the identification of degrading components prior to equipment failure. COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS AND OTHER BENEFITS:By employing the proposed system, nuclear plant operators will be able to more proactively maintain their electrical and instrumentation &amp; control equipment, improve plant safety, reduce risks to operation, and limit the number and duration of unplanned shutdowns. In addition, digital instrumentation &amp; control components may gain wider adoption in the nuclear industry if measures are in place to help ensure their reliability. These benefits will help make the existing fleet of nuclear reactors more competitive and add to the prosperity of next generation nuclear reactors."

One major problem is that magnets wound from high-temperature superconductors are very difficult to protect when a local hotspot develops somewhere in the magnet cable. There are currently no practical methods to detect a local hotspot in time to power down the magnet. This proposal seeks to develop high-temperature superconducting magnet cables that contain optical fibers able to detect very small local hotspots in the cable as soon as they occur. These cables and their ability to detect quenches will result in a much safer operation of large magnet systems made from high-temperature superconductors. During Phase I, we will determine the feasibility of incorporating optical fibers in high-temperature superconducting cables without damaging them. We will test the ability of the fiber to detect a local hotspot in the cable."

        "abstract": "Despite all of the advantages that electric vehicles bring, better battery performance remains a requirement of widespread commercial adoption. Areas of specific interest include improved specific energy and energy density coupled with improved manufacturing processes which reduce costs and increase throughputs. This project aims to demonstrate a unique processing method, freeze tape casting, which is applicable an array of anode and cathode materials. The process is derived from traditional tape casting which speaks to commercial viability but produces entirely unique microstructures which impart important functional advantages to the battery. These advantages ultimately manifest as improvements in specific energy and energy density. In this project, the freeze tape casting technique will be applied to relevant materials for the production of a solid-state lithium ion demonstration cell. This project will provide proof of concept for this specialized processing approach as well as preliminary performance characterization from the subject cell. These results will further provide the basis for Phase II collaboration with established battery developers with whom active discussion is already occurring. Within Phase I formulations for freeze tape casting of the anode and cathode materials will be developed, prototype electrodes will be produced, complete cells assembled, and electrochemical characterization performed. The outcome of the proposed work is two-fold. First, the project will have demonstrated a novel, high-performance solid state, battery architecture. Second, the project will have provided an important basis in the freeze tape casting battery electrodes which will enable the company to provide technical services and freeze tape casting equipment to battery developers with an enhanced technical knowledge base. This commercial application will be of interest to developers of electric vehicle drive batteries and beyond."

        "abstract": "GeoMechanics Technologies proposes to evaluate the application of hydroshearing as an innovative method to enhance the delivery of treatment amendments in complex geology. The process of hydroshearing involves the injection of fluid into the subsurface at an adequate pressure that will open up natural existing fractures in the rock, without initiating new tensile fractures. This method of subsurface permeability enhancement has been readily applied in the geothermal industry to improve the circulation of fluids in hot, dry rock for economic production. In the same way, hydroshearing can also be useful for environmental management as a novel method to increase the spatial distribution and delivery of treatment amendments in hard naturally fractured rock. The specific technical objectives for this Phase I research and development effort are as follows: (1) Building and expanding on our own and others\u2019 past theoretical work to develop analytical descriptions of hydroshearing failure and its effect on increasing permeability; (2) Develop and document a numerical simulation workflow of optimized injection to establish the hydroshearing process; (3) Apply numerical modeling to consider various complex geological structures in fractured crystalline rock (formation dips, faults, and heterogeneity in geomechanical parameters); and (4) Analyze the efficiency of hydroshearing for environmental remediation and conduct a preliminary economic analysis. Successful development and demonstration of this new technique will provide better clean-up of contaminants caught in the fractures within the rock formation, leading to more efficient clean- up of legacy wastes. Improved remediation techniques will reduce health hazards to humans and the environment, while better protecting Underground Sources of Drinking Water (USDW)."

        "abstract": "The Department of Energy (DOE) is seeking the development of an advanced transparent conductive film for solid-state lighting, especially for organic light emitting diode (OLED) anode applications. Currently, the most dominant choice is indium tin oxide (ITO) based transparent conductive film (TCF). However, these films suffer from high cost, high processing temperature, low stability and poor flexibility and cannot satisfy the fast growth of OLED SSL. During the proposed project, the company will develop a Nanomaterials-Enabled Transparent Conductive Film based on a composite structure of carbon nanomaterials and inorganic nanoparticles. Overall, the proposed film will have low sheet resistance, high transmittance, excellent mechanical strength and flexibility, good stability for long term operation and compatibility with industrial manufacture processes. It will not only address DOE\u2019s need and replace ITO as the OLED anode for SSL applications, but also promote other areas of DOE interest, such as OLED displays, organic photovoltaics, touch screens, and wearable devices. In Phase I, we will: (1) develop the composite materials; (2) fabricate and characterize the film, and demonstrate its feasibility for OLED anode applications; and (3) preliminarily assess the technical and economic feasibility of this nanomaterial-based transparent conductive film for meeting DOE final goals."

        "abstract": "Annually, building consumes about 40% of total energy in the United States, greater than industrial and transportation. High-performance thermal insulation technologies for retrofitting existing building is urgently need to further improve its energy efficiency. The overall research objective for SBIR phase I is to demonstrate scalable thermal insulating nanowood with optimized thermal and mechanical properties suitable for energy efficiency building retrofit applications. We will have four tasks including: (1) develop and optimize delignification process to achieve nanowood with engineered nanopores; (2) investigate various properties of nanowood such as mechanical strength and toughness, thermal conductivity (resistance), UV and environmental stability, and fire resistance; (3) carry out cost analysis and investigate scale up manufacturing; and (4) evaluate the potential commercialization of the thermal insulating white wood. Note that the thermal properties of nanowood can be modulated by carefully tuning the pore size of the material, as discussed in our preliminary result (Anisotropic, lightweight, strong, and super thermally insulating nanowood with naturally aligned nanocellulose, Science Advanced, Accepted). We already demonstrated that nanowood with mesopores can deliver a low thermal conductivity of ~0.025 W\/mK, which needs to be further improved for the R-12 target. We will also collaborate with Dr. J.Y. Zhu in Forest Product Lab in Task 1 for wood characterizations and R-50 for potential commercialization evaluations in Task 4. We will continue working with Cardolite Spatiality Chemicals on polymer treatments of delignified wood for enhancing the environmental stabilities. If the project is extended to Phase II, Phase III and beyond with success, the proposed nanowood insulation technology will be able to be adopted for a range of thermal insulation applications. For example, the low- cost, lightweight, strong and super insulating nanowood can be added to walls of existing buildings with a simple payback period for retrofit projects ideally less than 5 years but no more than 10 years."

        "abstract": "The Department of Energy (DOE) views the utilization of wet organic waste, such as food and beverage wastewater, to produce high value bioproducts as a strategic approach to the development of an advanced and sustainable economy. Wet organic waste treatment currently places a significant burden on producers but represents a potential 77 million metric ton per year feedstock. However, wet organic waste is often produced at distributed locations, with varying composition, and can be resource intensive to treat. There is a vital need to develop new technologies that are robust at varying scales and sufficiently flexible to treat a variety of different streams efficiently and effectively. The DOE is helping to develop novel methods of conversion that goes beyond simply handling waste,that use novel methods of conversion and produce high value byproducts during the treatment process. Emergy Labs is developing an engineered system using fungi as a biocatalyst for the efficient conversion of organic industrial wastewater, such as brewery wastewater, to high value biomaterials for filtration and separation applications. Using well developed submerged fungal fermentation and thermochemical processes, a novel conversion method is presented to simultaneously decontaminate brewery wastewater by over 80% and convert biogenic carbon into a patent pending, high performance, porous carbon material. This high value material can serve as a solid filtration media for a wide variety of industrial applications and has a shown a nearly 250% increase in performance over conventionally used materials. This DOE STTR Phase I is critical to optimize the downstream processes of the proposed fungal biorefinery for simultaneous wastewater treatment and domestic production of an advanced material. The work being done includes the investigation of industrial equipment for optimal mechanical dewatering. Forming equipment will be studied to produce industrial applicable granules to expand potential applications. The final material will be tested using industry standards to provide confidence of consistency and reproducibility. This work is critical to meet relevant scales of waste treatment\/product production and position Emergy Labs to deploy the technology without delay."

        "abstract": "Energy Analytics will develop an integrated workflow and set of related tools and processes addressing the time intensive nature of performing energy model validation and calibration in Measurement &amp; Verification practice and in constructing Investment Grade energy models for use in Energy Performance Contract (EPC) feasibility assessment and proposal development. Both of these commercial practices require accurate integration of actual utility use and cost with detailed building systems models for the purpose of achieving reliable predictive representation of operating buildings. In the case of M&amp;V practice, the validated model is often used to verify that predicted energy savings for new construction and green building certification have been achieved in the completed and occupied facility. When actual and expected utility use and cost do not agree, the validated model can serve as a basis for systems diagnostics and remediation.In the case of EPC proposal development for existing buildings, historical utility billing data is combined with site audits and an appropriate level of modeling to perform energy measures studies to quantify cost, benefit and return on investment for specific measures. On the basis of the modeling and projected benefits, a long-term contract may then be defined involving significant capital investment with expected energy use and cost savings to the building owner and financial returns to the EPC firm. An extension and application of this overall approach is related to current urgent focus on resiliency and opportunities to integrate sets of buildings included in municipal or campus critical infrastructure into assured power microgrids capable of withstanding extended grid outages. Many states are currently sponsoring programs and providing grants to support design and development of microgrids, particularly in the Northeast following the impact of a number of recent \u201csuperstorms.\u201d During Phase 1, Energy Analytics LLC will develop and demonstrate critical processes and tools and will implement interfaces to the OpenStudio platform and other external modeling tools.The focus of this proposed development is to automate manual methods and processes used in current consulting practice that will allow streamlined entry of baseline utility use and cost data, rapid and automated creation of accurate full resolution energy systems models including representative end use disaggregation and for microgrid and CHP applications, seamless interface to tools related to on-site energy production systems analysis."

        "abstract": "Consumers want more choice in their ability to buy energy which has been produced by alternative sources such as solar power without the interaction of a third party. Meanwhile, the utilities which maintain the grid must know how much power is within their system. A network where energy transactions can be distributed anonymously and reconciled by any member of the network is desired. A smart-meter-based peer-to-peer transaction network for solar prosumer to consumer energy transactions will be developed around a patented, tested smart meter. Many parameters associated with this type of transaction network will be measured or estimated based on test data including: optimum peer to peer transaction and cryptocurrency algorithms, transparency between network members and estimation of scalability. The purpose of Phase I then is to show that this type of smart meter provides critical infrastructure for peer-to-peer energy transactions between solar prosumers and consumers. A market analysis will be performed using these type of transactions and a commercialization plan produced along with transaction costs. Various peer-to-peer transaction and cryptocurrency algorithms will be examined with the goals of optimizing scalability, and ensuring transparency between network members. Decreased connection and transaction time due to the smart meter\u2019s high-bandwidth will be demonstrated as well as the cybersecurity.Load-shifting algorithms will be investigated to determine optimum load-shifting. Demonstrations of connections to various environmental and electrical sensors will be performed. During Phase I the efficacy of the chosen smart meter as a trusted peer-to-peer transaction agent will be demonstrated. Tests of the security, transparency and other required parameters discussed above will be performed. The focus of Phase II will be finalizing smart meter components, optimizing and upgrade software, and developing a commercial prototype."

        "abstract": "Incumbent routes to myriad high-value chemicals require energy-intensive manufacturing practices that are hazardous to human health and the environment, and non-renewable petrochemical feedstocks. Existing plant biomass conversion technologies in biofuel and bioproduct manufacturing are largely inefficient, preventing industrial scale-up of drop-in replacements and deployment for mass consumption. Lygos, Inc. proposes to develop a microbial catalyst that converts 100% renewable plant sugars into a ubiquitous, high-value bioproduct via a highly efficient biosynthetic pathway, thereby significantly increasing the land\u2019s effective product yield. (We cannot disclose the bioproduct due to the non- confidential nature of this summary.) Our proposed pathway further comprises CO2 sequestration, which increases theoretical yield of the bioproduct to &gt;100%. We envision a bolt-on production facility co-located with cellulosic sugars and ethanol biofuel production. We anticipate upcycling waste CO2, thereby reducing industrial greenhouse gas emissions. Based on our techno-economic calculations, because the bio-product is more valuable than bio-ethanol, commercialization of the proposed technology in an integrated biorefinery can decrease biofuel production costs to &lt; $3\/GGE, thereby improving the economics of the overall facility. In this Phase I proposal, we plan to develop a prototype production strain capable of &gt;5% bioproduct yield from cellulosic glucose and CO2. In summary, we plan to generate strain libraries comprising enzymes that constitute the pathway, and engineer strains towards improved pathway activity and yield. With in-house capability to construct 200 unique strains per month, we are able to carry out the work plan in the Phase I time period. By leveraging previous successes in bringing bio-malonic acid to market, we believe that a 5% yield provides sufficient demonstration of technical feasibility to de-risk the pathway enzymes. We anticipate Phase I results to enable a Phase II work plan that includes manufacturing at a 100-liter scale with established partners such as the DOE-funded Advanced Biofuels Process Development Unit. If the project is successful, we anticipate bringing to market a drop-in bio- product with a green, cost-advantaged process in a global market estimated to exceed $400MM."

        "abstract": "The growth in renewable energy and the inherent distributed nature of these sources is challenging the electric grid, calling for modernization to a more intelligent, reconfigurable distribution system. It is well understood that with greater use of distributed energy sources, which can result in significant- even reverse power flows, smart protective relaying technologies become essential for safe and reliable grid operation. The proposed project will demonstrate a bi-modal fiber optic distributed temperature and acoustic sensor for monitoring both parameters in high voltage distribution cables. This will allow fast detection and location of ground faults, and real-time monitoring of cable conductor temperature to assess dynamic cable rating- critical information for smart protective relaying to enhance grid resiliency and power restoration in the event of a supply interruption. When incorporated within power cable sheathing, the all di-electric construction of optical fibers has no impact on performance of these cables while allowing direct measurement of the conductor with no interference. This project will demonstrate a bimodal distributed temperature and acoustic sensor capable of complete monitoring of these parameters over the entire length of cable. An optical test cable incorporating a pair of conventional telecommunications-grade fibers will be used for the project demonstration, and available for any \u201clive\u201d high-voltage cable tests. A commercial Raman-scatter type distributed temperature instrument will be used to monitor cable\/conductor temperature. Such fiber optic sensors have been demonstrated in this application with good results, however the measurement time is not adequate to quickly detect rapid thermal events or mechanical disturbances associated with ground faults. The main development of this project will be a distributed acoustic\/vibration sensor capable of almost instantaneous detection and location of disturbances acting on the cable due to ground faults. This sensor detects sudden changes in light propagation in the sensor fiber and applies a fast auto-correlation method to determine its location. The proposed bimodal sensor will deliver critical information for advanced protective relaying control systems, providing real-time intelligence at the physical layer of the grid. The high-speed disturbance sensor innovation has other commercial applications in physical security, pipeline monitoring, and transportation infrastructure safety and integrity."

        "abstract": "The US Department of Energy\u2019s Nuclear Energy Advanced Modeling and Simulation (NEAMS) Toolkit has accelerated both the solutions to existing problems and deployment of new designs for current and advanced reactors. Within the toolkit, there exist various families of simulation tools that target specific aspects of a multi-physics simulation for a nuclear reactor. Tools within a specific family vary in both complexity and fidelity as well as the types of resources they require. To complement the NEAMS effort, the Computational Model Builder (CMB) has been designed to provide a graphical user interface to design and execute nuclear reactor workflows.Our proposal focuses on managing simulation families that are used in defining multiphysics workflows for advanced nuclear reactor simulations. The proposed work is well-suited to CMB\u2019s design philosophy, which currently provides tools to describe workflow tasks with user-selectable levels of granularity; in a similar fashion, a task description for a simulation family would pro- vide a core input specification and adaptively present additional information depending on the specific task the user selects within the family. During Phase I, Kitware will develop the following:An intuitive GUI-based workflow infrastructure for CMB that is tailored for the simulation families of tools that exist in the NEAMS Toolkit that can then later be integrated into NEAMS Workbench.A proof of concept on the workflow infrastructure by defining a neutronics simulation based on DIF3D and transitioning it to use Proteus. Visualization of the results of the simulation. Throughout this project, we will be interacting with NEAMS Workbench developers as well as eliciting feedback from end-users and other developers from NEAMS and the nuclear industry, which will guide our efforts. All the software developed in this project will be available under a liberal open-source license.Commercial applications &amp; other benefits: This work will further develop our open-source platform for modeling and simulation workflow. Such a platform provides Kitware with significant business opportunities, as open software platforms lend themselves to a services business model where we can provide technology integration services with customers and collaborators to build valuable, competitive products and services."

        "abstract": "Today\u2019s building energy modeling practice is highly fractured between different simulation engines, Computer Aided Design (CAD) interfaces, and web resources. While preferences for these fractured components vary between professions and individuals, one principle is nearly unanimously agreed upon: a strong, flexible connection between these three categories of software is needed if the building industry is to reach the full potential of building energy modeling. We will develop a web-based, cloud-integrated application that links existing popular 3D modeling environments to several validated simulation engines, including EnergyPlus\/OpenStudio, Radiance, and OpenFOAM. This platform will provide new web-based workflows and will couple whole building energy simulation with daylight and detailed airflow simulation as specified in topic 9c for whole-building energy modeling. Phase I will involve developing core libraries for radiation, solar access, point-in-time daylight and annual daylight, the development of an Application Programming Interface (API) for this core, and setting up a secure server to host these services. Studies will be performed to identify critical inputs to be exposed in API and research into the most appropriate and economical cloud computing resources will be conducted. Following Phase I, resources for full-building energy modeling and computational fluid dynamics will be integrated. The fully-integrated API will not only allow these two types of simulations to tap into cloud computing resources but will also enable new types of studies that cannot be achieved with individual engines, including annual thermal comfort mapping, shade benefit analyses, and augmented heating\/cooling system sizing. Not only do the full set of cloud services represent significant commercial value but the integrated, open source API and CAD plugins that are being produced to enable the services yield a substantial public benefit. Specifically, the CAD plugins will permit the running of free simulations locally on desktop computers and will enable many individuals to run simulations who might not otherwise be able to do so. Furthermore, the open source API will allow other software engineers to develop new applications that are not specifically related to cloud computing on top of the work of this project."

        "abstract": "Additive manufacturing, such as laser sintering or melting of additive layers can produce parts rapidly at small volume and in a factory setting. To make the parts nuclear quality, a real-time non-destructive evaluation (NDE) technique is required to detect defects while they are being manufactured. The proposed NDE technique is a feasibility study of an optical sensor unit that is incorporated in a direct laser sintering machine to capture defects in real-time. The sensor data can be used to identify defects as they occur such that immediate corrective action can be taken. It also provides parameters that enable the prediction if the part is of nuclear quality.The proposed work will be a multi-parameter sensing approach, incorporating multiple optical sensing and imaging techniques. The apparatus will be incorporated in a 3D metal printing machine. The final outputs of the sensors will be combined to produce a defect map in real-time as the part is being printed. Defects such as voids improper melting, bulging of the metal, and out-of-spec prints will be revealed.During Phase I, the feasibility of the proposed multi- parameter NDE approach will be demonstrated using a combination of theory and experiments. Samples with representative defects that occur during additive manufacturing of metal parts will be prepared and tested to demonstrate the ability and effectiveness of the proposed approach. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: When this NDE technology is commercialized by carrying over to Phase II and Phase III, the sensor unit will be incorporated in the 3D printing machines without requiring design changes to the machine. The unit will detect printing defects in real-time. The sensor data will be utilized to pre-qualify parts for nuclear quality, and therefore minimize or eliminate the need for post fabrication testing. The economic benefits include reduction of cost of post-process testing, and significant reduction of loss of labor and material due to faulty parts. DOE and other branches of the government will benefit by streamlining the nuclear parts manufacturing. The reduced cost of manufacturing will help transition to modern nuclear energy, which will benefit the public by providing safe and cost effective energy solution. Other applications include NDE for manufacturing parts for the aerospace industry."

        "abstract": "Storage of hydrogen is challenging due to high storage pressures and potential for hydrogen embrittlement. Frequent inspections of storage vessels are required to ensure safety but available technologies are unable to detect features on the micrometer scale that can influence remaining useful life. There exists a need for a system that can resolve micrometer scale features and relate these to the remaining useful life of infrastructure. Luna proposes develop an inspection system that leverages nonlinear interactions between two mixed acoustic waves to identify the presence of micrometer flaws in steel. The development effort will focus on EMAT technology to allow non-contact inspections and rapid surface scanning. During Phase I the feasibility of identifying micrometer-scale flaws in steel alloys using non- collinear wave mixing will be demonstrated using a breadboard system. This demonstration will include measurement techniques, transducer assemblies, and analytical routines that will transition to the Phase II system. A library of samples of two different steel alloys with seeded flaws will be produced and inspected using both conventional techniques and novel wave- mixing techniques. As part of the development effort, we will investigate the potential of single transducer probes as well as phased array probes in order to guide the direction of the Phase II architecture. Plans for the Phase II architecture and for verification and validation activities will during Phase II will be addressed."

        "abstract": "Dispatchable generation refers to sources of electricity that can be turned on or off, or can adjust their power output accordingly to an order. Geothermal plants are usually used for base-load power rather than dispatchable power. The 8 MW Puna Expansion Facility in Hawaii is the first fully dispatchable geothermal power plant (Nordquist et al., GRC Transactions, Vol. 37, 2013). As described by the Ormat team, the adaptation of a base load power plant to full dispatchability was not easy. The plant is required to adjust its power output quickly in response to a requested ramp rate and maintain its frequency within close tolerance to the grid power. This was a challenge for a geothermal plant because the heat source does not naturally respond quickly to changes in demand. To address this challenge, Ormat decided to maintain the geothermal fluid flows at relatively steady rates while providing a bypass around the generation equipment as needed. Under part load, some of the geothermal fluid is pumped to the surface, bypasses the generation equipment, and is re-injected to the ground without extracting any useful enthalpy. This approach is robust but necessarily incurs high parasitic power draws at part load due to the constant, full-flow pumping power requirements. As an improvement to this existing configuration of a dispatchable geothermal plant, we propose to include a phase-change thermal energy storage (TES) unit that will provide some \u201cinertia\u201d against temperature fluctuations. The TES phase change material (PCM) could be in the form of eutectic molten salts or the like based on the required temperature. This configuration would allow the power plant to meet the ramp rate requirements while allowing the geothermal resource to respond more slowly. As a result, the geothermal fluid flow rates could be modulated to reduce pumping power at part load. In Phase I, Mainstream would design, build and test the TES component. Cornell University would perform the techno-economic analysis (TEA). In Phase II, the team would integrate the PCM TES into a test loop that mimics a sub-scale geothermal power plant with realistic, simulated geothermal resource time response. This hardware testing will allow the configuration to be proved out under various dynamic dispatchable use cases (e.g., load matching). Cornell has plans to become a net-zero campus and geothermal heat and power is a critical component of that plan. As such, Cornell would provide an ideal \u201cliving laboratory\u201d for a dispatchable, campus power supply."

        "abstract": "As new commercial applications arise for supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO2) power generation, and higher efficiencies are achieved through higher turbine inlet pressures and temperatures, the need to advance technologies on the component level becomes essential. Power cycles using sCO2 as the working fluid are gaining increasing interest as reductions in CO2 emissions from power plants are sought and alternate energy sources are investigated. To increase efficiency, and ultimately to make them economically viable, these systems require very high turbine inlet temperatures and pressures, posing an interesting challenge to rotor system sealing. This grant application seeks to develop a high-performance dry gas seal to meet the sCO2 environment outlined in this solicitation. The proposed concept combines the best features of current dry gas seal technology with specific design enhancements and material combinations that will provide effective sealing and long service life under these extreme conditions. To achieve the project objective, MSI will combine best-in-class technologies in non-contacting, upstream-pumping seals, non-contacting bushing-type seals, and the latest in high temperature materials and coatings to produce a high performance dry gas seal design suitable for low maintenance long-term operation in advanced sCO2 power cycles.In Phase I, MSI will design its unique innovative seal and use its extensive library of computer codes, and seal system experience to create a comprehensive, realistic, multi-physics model of the seal design and its environment. The seal component parts will be individually evaluated to optimize the designs and materials, and then combined together in a high- fidelity computer model that will predict the performance of the entire assembly as a system. Interfacial materials and coatings will be selected for optimum service and start-stop wear resistance. Commercial Application and Other Benefits: MSI\u2019s proposed effort supports both commercial and federal interests. High performance (high temperature, high pressure, high surface speed) seals can be an enabling technology in that they allow effective operation of machines that otherwise would leak internally or externally too much to be practical in sCO2 applications. MSI anticipates applications in both sCO2 and other high pressure and temperature critical shaft sealing situations ranging from turbines and process gas compressors and generator hydrogen (H2) seals in electric power generators. Advancing sCO2 power cycle machinery will allow them to become more efficient and ultimately more economical, thereby increasing their potential to penetrate the marketplace."

        "abstract": "The nuclear power industry, including the 61 commercially operating nuclear power plants with 99 nuclear reactors, and research and test reactors, is undergoing a transition from analog to digital control systems (A2D). While the A2D transition will enhance efficient operation of nuclear reactors, it also introduces cybersecurity concerns related to their safe and cost-effective operation. Insider threats, supply chain management, susceptibility to direct network breach are emerging as recognized concerns in the reactor community as security budgets are an average $10 mm per plant per year.At the same time, there is little unified methodology for assessing the full range risks of vulnerabilities in a digitized reactor domain. Facility safety and security currently often hinge on a catalog of approved parts, with a rudimentary binning and ranking process carrying little fidelity around the impact on A2D transition risks to mission-critical assets. The loss impact could be significant if an operator cannot distinguish the risk impact of changing a low criticality part from accrediting a critical part.Neo Prime proposes to develop a risk-informed approach to the digital transition of the nuclear plants. Neo Prime will extend its patented risk simulation and modeling approach, which is already providing guidance to non-nuclear generation, and extend it to commercial application in the nuclear sector. This will promote design and implementation of secure architectures to reduce risk to mission critical reactor assets, prioritize cost-effective security control deployment and advanced reporting. This framework allows enterprise risk evaluation of resiliency of nuclear facility security planning and implementation, and informs requirements that should be placed on manufacturers of critical digital equipment. Phase I design of a dynamic threat model against nuclear utility components and damage pathways will extend Design Basis Threat analysis to include the latest ICS threats, e.g., US CERT TA17-163A Crash Override. NRC Regulations will be fully incorporated into a stochastic risk-based model of reactor operations, with multiple Neo Prime components focusing on threat groups and attack tactics, the security control measures for insider threat, supply chain security, and A2D transition scenarios, while developing a risk model for safety, security and maintenance. The Phase I risk model will inform decision-making, training and exercising, including cooperative tests with Neo Prime\u2019s current client base. Phase II will focus on extending the Neo Prime RiskFirst platform for automated data entry, risk reporting, alert notifications and security control tracking to allow reactor leadership and security teams to track progress on their cost-effective mitigation strategies, and allow managers to plan and track implementation for safe A2D reactor transitions. Phase II will include the design of a comprehensive simulation and security training regime to protect nuclear facilities via the modified RiskFirst platform."

        "abstract": "There is a lack of software tools for rapid, accurate, and cost-effective building energy modeling and simulation. While some platforms for energy modeling exist, they do not openly integrate with other systems and are not structured for supporting portfolio-scale energy efficiency (EE) program management and modeling. As a result, cities, utilities, and private organizations are limited in their ability to cost-effectively develop and manage portfolio-level building improvement and investment strategies. The lack of integrated tools is significantly hindering the wide-scale adoption of energy efficiency technologies across the United States. Establishing an open portfolio management platform with a next-generation building modeling and simulation engine that connects with external systems will unlock investment in energy efficiency technologies across the United States. The platform will connect building owners, program managers, and financial institutions to data management and modeling tools and will increase efficacy and reduce costs of EE programs by supporting an accessible, and competitive, EE marketplace of building technologies, financing, and software solutions. Maalka will develop a series of open application programming and user interfaces for connecting users to a next generation energy modeling and simulation engine. The interfaces will serve as the core of our open platform to facilitate automated portfolio-level energy modeling and insight generation. Upon this platform, we will develop interfaces for managing data collection, analysis, and integration with external customer management systems."

        "abstract": "One lesson learned from ITER and applicable to future fusion systems like DEMO is the need for superconductors that are more economical and stable to replace present ITER superconductors Nb3Sn and NbTi because of rising cost of liquid helium and Nb. In the near term, very formidable technological and manufacturing issues likely mean that YBCO, BSCCO, or Fe-based superconductors would not be sufficiently cost effective or available in long enough piece-length, or otherwise be counted on to fill the need. Current 2nd generation Magnesium Diboride (MgB2) superconductor already has the stability and performance level meeting, and potentially exceeding the requirements of fusion magnets that operate in medium fields and temperatures. With expected further advances in materials, and technological and engineering aspects, combined with commercial-scale manufacturing capability enabled by Hyper Tech\u2019s continuous tube forming and filling process, MgB2is arguably the only superconductor that could offer the performance of Nb3Sn at NbTi pricing in medium term, and therefore is a viable and logical candidate for incorporation into future fusion systems. We are proposing approaches aimed at realizing the potential of next generation MgB2 wires for fusion magnet applications: 1) Using low activation 11B-enriched precursor material in fabrication of MgB2 wires to enhance resistance against neutron irradiation. 2) Improving high-field engineering critical current density in MgB2 wires to a 8,000 A\/mm2 benchmark at 5T-15K by adding a catalyst to promote MgB2 formation to maximize the area fraction of the reacted MgB2 layer, and using boron powder doped with Dy2O3 to enhance flux pinning. 3) Using modified strand architecture and wire processing technology to fabricate 2nd generation MgB2 multifilament wires of high copper content, and of reduced effective filament diameter for improved thermal and magnetic stability. 4) Incorporating the advanced strands developed into a prototype cable patterned after a proposed design in a future fusion system."

        "abstract": "Significant capital and operational cost reductions are required for algal energy to become widespread. The cost of harvesting algae from 0.1\u20130.5 wt.% in cultures to 20-30 wt. % concentrates is a critical driver for initial capital, energy and resource costs of algal fuel and products. Energy-efficient and scalable harvesting technologies must be developed for the algal industry to thrive. Cross-flow filtration and vacuum filtering using unique ThinSieveTM membranes recently developed at Molecule Works Inc. are proposed to harvest algae in two process steps. The cross-flow filtration concentrates an algal culture into thick slurry of 2- 5 wt.% solid. Then, the concentrate is dewatered on a vacuum filter into wet cakes of 20-30 wt. % solids. The membranes are the critical component that determines cost and efficiency of the membrane processes. Molecule Works\u2019s ThinSieveTM membranes comprise a 50 micro-meter -thin porous metal sheet with ceramic coatings. The uniform and small-size pores on the membrane surface exclude algal cells and allow 100% algal harvesting. Since no strange chemicals or materials are used in the membrane process, almost all (&gt;99%) the water and soluble in original cultures can be recycled. Thinness of the ThinSieveTM membrane provides exceptionally high flux compared to the other membrane materials of similar pore sizes and enables fabrication of membrane modules with high packing density (&gt;1000 m2\/m3). The ceramic\/metallic material is biocidal and resistant to bio-fouling and bonding by biological cells, which are rich in algal cultures. The ThinSieveTM membrane can be cleaned and reused for long-term operation. The high flux, high membrane packing density, and reusability of the ThinSieveTM membrane makes it possible to reduce energy consumption and capital cost by 30% relative to DOE\u2019s base case. In Phase I, the ThinSieveTM membrane structures will be optimized to achieve the proposed performance targets for the concentration and de-watering of a few different algal species. Effective membrane cleaning methods will be developed to obtain stable filtering performances through periodic cleaning\/regeneration. A cross-flow module prototype of 1-m2 membrane area will be assembled to demonstrate the feasibility of building high throughput membrane modules. The process design and economic analysis will be conducted to show the pathways of achieving &gt;30% cost reduction goal."

        "abstract": "The neutral density in magnetically confined fusion experiments is an important parameter, affecting plasma stability and confinement and providing fuel for the plasma. Despite this importance, few diagnostics exist to directly measure the neutral density. One diagnostic is two-photon absorption laser induced fluorescence (TALIF). Current TALIF systems rely on large, dye laser based systems to produce deep UV (DUV) laser light. Such lasers pose a number of issues that prevents their use on fusion experiments. We propose to design and construction of a compact, solid-state UV laser to replace dye lasers in TALIF system. The laser light will be produced through harmonic frequency generation of the fundamental of a solid-state pumped Yb:YAG laser. In Phase I we will demonstrate that by using a series of non-linear crystals we can produce 206 nm light, the fifth harmonic frequency of the Yb:YAG laser. We will demonstrate that the fundamental of the Yb:YAG laser can be tuned to 1025 nm while maintaining high output energy. We will produce a conceptual design a high energy version of the system for Phase II, capable of producing a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio in a working magnetically confined fusion experiment. In Phase II we will build the laser system to be installed on a magnetic fusion experiment to measure the neutral density in the edge region. Such as diagnostic can be applied to any plasma device where the neutral density is an important parameter, aiding in control of plasma experiments from fusion devices to plasma processing devices. A compact UV laser would also be useful for other diagnostic systems, specifically Raman scattering, where such a laser would increase signal levels while operating far from bright background sources."

        "abstract": "Existing methods of producing micron powders for additive manufacturing (3D printing) make use of continuous flow of gas or plasma jets to atomize a metallic melt stream. These methods suffer from producing powders with a broad distribution of powder sizes resulting in low yields for small sizes and thus high cost, because of their fundamental limitations on the velocity shear and ram pressure of the CW plasma or gas jets. The high cost of the specialty powders such as Ti limits the market potential and growth of AM. We propose to replace the continuous process with a repetitively pulsed process by using our proprietary pulsed contoured-gap coaxial plasma gun to produce pulsed plasma jets. The plasma jets will have 10 times higher ram pressure and velocity shear, the key parameters in determining the particle size and the width of the size distribution in atomizing a melt stream. As a result, our proposed technique will produce smaller particles, with better sphericity, and narrower distribution of sizes peaked where we want it to be, by precision tuning the density and velocity of our pulsed plasma jets. Increasing yields reduces production costs and increases value of powders produced. Our proposed technique will also likely enable production of specialty powders not producible by other physical methods. AM is a game-changer in the 21st century, transforming the way we manufacture, given its potential for huge time savings, waste reduction and energy savings. AM can also be used to make highly complex parts which are extremely difficult or impossible to make using traditional manufacturing methods. Due to its unique properties, titanium (Ti) is a leading metal powder for AM. The market for Ti powder for AM application alone in 2017 was $155M and is growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 25%, and expected to reach a market size of about $740M by 2024. The proposed research will also contribute to advancing the frontiers of plasma-surface (PSI) and plasma-material interactions (PMI), the nonlinear interactions of a high-momentum-density plasma flow with a liquid medium, the development of a high repetition-rate, self-switching plasma gun, and the investigation of electrode erosion rates."

        "abstract": "High field magnets (&gt;16 T) are required for next generation accelerators and upgrading existing facilities. Fields greater than 20T can only be achieved using the High temperature superconductors [Bi2Sr2CaCu2Ox (Bi-2212) and YBa2Cu3Ox] due to their high upper critical field Hc2. Multifilamentary round Bi-2212\/Ag wires have demonstrated many attractive features, such as high irreversibility field (Birr &gt; 100T), isotropic electromagnetic performance, solenoid layer winding, highest engineering critical current density, JE, at fields higher than 20T and compatibility with conventional cabling and strand insulation methods. These advantages make it easy to adapt the well established Nb3Sn technology to make Bi-2212 one of the most promising materials to enable superconducting magnets in the &gt; 20 T range. Even though encouraging reports exist on the suitability of Bi-2212\/Ag multifilamentary wires, the R&amp;D efforts for high field magnets are focused on low temperature superconductors mostly due to availability in long continuous lengths with uniform properties. Improving the properties and the piece-length of the Bi-2212 superconductors is of highest importance for the greater use of these materials as possible conductors in magnets for high energy particle colliders. A reliable source of powder with definable properties is needed for the stabilization of the wire manufacturing process, particularly to avoid the JE limiting defects. Performance of a wire depends upon the interplay between powder characteristics, wire drawing process variables and configuration, and thermal processing of the wire. The proposed Small Business Research Program will address key challenges for demonstration scale (&gt;1km lengths) wire for magnets with fields between 25 T to 50T, as well as for production scale (&gt; 3 km) in fields between 16 to 25 T. The SBIR also focuses on improving the JE, of round multifilamentary wires, reduce flaws in long length conductors and reduce cost by improving yield. In this program, powder production will be further optimized to facilitate wire manufacturability on large billet fabrication and enhance wire uniformity. The composition of the powder will be addressed by adding fine secondary phases ("

        "abstract": "The Department of Energy is seeking the development of a cost-effective, versatile alternative to water for dust suppression at hazardous sites during remediation activities such as demolition, construction, soil\/sediment excavation and trucking. While water is abundant and cheap, frequent applications are required. Water is also ineffective to lock-down the loose surface contamination in place. Consequently, wind and rain transport hazardous contaminants into the air or groundwater, far from the source. These pose regulatory and health concerns to site personnel and the general public, as well as the cost burden of cleanup to the tax payer. During the proposed project, the company will develop DustSafe as a very effective fixative for airborne and loosely held contaminants on any surface. The embedded additives would increase the efficiency of trapping the contaminant into the coating and help visualizing their presence through distinct color formation. DustSafe can be customized for specific hazards, targeting use in other nuclear or hazardous remediation sites by simple modifications to the additives. The coated surface will be durable to wind and rain erosion, and mechanical fracture, to ensure dust or contaminants fixed to the surface are not released or airborne. In Phase I, the company will screen DustSafe formulations with additives targeted to improve capture and visual indication of toxic contaminants like chromium and uranium. Benchmarking will be done with water and one commercial dust suppressing fixative. Tests will be designed to evaluate the spray\/mist characteristics, wetting, cure time and adhesion. Dust suppression efficacy will be evaluated by generating aerosols with simulated dust followed by spray application of the suppressants. Color formation will be tested using soil contaminated with soluble salts of chromium or uranium and analyzed for binding efficiency. Coated powder samples will be tested for durability against wind, rain and mechanical impact to demonstrate DustSafe feasibility for further development and rigorous field testing in Phase II."

        "abstract": "Adoption of ceramic matrix composites (CMCs) could enable significant improvements in gas turbine efficiency due to their inherently higher temperature capabilities with respect to metals. However, their utility is limited due to a vaporization or the protective oxide scale in water vapor containing combustion environments. Advanced environmental barrier coating (EBC) capable of 3100\u00b0F operation are needed protect the CMCs and enable utilization of their beneficial properties. The proposed work provides the first all-oxide EBC system which is capable of operating beyond the ~2500\u00b0F stability limit of current state-of-the-art Si bond coat EBC systems. Modified bond coat compositions will be utilized to replace Si bond coats while an outer TBC layer will be deposited to provide thermal cyclic and erosion durability while also enhancing CMAS resistance. This T-EBC system will thus enable significant increases in the operating temperature capabilities of CMCs. In Phase I, the project will deposit the oxide bond coat via the dipcasting method and subsequently deposit the remaining T-EBC via a novel plasma spray \u2013 physical vapor deposition (PS-PVD) technique. These coatings will be evaluated via thermal cycling in a flowing steam environment at temperatures of 2600\u00b0F with high temperature oxidation testing at 2900\u00b0F. In addition, the erosion resistance will be evaluated at room temperature. Three different coating architectures will be evaluated to assess the thermomechanical performance and durability. Successful demonstration of the all-oxide coatings would have significant commercial potential for both defense and commercial aviation applications as well as stationary power generation. CMCs could be utilized throughout these applications and would provide more efficient operation in terms of both cost and fuel usage. Though would ultimately result in lower emissions due to lower fuel usage as well as elevated temperature operation which natively produces fewer emissions."

        "abstract": "Utility-scale solar is deeply integrated with the national electric grid and is considered critical infrastructure. It is well recognized that the monitoring and control networks of large solar plants provide attractive targets for cyber-attacks. Energy production data are financial records that must have business integrity; utility control signals and site alarms must be authenticated to protect equipment and personnel. We propose to significantly improve utility solar cybersecurity through a unique combination of two complementary next generation technologies: Named Data Networking and Blockchain. Under the SunShot program, we have developed a wireless solar gateway that incorporates cutting edge Named Data Networking, developed by a UCLA-led consortium for the last eight years. This novel networking protocol provides strong cybersecurity where each node has a unique digital security certificate and all transmitted data are secured by crypto signature. We propose the addition of a synergistic next generation \u2018distributed consensus protocol\u2019 (the well- known Blockchain is one example of this) which will be a public immutable transaction ledger that cannot be modified, destroyed, or repudiated. The ledger assures that energy production values are maintained exactly as when entered; financial partners can trust data without expensive third-party validation. Utility controls and equipment alerts are securely recorded and can be reviewed if concerns arise. While Blockchain has been used previously to protect solar data, our proposed solution brings unique advantages: (1) Our proposed solution enables the ledger to be implemented precisely at the point of data generation. Existing solutions require critical data to be transported from the field to a cloud-based ledger, exposing transactions in insecure legacy last mile communication links; (2) The existing network certificates will be used to substitute Proof of Authentication for the Blockchain Proof of Work. \u2018Security by Anonymity\u2019 is not appropriate for industrial and governmental uses, but the other security attributes of distributed ledgers are valuable; (3) Based on the existing network security properties, the new tamper-proof ledger goes further; detecting compromised devices through application-aware intrusion detection; and (4) Our ledger will incorporate a mesh \u2018Tangle\u2019 similar to that used in the Iota protocol, instead of the legacy linear Blockchain. Scalability is improved because all nodes participate in transaction validation, rather than depending on high power servers."

Leveraging its development program through SBIR phases I, II and III, ION will validate the technology at &gt;10 MWe scale within 4 years (2022), which planning is based on ION\u2019s vast experience of its recent solvent development efforts. The proposed Phase I project will take 9 months and the activities include solvent syntheses up to 1 gallon each, a suite of characterizations that determine physico-chemical properties and initial thermal and oxidative properties. These results will be assessed against solvent properties of DOE BBS Case 12 to estimate the impact on a capture plant for a 550 MWe power plant using flue gas of a coal-fueled power plant. There are several aspects of the new solvent that will contribute to reducing the cost of capture toward the DOE goal of $30 per tonne CO2 (tCO2); e.g., the solvent has a low water content (10-30 wt%), enhanced carrying capacity, lower regeneration energy through increased stripper pressure ("

        "abstract": "Solar Photovoltaics is the fastest growing source of electric power. While overall solar array costs have fallen dramatically year after year helping drive solar growth to date, &quot;Installation Costs&quot; have grown as a percentage of total costs, with solar soft costs now over 40% in even the utility-scale market. Further, the Net Zero Energy Buildings market is unable to utilize the most cost-effective 1-axis tracking solar systems, and there are inherent weight and size limitations on solar panels and racking due to the current installation methods. An automated solar array assembly system capable of installing at least 1 mega-watt of array in a single day directly from component parts in shipping containers will be built. This integrated solar automated installation system will significantly accelerate solar deployment at lower costs due to far higher worker productivity, and will exceed the Department of Energy SunShot 2030 goals. In Phase I core elements of this automated system will be constructed and demonstrated. Included are automated systems for solar panel placement, new solar structural support systems for automated assembly, and new ways of delivering completed array sections to installed posts. Phase I will end the year with the automated assembly system being used for an actual customer solar installation. In Phase II, all automation aspects of the project will be completed to fully assemble solar arrays directly from shipping containers.The output rate will also be increased from 1 mega-watt\/day to 2 mega-watts\/day per system. Tracking solar collectors yield the highest power output per solar panel, but tracking to date always requires using extra land to avoid row-to-row shading. New ways to wire the panels themselves and the rows\/columns of a solar array have been devised to eliminate the power degradation from row-to-row shading to significantly increase overall array output. This solar tracking breakthrough will be tested in Phase I and advanced to market in Phase II and III."

        "abstract": "Silicon-based sensors are used in most particle physics experiments. However, particle detectors that operate at high energies \u2013 roughly 30KeV to 3MeV \u2013 have requirements that cannot currently be met with silicon detectors. Instead, these detectors use large, cumbersome scintillators. To replace the scintillators with silicon detectors, the silicon mass would need a thickness \u22655mm. This thickness could be achieved by direct silicon bonding of the finished device wafer to a thick silicon sub-wafer. However, state-of-the-art direct wafer hydrophobic bonding technology needs a temperature higher than 600\u02daC to create reliable Si-Si chemical bonds; these extreme temperatures would damage the detector circuitry. To overcome this limitation, NHanced proposes to fabricate the detector directly on a thick silicon wafer. This can be achieved only by a flexible fabrication facility, as it requires non-standard tool tuning and equipment to accommodate the non-standard thickness. However, it is by far the most reliable way to build the detector, since the silicon substrate will be almost by definition a single crystal. Our fabrication facility has more than 20 years\u2019 experience in fabricating and fast-delivering prototypes for a large variety of customers and applications. NHanced has demonstrated 3D integration of InP, GaAs, GaN, CMOS, and other materials. The fab has already processed wafers with a thickness twice that of standard wafers. In addition, NHanced has a longstanding partnership with Fermilab, for whom we are currently fabricating silicon sensors with high resistance substrates for use in high energy particle detector programs. All of these factors make NHanced a natural choice for this project. In Phase I, NHanced Semiconductors, Inc. will adapt the production lines at its wholly-owned foundry in North Carolina, and will demonstrate through simple test vehicles its ability to build circuitry on thick, non-standard silicon wafers. NHanced will test and analyze the wafers, create plans for process improvements, and build a commercialization support plan for low to moderate volume production. In addition, NHanced will work very closely with Fermilab to define a plan for designing a detector in preparation for the Phase II effort."

        "abstract": "Optical Engines Inc will develop a hybrid Master Oscillator Power Amplifier (MOPA), system counter pumped PCF amplifier for the highest pulse energy available from a fiber laser system. This all fiber front end will be coupled to a small bulk amplifier with the ultimate goal of increasing the energy of the fiber portion of the system such that the bulk portion will not be necessary. This arbitrary pulse generation, all fiber amplifier will be highly reliable through the complete removal of all free space optics resulting in a device that is significantly more robust and reliable. For nearly 4 years, Optical Engines has worked in close collaboration with Fermi National Laboratory providing fiber expertise and PCF power amplifiers for their particle beam notching development work. This arbitrary pulse pattern laser amplifier system will utilize Optical Engines Patented Etched Air Taper fiber pump combiner technology. This technology has been utilized in directed energy systems with pump efficiencies of over 99% and signal efficiencies of over 96% have been demonstrated in commercially available co pumped devices; reliably operating at over 2.5kW of pump power for over 5 years. Optical Engines will utilize a double pass amplifier modulation stage with phase modulation in order to create both the arbitrary pulse patterns as well at the necessary spectral spreading to increase non-linear thresholds. This pulse forming seed stage will be followed by 2 mid stage amplifiers based on advanced LMA amplifier designs to boost the signal to necessary for power amplification. Key to this program would be to increase the pulse energies achievable in fiber amplifiers to minimize the requirements for any following bulk stage. Bulk amplifier stages are system limiters for achieving high average power so it is important to have a fiber power amplifier that can supply the highest energies possible. In order to achieve this superior performance, counter pumped architectures, composite amplifier designs and UV co pumping will also be investigated. In order to test these amplifiers, Optical Engines will continue its close collaboration with FNL to develop the appropriate testing structures to create realistic test scenarios. Optical Engines has developed pulsed amplifiers to over 300W and CW narrow line width systems to 2kW going to over 5kW of near diffraction limited power output. For this program Optical Engines will also work to develop architectures that can be extended to multi-kW operation within the next 2-5 years."

        "abstract": "Radioxenon collection and monitoring provide valuable information about nuclear weapon testing and nuclear power accidents via 80 radionuclide detection stations around the world. Radioactive xenon is produced via nuclear reactions in nuclear reactors or nuclear weapons. However, the ratios of xenon isotopes vary based on the production mechanism, so by accurately quantifying these ratios, the source of the radioxenon can be ascertained. Current detection systems use sodium iodide (NaI) scintillators to detect photons in coincidence with a plastic scintillator to detect beta particles in order to reduce background. However, NaI detectors have relatively poor energy resolution which increases the likelihood of recording a false positive. Furthermore, the photomultiplier tubes used to read out NaI detectors are known to drift as a function of temperature, reducing the accuracy of the energy measurements, especially when the detectors are deployed in challenging environments. Semiconductor detectors inherently offer better energy resolution. CdZnTe, an alternative room- temperature semiconductor detector, has the same effective atomic number as NaI, and therefore the same efficiency per unit volume. The gamma-ray energy resolution of CdZnTe is seven times better than NaI at 662 keV which will reduce the minimum detectable concentration of radioxenon in a sample, improving international authorities\u2019 ability to sense nuclear weapon detonations. In the first phase of this effort we will develop a drop-in direct replacement of NaI gamma-ray detectors with CdZnTe in existing radioxenon sensors. This will improve the sensitivity of the instruments to radioxenon, increasing authorities\u2019 ability to detect smaller nuclear weapons tests. We will also examine alternate detector geometries for further improvements."

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop the design of a system concentration of brines and wastewater using low enthalpy geothermal heat. The system combines a forward osmosis (FO) membrane with a thermally switchable draw. Forward osmosis technology excels in processing difficult-to-treat waters, such as brines and oil and gas wastewater. Porifera\u2019s FO membrane has higher flux and reduced reverse salt flux compared to conventional membranes. It is more chemically stable, enabling the development of a system that uses a draw solute which can recovered using low-grade heat from geothermal sources. The draw solute can obtain high osmotic pressure and is recyclable for reuse within the system. Compared to other state of the art technologies, the system will have higher water recovery and treat more problematic water using low-enthalpy geothermal heat to drive the system. Concentration of brines and wastewater is an energy intensive process and does not utilize available geothermal heat. This proposal will enable the design of a pilot system that will concentrate brines and wastewater using low enthalpy geothermal heat. The system will have higher water recovery and treat more problematic water using less energy compared to state of the art technologies. For this SBIR Phase I project we will first identify a target pilot site for demonstration of the technology and then design and specify the components of the pilot system. We will target customers in the oil and gas industry, geothermal brines for mineral recovery, or power plant wastewater treatment."

The objective of the Phase I SBIR research is to assess the feasibility of developing applications for building energy models to be used by the reinsurance industry. Prisere LLC, with the support of the architecture faculty of the Rhode Island School of Design, will assess the computational tools of building energy and reinsurance underwriting models. The research team will perform basic data analysis with multiple hazard simulation for weather-related hazards in each of the 8 U.S. climatic zones (with three sub-zones in each) for 24 simulation sets to determine the feasibility of developing applications and services for building energy models to inform reinsurance underwriting and capital investment in energy efficiency. Finally, Prisere LLC will conduct cost-benefit analysis and return on investment analysis for property hazard scenarios in each of the 24 U.S. climactic sub-zones."

        "abstract": "To this day, the broad field of large-area photon detection has relied on a very expensive 80-year-old technology. Our novel Photosensor Technology has the capability of supplanting that old technology with a modern, cost-effective, and uniquely robust alternative, which provides sensitivity to visible and ultravolet light, exceptionally low intrinsic radioactivity, low noise, and provides high detection performance. Therefore, it can open new horizons in all application areas, including large experiments in fundamental science, and new types of scanners for both functional medical imaging and nuclear security. This technology can also address a wide spectrum of important societal needs, particularly by opening new markets, previously considered virtually unachievable due to the shortcomings and\/or high cost of the current technologies. For instance, thin and lightweight detector panels can serve as modules for ultrasensitive whole-body-enclosing medical scanners that could provide ultra-low-dose cancer screening for a wider, even symptom-free population. The same invention enables custom-shaped detectors of illicit radioactive materials. In general, this project can lead to the creation of a highly profitable and multi-faceted hi-tech industry.Our research will focus on high purity of the materials used to make our photosensors, as well as all of the supporting structures. All components will be constructed, for the first time ever, out of ultrapure fused quartz. Quartz is not only one of the purest materials available, it also transmits ultraviolet light. That is particularly important for virtually all future experiments in this field, because most of the light that is emitted in these processes is concentrated precisely in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum. Our technology allows us to use fused quartz without any additional costs in the assembly process, which presents a great advantage over prior art. Our immediate potential customers include research groups and funding agencies involved in the construction of very large next-generation detectors. Potential customers are also in the areas of preventive medical diagnostics and nuclear security."

        "abstract": "Development of the Devonian and other shale formations nationwide, by drilling horizontal wells and completing them with water is a commercial success. However, water as the fracturing fluid is undesirable in stimulating gas production from all of the natural fractures penetrated, resulting in poor recovery efficiency and a growing problem associated with high volumes of water demanded and the disposal of briny returned water. This warrants a concentrated R&amp;D effort in partnership with the Federal government in addressing and solving this technical challenge. The offeror intends to develop a technology and tools to enable fracking the shale formation with liquefied natural gas (LNG) in open hole completions, therefore eliminating the use of water in the horizontal sections of the well. The design tools will include methods to assess the in-situ stress along the length of the horizontal well, determining what intervals to stimulate and determining the fluid injection pressure and rate required to inflate the natural fractures needed to stimulate production. Phase I work consists of three major efforts: model development, bench scale testing, and industry assessment. Existing models will be updated to represent a Devonian Shale in-situ stress field and the change in that stress field caused by the injection of a fluid under high pressure. Laboratory work is proposed, using shale samples, to obtain data needed to represent the Devonian Shale. A state-of-the-art industry assessment will be prepared on tools and methods currently available to measure and record downhole conditions in a horizontal well. The results will be used to design a new well completion technique to be demonstrated in the follow-on phase of the project."

        "abstract": "Past DOE SBIR programs have shown that accident-tolerant cladding like silicon carbide (SiC) fuel rod cladding can be a durable, less reactive alternative for zirconium alloy cladding for light water reactors. The higher temperature performance and increased safety potential of accident tolerant fuel rod cladding during a loss of coolant accident (LOCA) is expected to both improve the sustainability of the existing fleet of commercial light water reactors and serve as a key building block for future generation reactors.Grid-to-rod fretting is one of the leading causes of fuel rod failure in modern pressurized water reactor (PWR) fuel assemblies. SiC cladding, being significantly harder than the zirconium alloys currently used for PWR &amp; BWR fuel rod cladding, should be less prone to fuel rod failure due to fretting if used in conjunction with metallic spacer grids. In fact, it is so hard that the opposite problem now becomes a significant concern; that the vibrating fuel rod will wear away the spring contacts and stops on the zirconium alloy intermediate spacer grids and PWR flow mixing grids, thereby compromising the fundamental positioning function of those grids. Also, attaching zirconium alloy spacer grids to the guide tubes in a PWR can be a challenge if those guide tubes are likewise converted to SiC.Although ongoing efforts have rightly placed priority on proving the accident-tolerant fuel rod cladding viable, concerns over the potential fretting and structural integrity issues associated with the accident- tolerant fuel assembly need to be addressed and resolved in parallel to ensure that implementation is not delayed. An all-SiC structure also simplifies the assembly process for PWR fuel assemblies.The purpose of this project is to develop the manufacturing processes required for a SiC grid assembly. 3D CAD models of a grid assembly concept will be developed. Existing processes for fabrication of SiC fuel rod cladding will be modified as needed to fabricate tubes and flat pieces for grid assemblies. A grid assembly fixture will be developed and one or more grid assemblies will be fabricated. The assemblies will then be characterized and tested. Based on the Phase I results, the processes will be refined and additional analyses and tests will be performed that include full-scale flow tests and irradiation tests."

        "abstract": "California needs to advance the grid of the future to achieve the State\u2019s climate change goals that requires significantly more renewables and electric vehicles. Currently, the biggest obstacles to achieving California\u2019s ambitious climate goals are solar photovoltaic overgeneration and grid congestion caused by current electric vehicle fast charging technology. The Project overcomes both obstacles by deploying a modular smart-grid solution that integrates local solar photovoltaics with intelligent storage while simultaneously providing energy management, low-impact fast charging and grid services. The penetration and value of solar is maximized by leveraging large storage and load control to integrate onsite solar and transact with excess solar on the same distribution circuit. The software is designed to optimally route solar energy to the site host, a large battery system; to charge electric vehicles at super- fast speeds and to supply grid power services while improving grid reliability, raising utilization and allowing others to realize greater value from their clean energy investments. To date, engineering design, simulation, component selection and system integration into the modular microgrid are largely complete. The Phase I Project goal is to develop control, communications and transaction software necessary to integrate onsite and local solar resources. The software shall also provide analytics and optimization to direct and control power flow from a solar portfolio and battery storage to serve the highest value load, in the most efficient, cost-effective manner. Following the completion of the software objective of Phase I, a prototype modular, microgrid will be installed at the site and operated that harvests site solar; transacts &amp; wheels a portfolio of local PV sources to store and supply power for super-fast electric vehicle charging system, the site and grid. A key objective is to demonstrate the project\u2019s scalability, a blueprint for optimizing distributed solar by efficiently storing and routing power to highest value loads including electrifying transportation. The Project\u2019s success will promote public and private sector use of solar to power super-fast charging stations in a cost-effective way."

        "abstract": "Proliferation detection equipment requires deployment at remote, inaccessible sites and has to be able to operate over a rather wide temperature range. Scintillation light due to neutrons, gamma rays, or other indicators of nuclear material is typically detected with photon sensors based on photocathodes and microchannel-plate (MCP) amplifiers. Incom\u2019s MCP technology uses an Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) process to impart resistive and emissive properties to Glass Capillary Array (GCA) substrates. This offers the unique opportunity of tuning the thermo-electrical properties of the resistive layer, which is not possible with conventional MCPs. We propose to develop MCPs with optimized resistive coatings that can operate at ultra-high count rates in high background environments, and across broad temperature ranges. This development will afford photodetectors that operate stably over a broad temperature range, and to enable \u201clow- power\u201d LAPPDs by using the low-TCR MCPs in low gain mode. In Phase I our work will be twofold; we will a) investigate alternative tunable resistance materials that exhibit improved TCR characteristics, b) evaluate the temperature range of operation and related performance limits of our current baseline MCP technology. From this we will develop a thermal budget model used to guide further (Phase-II) material research, coating optimization, and implementation of candidate materials into fully functional low-TCR MCPs. Other potential applications that would benefit from stable, high-dynamic range ALD-GCA-MCPs include a wide variety of sensors for space flight instrumentation, time-of-flight mass spectrometers, PET scanners, Proton radiography, as well as high-temperature (T \u2265 200\u00b0 C) PMTs for mining and oil prospecting applications"

        "abstract": "Cost and time associated with material waste, quality control, inspection, and manufacturing of nuclear fuel assembly components can be detrimental to nuclear plant design and development. Specifically, BWR lower tie plates are prime component examples that inherently carry these issues due to their complex geometries and attachment points. The design engineer must always weigh the manufacturing practices against the operational benefits. To combat this issue, the Department of Energy is highly interested in advancing methods of manufacturing for nuclear energy technologies that allow for easier engineering and commercial production of nuclear fuel assembly component. Proving that complex geometries, lower tie plates, can be manufactured with the same design material using additive material technologies shows the nuclear industry that former manufacturing complications are no longer necessary. Additive material technologies also give the designer the option of adding beneficial features to tie plates during the Computer Aided Design (CAD) process that were previously impossible (due to tooling impediments). During Phase I, multiple lower tie plate designs that incorporate a debris filter and the nozzle section into a single part will be modeled using CAD. Once modeled, the tie plates will be analyzed using Finite Element Analysis (FEA) in parallel with public-domain tie plates to compare structural integrity. Lastly, after structural and fatigue have been optimized, the composite tie plate designs will be manufactured using 3D printing, and then tested to record desired properties.Using additive material technologies (i.e. metallic 3D printing) minimizes material waste and inspection time while producing fine-tolerance products \u2013 increasing quality \u2013 that frees the designers to focus on component operation, not manufacturing (welding, milling, stamping, etc). Proof-of-concept in Phase I will show a 3D printed tie plate can be placed on a lead test assembly in Phase II, and full production after irradiation testing fuel assemblies with 3D printed tie plates in Phase III."

        "abstract": "Domestic coal can be used to manufacture high value carbon products for multiple applications. The market value of these high performance materials often exceeds the fuel and heat value of coal, which illustrates there are sustainable market forces for manufacturing carbon materials from coal. However, current processes to produce high performance carbon materials from coal pose significant challenges associated with the substantial chemical modifications of the native coal structures that require high temperatures and\/or strongly oxidative, highly corrosive reagents. This small business proposes an innovative approach for producing high value, carbon-based products from coal feedstocks for the manufacturing of high conductivity materials for electrochemical applications. The proposed technology builds upon the pre-existing coal structures to create high conductivity features under mild conditions. The innovation is a two-step process that generates carbonaceous materials with key structural attributes for high conductivity. The process provides minimal reagent usage, efficient recycling (&gt;90%) and produces a carbon product for electrochemical applications with 20-30X higher value than the coal price. In addition, the process generates valuable byproducts such as minerals and low emission gaseous fuels. The small business performed several pre-proposal experiments that have demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed process. The overall goal of the Phase I program is to demonstrate the feasibility and economic viability of the proposed approach. During the Phase I effort, this small business will: (a) screen and select coal sources suitable as feedstocks; (b) demonstrate scalable processes to produce the high conductivity material; (c) demonstrate performance in battery electrode formulations, one potential electrochemical application, and (d) perform techno-economic analysis to outline pathways for scale up and further development and optimization in Phase II."

        "abstract": "The current state of the art in pressure sensing for dynamic flow measurement is limited and in many cases not available when it comes to harsh, high temperature environments. Accurate pressure measurements of highly transient flows, e.g. combustor instabilities and other dynamic events, requires the sensing element to have the shortest fluidic path connection with the environment and therefore be located in the wall in direct contact with the hot fluid. Active cooling is used to address the high temperature to an extent, with a certain class of sensors capable of operating at temperature of up to 2000 F in this fashion. Beyond this temperature threshold, no practical solution exists for monitoring and\/or measuring fluid flow pressure oscillations without a compromise on frequency response. With an increasing number of applications in the power, energy generation and advanced propulsion market segments pushing the temperature envelope by leveraging advanced manufacturing and high temperature materials, a growing need exists that can only be addressed by an ultra-high temperature capable pressure sensor with high frequency response. The proposed effort will leverage low temperature plasma as a transduction method towards the measurement of pressure dynamics in high temperature applications. The sensor solution being proposed will feature ultra-high temperature capability without compromise in frequency response (&gt; MHz) in a small package that can be implemented in various application, from tracking instabilities in combustion systems for power generation to health monitoring of military\/commercial advanced propulsion systems. The proposed sensor system will enable high frequency pressure measurement in ultra-high temperature environments (&gt;2500F) currently not possible by commercially available sensors. Commercial applications span from tracking instabilities in combustions systems for power generation to health monitoring of next generation propulsion systems."

        "abstract": "The 2017 changes to \u00a7690.12 of the National Electrical Code (NEC) require that all photovoltaic (PV) systems installed in or on buildings to include a \u2018rapid shutdown\u2019 mechanism which reduces the voltage within 1 inch of an installed module to less than 80V within 30 seconds of rapid shutdown initiation. Currently this requirement is challenging to achieve in a cost-effective manner. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) has invented a prototype device which quickly and reliably de-energizes PV modules in compliance with \u00a7690. As part of this Technology Transfer Opportunity, we shall build on the work done by NREL to achieve a solution and product family that meets or exceeds the NEC 2017 \u00a7690.12 requirements. As part of the Phase I SBIR, InnoSys proposes to collaborate and partner with NREL and Christopher Alan, the inventor of the de-energizer technology and developer of the breadboard single de-energizer module prototype. In Phase I, InnoSys shall perform best practice to redesign and scale this benchtop prototype to larger system voltages (i.e., from less than 100 Volts up to 1000 Volts) and higher currents (i.e., up to 10 amps per PV module) and provide higher levels of detection, protection, operation, fault tolerance, communications for the modules\/systems\/networks. We shall construct a Phase I Proof-of-Concept and also perform comprehensive testing of the Phase I Proof- of-Concept 1000 Volt modules and laboratory scale system. We shall finalize the specifications and requirements for Phase II and provide a Phase I Final Report and a Phase II roadmap to subsequently commercialize and deliver products in Phase II that simplify compliance with the 2017 NEC."

        "abstract": "Advanced gas cooled reactor designs utilizing Tristructural Isotropic (TRISO) fuels continue to be strong avenues for research and testing. However, concerns continue about fabrication defects that can lead to failures during operation. Internal defects in the multi-layer coating of the kernel can lead to fuel failure at the particle or pebble level. Layer integrity is the key to the reliability and usability of all TRISO-based fuel forms. During operation the integrated effects of fuel fissioning, radiation-induced material transformations, and internal pressurize buildup combine to grow and propagate pre-existing internal defects. The consequential failures may lead to the uncontrolled dissemination of fission products through the system. In addition to leading to costly cleanup and repairs of systems, such failures may jeopardize public health and erode public confidence in these technologies. These concerns will continue to exist without a cost effective and systematic means of inspecting every fuel particle to eliminate these failure modes.This proposal advocates for the development and demonstration of two non-destructive testing (NDT) methods for the evaluation and inspection of TRISO fuel particles to detect defects that typically occur in less than 1% of particles. The methodologies and equipment will be developed with the purpose of creating a novel inspection system or systems that can be utilized to further the development and introduction of advanced reactor designs. A successful design will have the capability to detect defects within TRISO fuel particles at a rate suitable for production volumes either individually or in concert and with a high degree of certainty for defect detection. This system or systems must have a capability for automated inspection and disposition of particles on an individual particle basis.The two inspection technologies that NovaTech proposes to evaluate are resonant frequency analysis and thermography. Both of these technologies are non-destructive inspection techniques that are capable of identifying subsurface defects such as cracks, delaminations and voids. However, each technique uses fundamentally different principals to arrive at results. NovaTech believes that in concert these two techniques can provide a robust, efficient and cost effective solution to inspecting TRISO fuel pellets."

        "abstract": "After decades of research into carbon capture methods, we still do not have a favorable option.Current carbon capture technology using aqueous amine scrubbing has found a degree of usage in specific applications, but the drawbacks such as high cost, low capacity, degradation during cycling applications, and its corrosive nature have prevented widespread adoption. One potential solution is the development of high-capacity solid sorbents capable of overcoming the drawbacks faced by typical amine scrubbing. The sorbents proposed for study in this project are amine-functionalized metal organic frameworks with specific metal centers selected based on cost and performance. The source of amine used for functionalization was chosen due to its affordable nature and the fact that it is derived from a material that is otherwise considered waste. In 2016, 30.4% of utility electricity generation came from coal-fired power plants, which was produced through combustion of over 677 million tons of coal. The concomitant level of CO2 release necessitates transformational carbon capture technologies capable of capturing CO2 efficiently and at lower cost. In Phase I of this project, the first goal is to demonstrate successful synthesis of the modified metal organic framework sorbent. This will be followed by testing to show that the activated sorbent is sufficiently stable under humidity representative of flue gas from a coal-fired electricity-generation plant. Finally, testing in a lab-scale reactor will be used to demonstrate that sorbent with particular metal center and optimal amine loading has capacity and desorption performance that is capable of meeting target of $30\/metric ton of CO2 captured and 95% purity desorption production, as stated by the subtopic 18b of this FOA."

        "abstract": "The DOE has invested heavily in the NEAMS toolkit with a goal of providing researchers and engineers with high fidelity tools that can be used to inform lower-order models for the design, analysis and licensing of advanced nuclear systems and experiments. Given the high stakes nature of nuclear power generation, it is essential that all NEAMS code, including the core tools and end-user driven and written simulations, are verified and validated using the industry best practices.RNET is proposing a verification and validation toolkit that provides the developers and end-users of nu- merical simulation software, including the NEAMS toolkit, with the tools required to create, implement, execute and document a thorough verification and validation plan for all numerical simulations.The Phase I work will develop an initial prototype of the verification and validation toolkit, including the development of a tool for automating the mesh refinement studies, a tool for comparing results from two or more simulations and a prototype graphical user interface (GUI). At the completion of the Phase I project, users will be able to integrate these new tools into an existing code base, run the tests and post-process the results through the GUI.Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: The verification and validation toolkit will be applicable in all forms of numerical simulations. End-users of open-source numerical simulation tools will be attracted to the toolkit as it provides them with a simple GUI through which they can setup, execute and analyze a comprehensive verification and validation plan. Likewise, the developers of numerical simulation software will be attracted to the toolkit because it positions V&amp;V as an integral component of the design process, ultimately reducing the time spent fixing bugs and reducing the time to market. Moreover, by allowing the developers to embed the V&amp;V tools in their codes, the toolkit gives developers a simple method to shipping software with built in support for end-user level V&amp;V."

        "abstract": "Superconducting magnets are used to manipulate particles in high energy physics. The windings of superconducting magnets must be monitored to ensure that temperature does not rise above the superconducting transition. Such a \u201cquenching\u201d accident caused $10M damage and shut down the large hadron collider at CERN for a year. A method for monitoring temperature that is immune to electrical noise is needed. Nitrogen vacancy (NV) or silicon vacancy (SiV) diamonds offer a way to monitor temperature optically. The NV center has spin sublevels split by D0 \u2248 2.8 GHz, while the SiV center has sublevels split by 50 GHz. These values are comparable to kT = 100 GHz at 5 K, the coil temperature, therefore the relative populations are sensitive to small changes in temperature. Fiber-optic readout of the populations ensures excellent immunity to electrical noise. The Phase I research will investigate spectroscopic techniques for measuring the sublevel population in both NV and SiV to determine temperature. In addition, the research will investigate fiberized designs that allow the probe to be integrated with superconducting coils. Successful Phase I and Phase II will lead to sales of probes and readout electro-optics for measuring temperature in cryogenic systems. Additional commercial markets include temperature monitoring for Magnetic Resonance Imaging."

        "abstract": "The increase in CO2 in atmosphere can be attributed to vehicular emissions, coal\/natural gas power plants, and industrial processes. CO2 removal from atmosphere is considered critical for reducing climate change effects; Current CO2 capture is performed using amine-based scrubbing systems via absorption\u2013regeneration technology. However, amine based CO2 removal is energy intensive and not cost-effective. Another challenge with current scrubbers is amine-based corrosion of process equipment and pipes. Therefore, there is a need for alternative solutions for reducing CO2emissions on an industrial scale using cost effective techniques. Activated carbons have been investigated as suitable candidates for CO2 capture. They do not require any moisture removal prior to CO2 absorption, they can absorb CO2 at ambient pressures and are easy to regenerate. Compared to zeolites, which have also been proposed as CO2 absorbed, activated carbonshave advantages such as lower cost, higher hydrophobicity, and ~50% lower energy requirements for regeneration. However, compared to zeolites, activated carbon have lower CO2 absorption capacity, which in turn is dependent on the surface area, pore size distribution, and surface chemistry. The first two properties is inherent to the activated carbon material used. Recently, we have been working on ultra-high surface area carbon powder, where we significantly increase the surface area of powder activated carbon by controlled burning of a polymer substrate material over an elongated period of time. The resultant carbon material consists of stacked graphite sheets; we have demonstrated surface area of &gt;3500 m2\/g, compared to 1000 m2\/g for commercially activated carbon powder, ~2000 m2\/g for specialty activated carbon powder such as Kuraray 50 PF, and ~3000 m2\/g for graphite\/graphene based powders. Additionally, the pores of the activated carbon possess the right distribution in terms of meso and micropores, which is required for efficient carbon dioxide adsorption. The material is produced via a scalable process, and costs comparable to commercially available specialty activated carbon powder, but much less than graphene\/graphite powders. In this Phase 1 proposal, we will evaluate extruded form of ultra high surface are carbon as CO2adsorbent under conditions similar to post-combustion CO2 capture in a fixed-bed adsorption unit. We will test the material for CO2\/N2 selectivity, reversible adsorption, cyclability and durability. Finally, a cost benefit analysis will be performed to compare the carbon dioxide capture potential of the activated carbon presented here with current state-of-the-art technologies."

Ideally, such a monitoring system should be sensitive and selective to gas compositional components (both major and minor), measure rapidly (seconds), and be reliable, compact, and ruggedly packaged for industrial installation. In addition, such a system would preferably include \u201csmart\u201d features such as on- board signal processing, self-calibration, built-in test, and supporting digital\/data bus communications for compliance with industry integrated instrumentation data systems. Sporian Microsystems has previously developed a compact breathing air monitoring system for the US Navy based on Raman spectroscopy that is capable of simultaneous real-time detection of gas components and contamination. Whilecapable of meeting many of the performance requirements in fuel gas composition monitoring applications, development efforts are needed to translate the technology, and the technology could benefit from adopting emerging cavity-enhanced and\/or capillary\/waveguide Raman strategies as well as packaging modifications to a rugged energy industry suitable format. Thus, the long term-objective of the proposed effort is to leverage Sporian\u2019s prior work on Raman spectroscopy monitoring systems, and introduce cavity-based enhancement and\/or capillary\/waveguide strategies to realize the required inexpensive, reliable, real-time fuel gas composition monitoring system. The phase I effort will include: 1) working with technical partners and industry stakeholders to define system requirements; 2) evaluating and defining hardware\/electronics architectures and designs, 3) and proof-of-principle testing\/demonstration using benchtop-scale prototypes of both a cavity enhanced and capillary\/waveguide based hardware."

        "abstract": "In the energy industry, there currently is not a satisfactory solution for measurement of coal mass flow at the inlet of each burner of the boiler. Accurate monitoring of this fuel injection rate is important as it can provide the instantaneous feed information to the boiler and thereby the instantaneous combustion efficiency of the boiler can be ascertained. In a commercial coal-fired system, the coal injection to the pulverized combustor is made at multiple locations of the boiler through multiple injecting pipes connecting to the central coal hopper. The total feed rate to the boiler can be readily measured from the discharge rate from the central coal hopper. However, their precise distribution from the central hopper to each injecting pipe is usually not known. Knowing the instantaneous coal injection rate in the pipe to the boiler is essential to providing timely action to correct for maldistribution and ensure sufficient air- to-coal flow ratio is provided for complete combustion. The current detection of maldistribution of the coal feeding from the central hopper is based on the mal-performance of downstream combustion system performance such as low steam generation rate. Clearly, a delay in detection of the feeder maldistribution can affect the prolonged low boiler efficiency and hence economics of the boiler system. Tech4Imaging, LLC (T4I) will develop a capacitance-based feed forward real- time control system for measuring mass flow rates of feedstock for flex-fuel mode power plant operations. This Electrical Capacitance Volume Tomography (ECVT) multi-phase flow meter project will result in a commercially viable solution for adjusting inlet fuel feed based on online, real-time evaluation and measurement to control power generation efficiencies that will result in lower total operating costs. In addition, the system will be designed to operate in remote areas, and operation will not require highly-specialized training, thus allowing for employment of a locally available labor force. The proposed combination of capacitance sensors, with their proven ability to measure multiple flow components, in conjunction with software developed to assess these measurements as an operational control measure, will enable more control of power plant operations. In Phase I of this project, we will focus on the development of algorithms to determine volume fractions and velocities of multiple phases, and validation of measurements on a controlled multi-phase flow loop. These developments will move the innovation through Technology Readiness Level 5, where laboratory experiments will validate the proof-of-concept that an ECVT multi-phase flow meter can address this industrial issue."

Sep-All unique technology is a platform based on chemo-mechanical stresses and interface metastability at the microscale to drive a controlled separation of mixed sources into high-value micro- and nano-materials of purified compounds (e.g. oxides, acetates), without the need to operate at high temperatures. Sep-All plans to extend its product line to the fabrication of \u2018critical materials\u2019 (materials with high supply risks and high environmental impact during ore processing). Sep- All has proved the applicability (in a laboratory setting) of the technology for the recovery of neodymium (a rare-earth element) from hard-drive magnet wastes and indium. More R&amp;D efforts must be carried to establish the commercial relevance and viability of the manufacturing operations. In addition to the health and environmental benefits offered by Sep-All\u2019s novel technological approach, our innovative platform could also potentially decrease U.S. interdependency on other countries for the supply stream of critical materials (e.g. the U.S. relies on China for &gt;90% of their supply Neodymium and Indium), which is also a DOE priority."

        "abstract": "The high\u2010energy physics (HEP) community has identified integral field spectroscopy (IFS) as an area that could dramatically leverage investments in current and future sky surveys for the study of dark energy. Many lines of evidence now agree that most mass in the universe is in the form of dark matter, which interacts mainly via the force of gravity. Identification and detailed phenomenology of dark matter remain poorly understood. Although the last few years have seen significant progress in understanding these phenomena, the most important issues are still open and two requirements have emerged as important in obtaining better understanding: 1) obtaining spatially resolved spectroscopic data is essential; and 2) multi\u2010object survey capabilities need to be extended to the near infrared (NIR). The integral field unit (IFU) is the most critical part of the spectrograph, and optical components also typically comprise a major portion of an IFS\u2010equipped telescope\u2019s capital budget, and its development time often paces the entire science project. Currently, three techniques are used in IFU optics: mirror\u2010slicers, fiber\u2010slicers and micro\u2010pupil\u2010arrays. Challenges common to each are: 1) obtaining high optical throughput (efficiency); 2) eliminating spectrum\u2010to\u2010spectrum crosstalk; 3) reducing Siedel and chromatic aberrations so diffraction\u2010limited spot sizes and uniform focal lengths are achieved across the spectral range; and 4) achieving high contrast. Due to deficiencies in addressing these challenges, existing IFS instruments cannot deliver the performance required for efficient dark energy surveys.Using additive manufacturing (AM) of 3D freeform gradient\u2010index optics, IFU optics will be developed that offer diffraction\u2010limited performance over the ~0.4 \u2013 2.2\u2010\u03bcm spectral range. AM gradient\u2010index optics will be shown capable of correcting for geometric and chromatic aberrations, which\u2014combined with integral pinholes and baffles\u2014allow for the high signal\u2010to\u2010noise ratio (SNR), high contrast, and spectral resolution that must be achieved to meet the needs of HEP sky surveys at low cost. The ability to rapidly design, fabricate, and replicate IFU optics will be shown to benefit multiplexed\u2010aperture IFS instruments. A series of microlens arrays and stacked microlens assemblies will be fabricated and characterized. Microlens arrays (MLAs)\u2014ranging in format from 32 x 32 to 200 x 200 elements, with square and hexagonal sampling, on pitches 120 \u03bcm to 3 mm\u2014will be fabricated. The combined optical materials and fabrication technology will be shown to have reduced geometric and chromatic aberrations. The devices will be shown to have uniform foci over large areas, with near diffraction\u2010limited performance across the spectral range. After demonstrating feasibility, fully functional IFU optical assemblies, including micro\u2010pupil array and micro\u2010pupil\u2010fiber slicer assemblies will be fabricated, characterized, and demonstrated with a spectrograph.The printed 3D freeform lens technology allows complex optical assemblies to be implemented in thin planar optical films with a minimal number of components. The value of the innovation is best realized: in high\u2010performance optical systems, where the size, weight, and cost are necessarily dominated by the optics; and in miniature optical assemblies, where performance is constrained by size and weight restrictions. Applications include smaller more\u2010 efficient optics for high\u2010power industrial lasers, lower\u2010mass solar concentrators, 3D displays, head\u2010mounted displays, CMOS imager lens arrays, and camera lenses."

        "abstract": "Bunches of charged particle are created by all accelerators due to the nature of the acceleration process. The temporal bunch length is a fundamental accelerator parameter that determines how the accelerator is performing and how it can be optimized, e.g. to make useful radiation. Bunch length is difficult to measure especially as the beam pulses become very short, e.g. microns or less. We have developed a new method to measure the average bunch length over a very wide range of sizes that is simple, easy to implement and less costly than other techniques. In Phase I we propose to validate this method experimentally. We propose to experimentally test and validate our new diagnostic on two electron beam accelerators with much different energies and bunch lengths and compare our results to standard diagnostic techniques. The technique we are developing requires imaging the spatial and angular distributions of coherent radiation generated by the charged particle (e.g. electron) bunch as it passes through a hole or through a foil. Before making our measurements, we will first estimate using computer simulations the ranges of beam parameters (e.g. the energy and the range of bunch lengths) that are expected for a particular accelerator, in order to design our experimental imaging system. We will then image the radiation, analyze the data to produce the bunch length and compare our results to other available diagnostics in order to validate our new method. There are over 30,000 accelerators in the world. All of these machines require a complement of diagnostics to operate and optimize their performance. A successful validation of the technique we are developing could lead to a commercial product that would be useful to a large number of accelerators with energies in the range of 10 to 12,000 million electron volts. These machines are used for a great variety of scientific and practical applications, e.g. drivers for x-ray free electron lasers, nuclear physics research, medical therapies and materials processing to name only a few."

        "abstract": "Optical sensing for nuclear detonation detection involves space\u2010based detection within the visible wavelength. Emerging optical detectors will leverage unique diffractive optics to help enhance and discriminate signals of interest from other background emitters. Because of the precision required to achieve these objectives, innovative designs and manufacturing methods are required to benefit Nuclear Detonation Detection (NDD) and commercial applications with similar signal discrimination requirements. These, space\u2010based imaging systems are examples of the types of systems that can bene\ufb01t from the perspective of increased degrees of freedom or increased size of the trade space. Many of these types of systems experience dynamic instabilities that are due to thermal and or mechanical variations of the system. Adequate control of the systems can generally be performed by a variety of optical and mechanical means, although, for many applications, the \ufb02exibility of the systems in terms of size, weight, or cost can be severely compromised. Increasing the number of methods that can be used to control the systems increases the degrees of freedom of the system or size of trade space. Increasing the degrees of freedom or size of the trade space can allow the designer added \ufb02exibility to minimize the size, weight, and cost of the system. To address the need for compact lightweight robust optics that can integrate both complex optical functions and chromatic compensation, diffractive and 3D freeform gradient\u2010index (GRIN) optical materials will be developed that combine the benefits of freeform surfaces with freeform optical\u2010index materials, to implement complex higher\u2010order polynomial optical functions. Possibilities for using diffractive and GRIN lenses as components of imaging optical systems have been investigated for several decades. The elements have proved competitive in their unique focusing and aberration properties and in terms of their additional degrees of freedom for optical design, and high optical characteristics can be achieved for simple systems consisting of a few elements combined in a variety of ways. In Phase I, we will demonstrate the VIRGO technology capable of manufacturing robust, space\u2010compatible freeform GRIN and diffractive optical elements. After refining the optical system requirements, we will design and demonstrate: 1) 3D freeform GRIN pupil masks and phase corrector plates; 2) achromatic freeform GRIN lens elements; 3) gradient\u2010index zone lens (similar to Fresnel lenses, but implemented with gradient contours); 4) freeform\u2010surfaced (including aspheric and off\u2010axis) 3D freeform GRIN lenses; and 5) metasurfaced freeform GRIN lenses. These elements will be used to show the ability to simultaneously achieve optical power, geometric aberration correction, and chromatic aberration correction, in a single monolithic element. We will employ the rising notation of pupil engineering, which incorporates techniques for controlling the spread of the axial point spread function, as well as methods for governing the impact of focus errors on the modulation transfer function. We will also perform preliminary environmental testing that will show that the technology can withstand typical launch loads as specified in MIL\u2010STD\u20101540 or the NASA General Environmental Verification Standard (GEVS: GSFC\u2010STD\u20107000) with respect to environmental and outgassing conditions typical of space\u2010based payloads launched and operating in space."

This novel wire design, combined with thermal \u2013 mechanical densification and OP processes, will enable vital improvements in the performance of a variety of large accelerator type magnets, as well as NMR and other field boosting magnet systems. Additionally, it is a promising candidate for use in next- generation large-scale commercial applications in the electric power industry, such as high-powered but lighter-weight and more efficient wind generators. The Phase 1 program will establish the feasibility of achieving much higher current density, round and rectangular 2212\/Ag wire, by using uniform one bundle architectures that eliminate the wasted space that occurs in double bundle architectures, and that, combined with our improved silver chemistry, will enable more uniform 2212 densification, with better texturing and 2212 formation during OP. Additionally, these designs have the potential to be produced at lower cost than present Bi2212\/Ag wires. The approach for producing these wires and achieving these results will be established by building on our experience in the design and manufacture of high Je Bi2223\/Ag (1G) tapes, specifically, 1) increasing the amount of the Bi2212 in the wire to about 35% from 25%, 2) modifying the chemical composition of the silver sheath adjacent each filament so the Bi2212 chemistry is not changed in OP, and 3) greatly decreasing variability of filament cross-sectional shapes and longitudinal variability."

        "abstract": "Fossil fuel power generation plants risk interruptions of service caused by malicious attacks from insider threats and cybercriminals. Although cyber warfare threatens all sectors of the United States\u2019 critical infrastructure, the energy sector\u2019s reliance on networked industrial control systems renders it particularly vulnerable to cyberattacks; therefore, comprehensive situational awareness of power plant health, operation, and cybersecurity has become critical to keeping the power on. The proposal team will create an automated situational awareness tool that adapts their proven, patented cyber feature-extraction and behavior analysis platform to provide comprehensive, simultaneous coverage of fossil power plant industrial control systems, information technology networks, and physics access control systems. The tool will perform data fusion upon networked sensor outputs to characterize nominal operational modes, and then use data analytics to detect deviations from those modes, in order to determine which anomalous conditions correspond to malicious behavior, and to alert system operators to emerging cyber incidents. The enabling platform employs a temporal aggregation methodology that models dynamic, emergent threat behaviors and models the behaviors of known threats. The methodology is threat-centric: it categorizes the behavior of network entities, instead of being a standard alert- or alarm-centric approach that classifies individual network incidents without associating them to entities. Aggregated behavior analysis will make the proposed situational awareness tool uniquely adept at discovering malicious entities that attempt multiple vectors across an attack surface and attacks that unfold over varied timescales. During Phase I, the proposal team will research and characterize the sensor types available in the domain, obtain representative data sets, determine attack surfaces over the range of fossil power plant types, develop power plant health models, map power plant network architecture to threat models, determine system integration requirements, and design a prototype human-machine interface. During execution of the three Small Business Innovation Research project phases, the proposed automated tool will ultimately provide situational awareness for the full range of fossil fuel power generation infrastructure. After developing requirements and design in Phase I, the proposal team envisions developing a single-position prototype in Phase II for delivery in Phase III. The Phase III effort will add distributed capabilities to the tool that will allow fossil fuel power plant owners and operators to coordinate their detection of area-wide anomalous conditions, obtain the information they need tomitigate them, and ultimately to share their detected threat behavior information with other facilities. The successful execution of this vision will greatly contribute to the resilience, safety, and reliability of the critical power generation infrastructure of the United States."

        "abstract": "The integration of silicon anodes, with their high theoretical specific capacity (4200 mAh\/g vs. 372 mAh\/g for the conventional graphite anode), into Li-ion cells and subsequent battery packs can significantly increase their energy density, which will assist in extending the range of electric vehicles. However, they suffer from low rapid capacity fade (low cycle-life) due to physical (mechanical fracturing) and chemical (Solid Electrolyte Interface [SEI] layer overgrowth) degradation during repeated cycling. To increase the cycle-life of Si as an anode in Li-ion batteries, we propose to develop a novel Si anode with an advanced artificial SEI layer to prevent the physical and chemical degradation experienced during battery charge and discharge cycles. In Phase I, Triton Systems Inc. will explore a family of Si anode materials with electron and Li- ion conducting properties. Once characterized, the advanced Si material will be deposited on a Cu current collector to be used as an anode material in full-cell battery coin-cell prototypes that are greater than 200mAh in size. Battery prototypes will be tested in accordance with applicable test procedures as published by the Department of Energy (DOE) and the U.S Advanced Battery Consortium (USABC) found at www.uscar.org\/guest\/article_view.php?articles_id=86."

        "abstract": "Brown grease, from trap grease and wastewater floatable mass, has substantial potential as a raw material to produce sustainable biofuels and biochemicals, but high sulfur, water, and impurities contents make processing difficult or end products outside of specifications. A good percentage of brown grease ends up in landfills. This project addresses the ability to turn brown grease into clean product compounds on a scale in line with regional brown grease outputs. This project will demonstrate the feasibility of turning brown grease into valid biofuels and other high-value biochemicals. A proprietary hydrothermal catalysis flow process performed at supercritical water conditions will use only brown grease, water, and renewable co-catalysts as input materials.A fixed catalyst is expected to be fully regenerable for a long indefinite lifetime. Catalysts, co-catalysts, temperature, pressure, and input concentrations will be varied and bioproducts will be analyzed to optimize the best yield and high-value output. At optimal conditions, brown grease will be converted into a product biocrude liquid mixture that will be separated by membrane filtration and distillation techniques into fuel fractions and pure compounds. Complete output values will be used to develop engineering and economic plans for a scale-up in Phase II that will model a commercialization facility. This novel process would produce renewable bioproducts with the potential to economically compete and replace a considerable volume of petroleum-based compounds in industrial markets with biofuels: biogasoline, biojet, and biodiesel, as well as green monomers, solvents, and synthetic pharmaceutical precursors.The minor percentage of brown grease converted to product hydrocarbon gases can be used as process heating fuel.Besides fuels, there is potential to create sustainable materials such as recyclable plastics that are currently only derived from petroleum cracking processes."

        "abstract": "Ridgetop Group, Inc. and the University of Arizona will deliver a cyber-secure condition based maintenance (CBM) solution for legacy fossil fuel based power plants. The technology consists of methods to \u201cmine\u201d and condition existing sensor data available in the plant\u2019s critical subsystems, send the data using Blockchain encryption methods, then application of multi-variate analysis of the sensor data streams against prescribed limits to detect operational anomalies and possible intrusions from external threats. Blockchains will be developed for data protection, and multivariate statistical methods will be invented to analyze multiple sensor data to assess state of health and discover anomalies. Difference method variance and their combinations will be developed and compared in a simulation testbed. Our vendor- independent solution will provide an extensible CBM infrastructure to legacy power plants that otherwise would be neglected due to the age or uniqueness of the equipment in use. For example, a plant may have a turbine from one supplier, a generator from another, and an instrumentation cluster provided by yet a third supplier. Ridgetop\u2019s open Internet of Things (IoT) smart sensor approach will support on-going monitoring of key assets to identify anomalies in plant systems or subsystems. Upon reception and processing of incoming sensor data, anomalies are quickly identified, with alerting made by a companion CBM monitoring platform. Sensor data integrity is assured through the application of open-ledger Blockchain technology to avoid any possibility of sensor data corruption from external threats. After the design of experiments is completed, the Simulink power plant model testbed and Blockchain- enabled sensor streams will be constructed. The tools will be integrated, the methodology tested, different methods compared, and best alternatives are chosen. Based on the results, countermeasures will be developed and tested. And finally, all works will be documented and final report prepared."

        "abstract": "The energy shortage and environment pollution are two serious issues worldwide for human beings, which call for ever-increasing demand towards renewable energy production, efficient energy utilization and environmental protection. Efficient enabling and utilization of various functional devices represent an essential solution to pursue the environment and energy sustainability. Nanotechnology is emerging as an effective approach to improve the efficiency of functional devices for a variety of applications such as light harvesting, energy storage, gas sensing and emission control. Scalable integration of functional nanostructural entities such as nanoparticles, nanowires, nanosheets into applicable three-dimensional (3-D) platform holds the keys of industrial-relevant manufacture of these functional devices. Among all the integration approaches, the wet-chemical based integration is one of the top options due to its advantages in low-cost, flexibility in substrate geometry and composition, ease of operation, and high repeatability. The wet-chemical based processes usually require continuous heating to initiate the chemical reactions, which is regularly achieved by conventional resistive heating.However, such conventional heating method is plaqued by a poor heating efficiency. Moreover, the conventional heating is not suitable for those substrates with three-dimensional (3D) or complex geometry since it hardly provides sufficient heat transfer and mass transport within substrates, leading to poor uniformity of nanostructure deposition and low production rate. Thus, there is urgent demand to develop high-efficiency wet-chemical based integration strategy for nanostructured functional devices. In this project, we propose to develop a novel microwave-irradiation-intensified hydrothermal manufacturing process for scalable manufacture of nanostructured monolithic devices. A wide array of metal oxide nanostructured coatings will be in situ grown on various 3D substrates such as ceramic honeycombs. To improve the growth efficiency, production rate, and distribution uniformity of various nanostructures, microwave irradiation will be introduced to substitute conventional heating sources such as oven and water bath. Mechanical agitation will be used to induce continuous mass transport in substrates. The microwave-induced enhancement on growth efficiency will be investigated with respect to the resulting chemical and physical characteristics of prepared nanostructured devices. The synthesis and processing protocols will be optimized by studying a variety of parameters including microwave power output, pulse frequency and solution flow dynamics. Finally, the production rate of proposed integration strategy will be compared with the typical batch process being used in current industrial manufacturing of nanostructured devices. As a proof of concept, a couple of scale-up monolithic devices will be fabricated and validated as field-relevant catalytic reactors emission control and other environmental remediation."

        "abstract": "Computational physicists and diagnosticians need to analyze 3-Dimensional data to gain understanding of their simulations or diagnostic results. Visualizing 3D Physics effects by use of 2D screens can limit understanding or even create misunderstandings. Communication of results between collaborators can be difficult when using 2D images or movies, sent by email with written explanations: one finds oneself repeating or missing important information. 3D models can be seen with the use of stereoscopic motion-tracking head-mounted displays such as Oculus VR\u2019s Oculus Rift or Microsoft\u2019s Hololens. These devices attach to the head like oversized ski goggles and project separate images to each eye creating an illusion to the user of a 3-dimensional immersive space. By immersing the user into a virtual reality, the user can more easily visualize, explore, and interact with their data. By augmenting the reality of the user with holograms, they can view, explore, and interact their data with colleagues as if it were physically in the room with them. Full 3D data already is collected by computational physicists and diagnosticians. Existing simulation code and diagnostics data would not need to be modified for use with this program. Additionally, Oculus VR\u2019s Oculus Rift can be used in a collaborative fashion. Multiple scientists could both view and interpret a data-set in real-time, facilitating quick and accurate information transfer. We propose to develop a Physics Visualization tool for use with major commercial VR\/AR head-mounted display products and open-source visualization software Paraview\u2019s virtual reality interface. Common data visualization models such as contour, pseudocolor, vector, etc, will be available to the user. The visualization tool will use existing data formats like HDF5 and VTK to facilitate use with existing datasets. Additionally, we propose to develop the tool to allow multiple users to interact with the same dataset in real-time from HPC systems building off of Paraview\u2019s remote interactive visualization capabilities. During Phase I, we will develop the prototype software implementation (Alpha testing) and in Phase II the demonstration version, and do beta-testing using customer input."

        "abstract": "Current hydropower facilities employ a variety of electrical and mechanical equipment that necessitate the use of lubricants to ensure efficient operation of said equipment. The lubricants, either oils or greases, aid in reducing friction, dissipating heat, prevent oxidation, and seal of water and debris from vital areas of the equipment. During operation, equipment may be submerged or otherwise come in contact with water, posing a risk of the lubricant leaking into a sensitive environment. The purpose of this SBIR Program is to develop a biodegradable lubricant to replace non-biodegradable lubricants currently utilized in hydropower facilities. Development and deployment of a biodegradable lubricant minimizes the risk of a hazardous chemical spill into a watershed or other sensitive environment. The goal of this Phase I program is to generate a spectrum of lubricating fluids from biodegradable and renewable materials that can serve as stand-alone products or as components in a formulated system which can address the performance requirements in hydropower and marine lubricants. The general approach to this research is to synthesize a series of lubricants and evaluate their base physical properties to down-select promising candidates for in-depth property analysis, for the targeted commercial application. In Phase I, a multi-level factorial design will be generated to define the composition of the lubricants and to analyze the effects of said composition on the physical properties of the synthetic lubricant. Prior work has shown that this type of experimental design will generate predictive performance data for all compositions within the boundaries of the design matrix. Lubricants generated during this Phase I program will be analyzed for thermal properties, viscometrics, and wear properties utilizing standard test methods and practices. The commercial applications and general public benefits of this technology are numerous. The Environmental Protection Agency and the European Ecolabel for Lubricants currently have restrictions in place regarding the use of environmentally acceptable lubricants. Marine lubricants- for commercial vessels and those over 75 feet in length require the use of environmentally acceptable lubricants, so there is a market sector presently in place with few options that satisfy both cost and performance demands. Development of a successful lubricant under this Phase I SBIR would provide the market with a product that meets biodegradability\/toxicity requirements while providing cost and performance benefits versus currently utilized environmentally acceptable lubricants. Beyond the current marine market, the development of a cost-effective high performance biodegradable lubricant could have dramatic effects on applications like agriculture, construction, off-road vehicles, and personal watercraft."

        "abstract": "Geothermal energy is a nearly inexhaustible renewable and clean energy resource. The benefits of geothermal energy include high base load, dispatchability, and long-term stability of geothermal wells under exploitation. However, lack of information on how wells should be properly balanced between production and artificial replenishing puts wells at risk of being over exploited, which can permanently damage the ability of the wells to produce, leading to the incurring of additional cost and the loss of energy resources. Moreover, well information is especially crucial when operating a geothermal plant in a dispatchable mode because changes in well operations performed in accordance with oscillating energy demands could potentially cause even greater damage to exploited wells. We propose a solution for this challenging problem by developing a data fusion algorithm that will serve as an analysis tool for operating current geothermal power plants in a flexible mode. This innovative solution will combine enthalpy measurements from our TRL 6 two-phase mass flow meters with other well performance metrics (such as pressure, temperature, wellhead scaling, power demand, and costs of operation\/curtailment of each well) to optimize well operations, thereby enabling geothermal energy to be more widely deployed as a dispatchable electricity source. Phase I key outcomes will be a functioning field-tested prototype sensor that can withstand the harsh conditions of the geothermal surface pipelines for long term deployment, an algorithm that calculates two phase mass flow rates of steam and water using measurements from the sensor, and an algorithm for how the mass flow, enthalpy measurements and other well performance metrics can be used to optimize the efficiency of a dispatchable geothermal plant when operating in flexible mode. In Phase I of this project, we will validate our solution for dispatchable geothermal operations by field testing using our mass flow sensor at operational geothermal wells. We have agreements with two geothermal well owners to host this testing. Mass flow and enthalpy measurements will be taken inline and validated against tracer flow tests (TFTs) conducted by an independent geothermal company. Results of the testing, as well as sample well performance data, will be used to iterate algorithm development until a satisfactory level of thoroughness and accuracy has been reached as validated by an independent geothermal company."

        "abstract": "In topic 11.b, Dispatchable Geothermal Operations, the Department of Energy (DOE) seeks to enable more widespread deployment of geothermal as a dispatchable energy source, permitting expansion of geothermal power in general and as a compliment to growing intermittent energy sources. TerraCOH\u2019s CO2 Plume Geothermal (CPG\u2122) and Earth Battery\u2122 technologies are ideally suited to meet and exceed this objective. Presently, geothermal is one of the least expensive ways to produce electricity, but it has been geographically limited to areas with very high subsurface temperatures and plentiful water. Additionally, conventional technologies have largely been limited to continuous operation to ensure equipment and reservoir stability, as well as maintain low power production costs. TerraCOH\u2019s technologies constitute a continuum of cost-effective applications for using the earth\u2019s geothermal heat for both the generation of renewable power and large-scale geologic energy storage. Our solutions are innovative in their use of non-water fluids, and combinations of water and non-water fluids, to harness geothermal heat and store energy in subsurface formations. By using non-water fluids \u2013 primarily CO2 \u2013 we will be able to dramatically expand the areas in the US where geothermal power and energy storage can be economically deployed, from ~1% to ~50% of the US land area. Stored CO2 can play three important roles: 1) a working fluid for efficient, low water- intensity energy conversion in Brayton Cycle turbines, 2) a supplemental fluid that creates pressure to recirculate working fluids, and 3) a shock absorber that allows diurnal\/seasonal energy storage. The primary objective of our Phase 1 study is to modify our existing, extensive, coupled geophysical-mechanical numerical models of CPG\u2122 systems, from continuous or cyclical operation to allow for true dispatchable analyses. Our models can permit diurnal\/seasonal variations in production, so the next step is to allow inclusion of real electricity supply\/demand curves from, for instance, an independent system operator. We must also tie in performance limitations (e.g., response times) provided by our equipment suppliers. From there, we will expand our Levelized Cost of Energy models to permit inclusion of ancillary benefits (e.g., peak shaving) that may be provided by dispatchable system operation. Our current economic models can only valuated straight power sales and credits."

        "abstract": "Buildings rarely perform as designed\/simulated and there are numerous tangible benefits if this gap is reconciled. Building energy simulations are essential not only during the design phase but also offer a number of benefits during building operation. Examples are commissioning, fault detection and diagnostics, identifying and evaluating retrofit opportunities, and especially optimal predictive control especially in the context of electrical grid services meant to assure\/enhance to assure reliability and flexibility with increasing renewable penetration. This project develops a scientific yet pragmatic methodology that focusses on parametric estimation rather than a blind forced-fit to energy use data. It starts with rapidly and inexpensively created simulation inputs and reconciles simulated energy and indoor temperatures with actual performance using readily available hourly or sub-hourly performance data from smart meters, building automation systems and local weather stations. Current calibration methods providing little physical insight into actual parameters and often over-promise accuracy. Rather than subjectively adjusting a large number of inputs based on Monte Carlo-type of random massive simulations, the new method will scientifically identify and estimate a small number of parameters and uncertainty bounds using a multi-stage process. The parameters will have direct physical significance. The residual error in energy balance is related to forcing functions using machine learning to enhance the accuracy of calibration. Thus the burden of arriving at a good final model is shared between initial inputs, calibration and machine learning. In Phase I, the development advances the state of the art by developing and applying the methodology to at least one synthetic building and one actual building. This proposal will perform major improvements especially in integrating the HVAC systems into the earlier methodology which has been applied to office buildings as large as 130,000 sq.ft. The project will also develop guidelines for next generation simulations to facilitate incorporation of calibration. In subsequent phases, the methodology and tool will be refined and coded to be ready for field deployment not only by the building energy services community, but also by utility services community facilitating creation of new markets and dispatch of flexibility services to the electrical grid."

        "abstract": "Parabolic trough solar collectors are well-suited to generating industrial steam, and their efficiency at making steam is a direct result of the precision with which they are assembled. State-of-the-art designs required placement of dozens of mirror panels to sub-millimeter accuracy so that the reflected light hits its target. That painstaking placement is performed today by extensive labor and expensive, non-mobile fixtures that result in high costs. Our mobile, automated assembly method, derived from recently developed aerospace techniques, lowers costs, improves safety and quality, and can be easily moved to new project construction sites. The cost savings achieved through the proposed automated assembly method is essential to achieve a cost of industrial heat consistent with the stated SunShot thermal goal of 1.5\u00a2\/kWh. The mirror panels are positioned and fastened to sub-millimeter accuracy using industrial robots guided by advanced optical metrology. This system is installed on a mobile platform that travels across the solar field. In Phase I we will demonstrate the feasibility of our approach through a combination of design, costing, and outdoor tests. Together, this work will address the key risks associated with metrology-guided robotic assembly for solar collectors, thereby substantially extending the methods used in aerospace assembly to an outdoor, mobile, environment."

        "abstract": "The SolarGuard project will address the problem of detecting malicious data injection (MDI) attacks on power transmission systems handling solar power. Such attacks could cause the power transmission system to become unstable, leading to blackouts and cascade failures. MDI can also be used to perfom, high-level application attacks disrupting applications in Energy Control Centers, from Energy Management Systems, such as frequency control, optimal power flow, adaptive protection, remedial action systems (RAS), congestion mitigation, real-time pricing, energy balancing of renewable variability, demand response, storage, etc.MDI attacks could thereby cause major blackouts and brownouts. The SolarGuard Phase I project, will establish the boundaries of the problem by identifying the relevant attack surface, and likely MDI attacks. We will explore attacks that originate from corrupting Internet of Things (IoT) devices of prosumers, attacks on substation software, and attacks that are enabled by physical access to substation and to distribution hardware (which is typically not carefully protected from access). We will also identify the data measurements available to estimate the state of the system and detect MDI. Based on this preliminary study, we will develop detector systems that combine first principles models of the electrical power grid with machine learning models based on empirical data. The former will identify malicious data that violates physical constraints given other measurements, and the latter will help handle model mismatch, and realistic noise models. In Phase I we will conduct a small test evaluation of the method, based on scenarios identified from the Northwest power grid, in order to establish the feasibility of the SolarGuard techniques. Evaluation will be based on measurements of precision and recall, and receiver operating characteristics evaluation of the tradeoffs between precision and recall."

        "abstract": "As atmospheric CO2 levels continue to rise, implementation of technologies for point source carbon emission (e.g. flue gas of coal-fired power plants) reductions are necessary for near-term carbon management strategies. Although current aqueous amine scrubbing technologies can achieve high levels of CO2 removal from flue gas, the thermal energy required reduces net plant power output by 20-35%, mainly as steam used for regeneration. The development of carbon capture processes with reduced energy usage and cost is of critical importance to rapid adoption of carbon capture processes. Solid adsorbents promise significant gains in energy efficiency owing to their reduced heat capacities and adsorption enthalpies, reducing energetic and economic costs of carbon capture when compared to traditional amine solutions. Specifically, a class of adsorbents developed at UC Berkeley that exhibit step-shaped CO2 isotherms has emerged as a promising candidate for CO2 removal from flue gas. The unique step-shaped isotherms offer two primary advantages: 1) large working capacities (10-16 wt%) can be realized at very low CO2 partial pressures, and 2) complete adsorbent regeneration can be accomplished with small changes in pressure and\/or temperature, yielding significant energy savings. Over a decade of research on these materials has enabled rational \u201ctuning\u201d of the adsorption behavior of these materials; however, they have not yet been incorporated into a low-energy separation process. In this Phase I SBIR, Mosaic Materials will perform the preliminary engineering research required to develop a low-energy, modular separation process for carbon capture from flue gas utilizing step-shaped CO2 adsorbents. Synthesis of a modular separation process imparts flexibility to separation size, requirements and deployment schemes currently not available with solution-based amine scrubbing technologies. Identification of the optimal number of CO2 removal steps (i.e. separation modules), in addition to ideal CO2 adsorption step location, will yield a process capable of utilizing low-grade waste heat for a bulk of the regeneration required reducing energy requirements compared to current methods. Further, production of high purity (&gt;95%) CO2 enables integration with emerging carbon utilization technologies. Completion of the preliminary engineering design will accelerate future development and validation phases of the high efficiency, low cost carbon capture process. Upon validation, rapid deployment of the modular capture process will dramatically reduce CO2 emissions with reduced derating of the associated power generation unit. Owing to the modular nature of the design proposed here, future adaptation to larger or smaller CO2 emission point-sources will be possible by simple addition or removal of already designed separation units. This project will expedite early commercialization and adoption of adsorbent-based flue gas carbon capture, benefitting both electricity generation and consumption markets."

        "abstract": "The inefficient flow of vehicles on our roadways expend tremendous amounts of energy idling or reaccelerating their mass in stop-and-go traffic. This results in significant wasted energy, greenhouse gas emission, vehicle and roadway wear and tear, and economic inefficiency. According to the Centre for Economics and Business Research, the annual effect of traffic congestion in the U.S. includes 871 million gallons of wasted fuel, 8,610 kilotons of CO2 emitted, and 6.8 billion hours of time wasted. Despite this, 99% of U.S. intersections are controlled by a fixed timer, and incumbent adaptive traffic control technologies have only penetrated 1% of the marketplace over 35 years due to high cost and poor efficacy. We are proposing to develop the next generation Cooperative Intelligent Transport System (C-ITS) that can significantly reduce transportation network energy consumption by deploying the latest control algorithms in conjunction with emerging mobility concepts and sensing and learning technologies (i.e., Internet of Things, machine learning). The C-ITS system we envision is specifically designed to address the key hurdles, efficacy and cost, which are preventing wide- spread adoption of adaptive traffic signal capabilities and are therefore preventing system-level energy, environmental, and economic benefit. We validate and refine the core algorithms in live traffic intersections that determine real-time green splits, offsets, and cycle time to optimize network level objectives, such as throughput, energy consumption, and travel time. Traditional approaches typically use a combination of myopic intersection-level optimization and ad hoc techniques for coordination between intersections. On the other hand, our approach solves the problem at the system level, and hence enforces coordination, which also prepares the system\u2019s level ground rules for emerging mobility concepts. A major thrust in our effort is to make these algorithms scalable. For this purpose, we adapt tools from information systems congestion control and distribution optimization to the transportation setting."

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I proposal addresses the development of Environmentally Acceptable Lubricants for hydropower plants. Eco-friendly lubricants are necessary to safeguard marine environments from lubricant leaks, spillage, or accidental release from malfunctioning systems or equipment. By developing the next generation of high performing lubricants using eco-friendly additives and oils which are non-toxic, biodegradable and non-bioaccumulative, this development work mitigates issues related to leaks, spills, and accidental release of today\u2019s commonly used petroleum-based lubricants to water. These incidents are notorious for causing economically and environmentally costly situations disastrous to aquatic life. The Phase I work focuses on developing environmentally friendly lubricants that are used for turbine and hydraulic systems in hydropower stations. This includes identifying and selecting suitable base stock oils which are thermally stable, biodegradable, non- toxic to the aquatic environment, and non-bioaccumulative. It also focuses on identifying, selecting, and optimizing treat levels of eco-friendly additives which are necessary ingredients for these specific lubricants to meet performance specifications for turbine oils and hydraulic fluids, as well as using industry standard tests on laboratory scale formulations to select the best formulated lubricant for additional optimization, scaling, and testing in Phase II."

        "abstract": "Controlling combustion dynamics in gas turbines continues to be a major challenge especially in advanced engine designs where, due to leaner flames, less cooling air and more turbulent injectors, there is a higher potential for damaging combustion dynamics. Therefore, for robust operation, large margins for static and dynamic stability are required. This can lead to higher than optimal emissions. It can be considered in this regard, that control of combustion dynamics can effectively set the NOx floor for a given turbine. Various active combustion control methods have been proposed and demonstrated, at least for gas turbine engines but they have not found wide-spread commercial use. Plasma has been shown to be a promising tool for flame stabilization with nanosecond-repetitively-pulsed-discharges (NSPD) in particular have gained popularity for their ability to create high electric fields and thus produce sufficient concentrations of excited species to enhance combustion. In addition, their rapid actuation time and efficiency make plasma an attractive actuator for active combustion control which can both improve both static stability via kinetic enhancement of reaction pathways and dynamic stability, especially if configured in a closed-loop configuration. Plasmas have already been demonstrated in literature to have positive effects on combustion dynamics. However, further work is necessary to understand the dynamics of flame response to plasma\u2019s, particularly at realistic conditions. To this end, this proposal will use explore a novel method of using plasma as an active control actuator in order to control combustion dynamics, thereby broadening operability and reducing emissions for industrial gas turbines. This combustor and its control system will be characterized both at atmospheric pressure as well as at high pressure and high temperature conditions representative of operation in a gas turbine engine. Various optical and acoustic diagnostics will be used to quantify the effectiveness of the plasma-assisted control system. At a high level, the goal of this work will be to a) develop and demonstrate an active combustion control system using nanosecond-pulsed plasmas as an actuator integrated into a realistic, lean-premixed injector and b) to reduce low-power CO emissions and lean blow off characteristics of the combustor by at least 20% with the aid of the proposed plasma system. If this work is successful, it will significantly de-risk the technology and enable partnerships with major engine manufacturers to bring this technology to market where this technology will provide a single point solution to a wide variety of combustion problems. This technology can therefore enable reduced emissions, lower fuel consumption and greater reliability from gas turbines for stationary power generation. This technology also has dual-use applications in jet engines for civil and military aviation."

        "abstract": "Semplastics will address two main problems through the proposed work: (1) the underutilization of coal, a valuable natural resource, has led to a catastrophic drop in employment within the coal industry ecosystem in specific geographic areas in the country; and (2) the fast-paced growth of the solar panel industry could ultimately be derailed by roof tile systems that do not meet that industry\u2019s requirements of long life, high mechanical durability, and low weight. Semplastics manufactures components using a patented process for producing polymer-derived ceramics (PDCs). PDCs have been used to create many useful end products, from clutches for racing cars, to brakes for conventional automobiles, to heat shields for spacecraft. Leveraging this technology, Semplastics has developed a novel composite material based on coal. The new coal-core composite (CCC) material offers promise for the beneficial utilization of large amounts of coal without burning it as fuel. Semplastics proposes to address the problems described above through the application of this technology to the creation of highly durable, lightweight, affordable roofing tiles. The proposed roofing tiles not only provide a high- volume outlet for coal, but also provide an American-made option for ceramic tiles. In Phase I, Semplastics will produce prototypes of the CCC-based roofing tile. This work will include optimization of the blending process to ensure scalability and to position the product for commercial production. The prototypes will be subjected to testing in local laboratory facilities to characterize the material properties, as well as testing by commercial laboratories to show compliance with roofing industry standards. The successful commercialization and market execution of these roofing tiles will produce an immediate impact in the coal industry ecosystem and will contribute to energy diversification across the United States, ultimately impacting the national economy by producing domestic manufacturing jobs. The CCC-based roofing tiles offer a viable, high volume, high growth end market for mined coal, which will yield positive technical, economic, and social benefits. In the long term, the Semplastics team expects that the CCC-based roofing tiles can contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions worldwide, as the roofing tiles would lock away coal and subsequently sequester CO2 from the atmosphere."

        "abstract": "The U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates that in 2017, the U.S. residential sector and the commercial sector used about 273 billion kilowatthours of electricity for lighting. This was about 10% of the total electricity consumed by both of these sectors and about 7% of total U.S. electricity consumption. Residential lighting consumption was about 129 billion kilowatthours or about 9% of total residential sector electricity consumption in 2017. Increasing the efficiency of current lighting technologies can be a substantial energy and cost saver. Currently, inorganic based light emitting diodes are the most efficient lighting present on the market. Even though traditional light emitting diodes lighting is currently the clear leader in efficiency, lifespan and cost savings, this might not be the case in the near future. When the basic semiconductor light emitting diode first hit the market, it was more expensive and less effective, but technological advances have reduced cost, while increasing efficiency. This is expected to be the same case as advancements are made in organic light emitting diodes technology. In fact, experts expect organic light emitting diodes lighting to be a $1.3 billion market by 2023. The transparent conducting electrode is one of the major constructive elements of the organic light emitting diodes. It provides the means to supply current to the light emitting material and allow generated light to escape from the diode, so it can be used for lighting purposes. Indium\u2013tin oxide is currently the most widely used as transparent conductive electrode. However, it has several drawbacks: (I) its cost has increased gradually owing to a scarcity of indium; (II) indium and tin ions that diffuse from the electrode to overlying organic layers can act as charge- trapping centers during the charge injection process, degrading the luminous efficiency and operational stability of organic light emitting diodes; (III) majority of the emitted light is trapped in the glass or plastic substrates (substrate mode) and the indium-tin oxide\/organic medium (waveguide mode) due to the refractive-index mismatch between these layers lowering efficiency of the organic light emitting diodes; (IV) indium tin oxide films are brittle, which makes them unsuitable for practical flexible electronics. In this SBIR program, scalable production methods for alternative materials for transparent conductive electrodes will be developed. We will improve the reproducibility of fabrication of reduced graphene oxide films on non-conductive substrates with control over the number of graphene layers in the films. Specific attention will be paid to develop low temperature graphene oxide reduction methods and optimization of the films for applications as transparent conductive electrodes for solid state lighting. Work function of the graphene films and sheet resistance will be optimized by chemical doping of the films. Electrically conductive, transparent graphene films can find potential applications in touchscreens, liquid crystal displays, organic photovoltaic cells, and organic light-emitting diodes. Large area, flexible graphene films are particularly suitable as indium tin oxide substitution in flexible electronics."

        "abstract": "Nuclear power plant (NPP) operators require accurate and timely information to maintain safe and efficient operation. Accurate and timely measurement of nuclear reactor neutron flux density is critical to monitoring and controlling the nuclear reaction process.The current state-of-the-art in nuclear reactor neutron flux density monitoring centers on in-core metal SPNDs or gas-filled fission chambers for in-core measurements (usually at a single remote location) and additional neutron detectors, such as fission or ion chambers in various ex-core locations. Current drawbacks with this status quo include: (1) Accuracy suffers due to the SPND sensitivity to both neutrons and gamma rays; (2) Gaps in neutron flux density measurements. Gaps in the flux density field surrounding the core and at specific distances from the core, require interpolation of values that results in measurement inaccuracies; (3) Relatively slow response of SPND ranging from seconds to minutes, times which are characteristically ill suited for safety monitoring; (4) Large volume (large form factor), usually much longer than 10 centimeters for fission chambers. This limits where detectors can be placed; (5) Highly enriched fissile materials are required for fission chambers. This proposal seeks to advance the state-of-the-art in neutron flux density measurement by proposing the development of an intelligent III-V GaN-based neutron flux detector array. This sensor array would augment the current in-core detectors. Phase I will develop a \u201csmall\u201d array configuration of multiple detectors that will prove the concept. Detailed advantages of the proposed technology will be measured in a test nuclear reactor setting. This can later be scaled to fully envelope the reactor core as part of Phase II. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:AAT believe that the core technology developed as part of the Phase I and Phase II efforts will be directly applicable to superior, low power radiation detection via widely distributed semi-conductor detectors. There is a broad market that a modified version of a low power radiation detector array can serve. Use cases in boarder security and smart city security are very much in line with the potential of the proposed technology."

        "abstract": "Developing a T-EBC coating capable of providing extended performance of sic CMCs in high temperature, water vapor gas turbine engine environments at 3100oF coupled with the need to resist degradation from external sand\/ salt ingestion is a daunting challenge. Of all the numerous studies by NASA, universities, private sector companies and other Federal laboratories, rare earth zirconia and hafnia compositions appear to offer the best resistance to both the water vapor laded combustion environment of turbine engines and molten sand degradation. TA&amp;T proposes to develop and demonstrate that rare earth multi-layer based EBcs&apos; have the potential to minimize SiOH2 reactions and volatilization with Sic substrate, restrict or delay CMAS interaction with EBC system, including liquid phase infiltration, develop self-healing capability once CMAS reactions occur and enable the bulk of the EBC coating to retain strain tolerance and toughness at 3100oF. Several variants of experimental EBC compositions will be explored using magnetron sputtering to deposit different multilayer compositions on SiC CMCs. Thin alternating multilayers have the advantages of reduced columnar growth, lower residual stress and reduced thermal conductivity compared to single layer coatings. In addition, the interfaces tend to deflect cracks. XRD, SEM and EDS characterization of the compositions, microstructures of the sputtered coatings will be used on iterative basis to arrive at the desired coating deposition parameters and coating properties. The experimental coatings will be subjected to isothermal dry air, flowing air-steam at 50% relative humidity without and with CMAS at 3100oF. Post-test analysis of delamination, cracking, phase changes, chemical interactions will be used to determine and compare the effectiveness of the graded EBC compositions to protect the Sic CMC substrates."

        "abstract": "Current solar panel racking systems are multicomponent and require pre-ordering, transporting, inventorying, and labor-intensive deployment. There is an opportunity for automation, especially in the case of flat-roof commercial installations, which would decrease costs. The proposed automated racking system produces the rack from raw material, on-demand and on-site during the automated installation process. The innovation is a single component rack, significantly simpler than current state-of-the art racking systems. It is fast and easy to install. There are three Phase I technical objectives. First, make a detailed design of the automated racking system including its geometry and material composition. Second, perform wind tunnel pressure tests that evaluate the effects of the wind deflector, unique geometry, and ballast required to secure the solar array to the rooftop. Third, prototype the racking system, verify its functionality, and verify the expected savings for commercial solar arrays."

        "abstract": "Coal is recognized as a primary energy resource used in the production of electricity and heat. Furthermore, coal is a very versatile commodity used in industrial processes such as refining metals and refined into coal tar, phenol, creosote oil, naphthalene and other chemicals. The objective in this research is to develop a silicon carbide foam, produced from domestic coal that has an open pore structure for molten salt containment and used in thermal storage systems forthe concentrated solar power industry.In addition, the silicon carbide foam will have high thermal conductivity that enhances heat transfer. The high use temperature of silicon carbide, combined with high heat transfer properties, potentially overcomes technical barriers that prevent implementation of closed loop supercritical carbon dioxide recompression Brayton cycle technology. Moving from steam (Rankin Cycle) to super critical carbon dioxide (Brayton Cycle) potentially increases thermal efficiency by almost 45% resulting in concentrated solar powerplant output 40% or more. For thermal energy storage systems used in concentrated solar power technology, and molten salt phase change materials in general, molten salt systems represent the most familiar approach. However, the increase in hot salt system temperature from 565 centigrade to about 720 centigrade brings significant material challenges. First, salts used for phase change materials have low thermal conductivity that are typically less than 1.0 (watt\/meter-kelvin). This corresponds to low heat transfer within the thermal energy storage system.The objective in this Phase I research isto develop and show feasibility that molten salt contained within the porosity of silicon carbide foam will significantly enhance heat transfer in thermal energy storage systems. Feasibility inPhase I will be demonstrated through defining the process and characterizing silicon carbide properties, which include thermal conductivity, corrosion resistance, microstructure and physical properties. In addition, cost feasibility will be demonstrated through the use of coal as feedstock and an innovative processing approach. The proposed technical approach is anticipated to significantly reduce silicon carbide production costs in contrast to current methods using petroleum-based foam feedstocks and chemical vapor infiltration or chemical vapor deposition conversion processes in the manufacture of silicon carbide. While the bulk of concentrated solar power electricity will come from large, on-grid powerplants, these technologies also show significant potential for supplying specialized demands such as process heat for industry, co-generation of heating, cooling and power, and water desalination. Concentrated solar power also holds potential for applications such as household cooking and small-scale manufacturing that are important for the developing world. Solar-generated hydrogen can help decarbonize the transport and other end use sectors by mixing hydrogen with natural gas in pipelines and distribution grids, and by producing cleaner liquid fuels."

        "abstract": "Large Li-ion factories are being built around the world in an attempt to dramatically lower cost through economies of scale.At the same time, new market opportunities are becoming accessible to Li-ion as the technology improves. For many of these technologies, the levelized cost of energy storage is the primary metric, not $\/kWh. Cycle life varies tremendously depending on cycling conditions, chemistry, cell design, and manufacturing quality. Cell manufacturers and storage integrators are very interested in new technologies that can improve the abuse tolerance of Li-ion batteries resulting in improved cycle life. But proving new technologies or even iterating on existing formulations is challenging given that under some load profiles Li-ion chemistries can cycle for many years. Such long evaluation timeframes are not conducive to technical advancement.New characterization techniques are required that provide rapid insight on capacity loss and degradation mechanisms with sufficient clarity to make informed design decisions. This project will develop a new battery characterization tool that allows the measuring of capacity loss rates of Li-ion batteries under a variety of specific use scenarios. Xilectric\u2019s proposed characterization technique provides insights not available from existing techniques providing a more complete picture of the capabilities of the variant of Li-ion chemistry under test.In particular, our technique is able to provide several measures of fidelity under realistic cycling conditions while avoiding artificial accelerated aging conditions such as extreme temperatures and potentials as well as full depth of discharge cycling. The information provided by the new test can be used to develop better battery management algorithms, to improve on cell design, and to select Li-ion formulations best suited to the end-user application. Once validated, Xilectric would expect strong commercial interest in the new device from various Li-ion cell manufacturers, end-users, researchers, and academic institutions."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this project will enable Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS or drones) to safely and reliably operate from moving vehicles and moving vessels at sea. There is an immediate need for this capability in many industries. In commercial fishing, drones will replace manned aircraft for fish-finding operations, radically reducing cost and risk. In maritime security, drones will provide surveillance around ships, including locating a ?man-overboard? in time to save the person?s life. In the oil and gas industry, drones will provide rapid-response to oil spills by mapping the location and extent of the oil slick, limiting the environmental and economic damage. In hydrographic surveying, drones will identify and geo-locate navigation aids, at a fraction of the time and cost of current survey methods. In commercial shipping, drones will inspect and protect shipping vessels while they are underway. In the transport industry, drones will delivery packages the ?last mile? from a delivery truck to a customer?s door. In law enforcement and border security, drones will operate from moving patrol vehicles while officers remain safe and mobile in the vehicle. These applications are currently difficult or impossible, but will become radically safer and easier with the proposed technology. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project will advance the current state of the art in UAS\/drone autonomy, to enable reliable drone operations from moving vehicles and moving vessels at sea. Shipboard landing is extremely difficult, due to the heaving and rolling of the ship deck, potential high winds, and the high precision control required during landing. Current drone technology does not facilitate landing on moving platforms; this prevents their use in maritime operations, and has become the main barrier to commercialization in this sector. The proposed research will develop a vision-aided relative navigation system that combines precise air-to-ship observations with onboard sensor measurements to accurately estimate the relative state between the drone and the ship. These relative state estimates will be used to dynamically route and control the drone safely on to the ship deck. Technical feasibility of this approach has been demonstrated during the Phase I project, which included demonstration of the technology in a relevant environment. The primary goals of the Phase 2 project are to improve system reliability, expand the operational envelope, and productize our system. The plan to achieve these goals includes scientific development paired with extensive testing, validation, and demonstration. This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) will be to develop a platform to accelerate the engineering of biological products, including enzymes and pathways, for production of chemicals, additives, and therapeutics. Enzymes are used in household materials (detergents and cleaners) and in chemical processes (cheese production, and bioremediation of waste). Pathways can produce bioplastics from sugar by engineered gut bacteria, or artemisinin (an antimalarial) from sugar by yeast. These biological products are engineered in cells. Cellular engineering, however, requires extensive scientific expertise, financial and material resources, and time. This project will design an engineering platform that eliminates production in cells. The goal is to simplify engineering and decrease costs 20-100 fold, and decrease time 2-5 fold. This results in a faster time-to-market for novel biological products and additional information to inform the engineering process. This STTR Phase II project proposes to utilize cell-free systems to speed up enzyme and pathway (metabolic) engineering. Cell-free systems can catalyze reactions without cellular complexity and without the need to maintain cellular growth. The goal of the project is to continue to develop a platform that can take as input user enzyme and pathway engineering questions and produce as output assay data. The primary focus is on developing computational methods for identification and optimization of enzymes and pathways for testing, molecular biological methods for assembling DNA, microfluidic methods for ultra-high-throughput analysis of cell-free expressions (10e7 samples), and analytical methods for detection. A secondary focus is the demonstration of this platform through cytochrome P450 engineering. Success with the primary focus demonstrates feasibility of replacing cellular engineering with faster and higher-throughput cell-free engineering processes. Success with the secondary focus produces directly-relevant enzymes for metabolic engineering pathways utilizing cytochrome P450s (e.g., natural products, bio-catalysis). This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "abstract": "Laser plasma accelerators (LPA) enabled by the Tm laser driver to be developed by this project offer much reduced size and cost compared to conventional accelerators of the same energy. This would drastically cut the cost of highenergy particle research on collider-based facilities and advanced light sources. Planned conventional accelerators (e.g., for the proposed International Linear Collider) would be 25 miles long. LPA hold the promise of making possible a low-cost table-top accelerator with particle energies in the tens of GeV range such. The proposed 2-micron Tm laser technology offers to advance LPA of nuclear particles, thus replacing the traditional mammoth-size and costly accelerator research facilities with room-size systems. The advantages of 2-micron lasers over their more developed 0.8-micron and 1-micron counterparts is in 4 to times improved particle trapping by ponderomotive force, thus enhancing the acceleration process. Compactness and relative simplicity of laser accelerators promises to greatly reduce the cost and timelines of high-energy research, and to advance new scientific discoveries. With energetic particle affordable for universities, commercial laboratories (e.g., semiconductor material development), and hospitals, the US would be able to maintain its technological leadership. The proposed project will leverage the ultrafast laser technology known as edge pumped disk laser (EPDL), which Aqwest previously developed for the US Army, thus benefiting from previous US government investment. In Phase I, we conducted engineering design, proof-of-concept analysis, and fabricated a novel Tm-doped laser ceramic. In Phase II, we will fabricate and test laser gain elements, and construct and test a Stage 1 of a 2-stage multipass amplifier for the driver laser. An eye-safe 2 \u03bcm Tm-based EPDL (especially pulsed) also has major commercial applications ranging from laser material processing (especially cutting and welding plastics) to remote sensing, biological tissue surgery in vivo, remote sensing, lidar, infra-red countermeasures, and optical communication. In laser material processing, a 2- micron EPDL offers to supplant the 1-micron (non-eye-safe) thin disk and fiber lasers which have been the dominant technology for lasers in the kilowatt range for the last 10 years."

        "abstract": "The future of high energy particle physics and X-ray light sources for biological and material research require miniaturized linear accelerators that at present cannot be qualified using existing methods. Such miniaturized linear accelerates, operated in THz and mm-wave bands, will be instrumental in managing the cost of future accelerator facilities. One technological issue at these wavelengths is difficulties in detecting RF breakdown phenomena, a critical capability to optimize the accelerator gradient. Another important deficiency is the absence of nanosecond-scale RF power modulators, required to drive these small structures without causing damage. In response to these problems, RadiaBeam Systems is developing three important devices: a high-resolution shot-to-shot spectrometer, based on the super-heterodyne, capable of detecting pulses with several nanosecond lengths, which is required to measure pulse widening due to RFDB in mm-wavelength structures; an optical laser-based switch capable to select 10 ns long pulses out of microseconds long pulses, thus enabling the use of gyrotrons as power supplies for sub-THz high gradient linear accelerators; and a broadband shot-to-shot spectrometer, based on a diffraction grating, to cover the wider THz frequency range, where an RF approach is not possible. In Phase II we have built prototypes of all three devices. The initial test results helped to demonstrate the proof-of-principle for shot-to-shot measurements of the spectra in THz and mm-wave frequency range, and detection of RFBD phenomena. At the same time, several issues were also identified as performance limiting factors, such as inability to select pulses with variable pulse length and rise times shorter than few nanoseconds, as well as to detect such pulses. In this Phase IIA we propose to continue the development of the spectrometer system by addressing these challenges. In particular, it is planned to develop an optical switch that can produce the adjustable width pulses from 1 to 10 ns, with a rise time less than the structure filling time to allow broader diagnostic capabilities and power multiplication. The system will include a spectrometer for pulse diagnostics and feedback, using ultra-fast Schottky detectors and a photonic quantizer-based analog to digital converter for fast signal digitization.Commercial Applications and Other Benefits\nThe proposed spectrometer will allow advancement of miniaturized terahertz linacs, allowing miniaturization of many future DOE accelerator facilities. In addition to the applications in short wavelength accelerating systems, the developed devices will also find multiple potential applications in the much broader field of THz technology and diagnostics, as well as in W-band power multipliers for military and telecommunication applications."

        "abstract": "Improved NDT (non-destructive testing) techniques are needed for inspection of concrete structures in nuclear power plants. Steel reinforcements embedded within concrete can corrode and crack, leading to weakening of the structures, and existing NDT techniques do not provide the full picture. Condition assessment is critical in evaluating these structures in order to ensure safe, long-term operation of the plants. The objective of this research effort is to develop and analyze a novel electromagnetic method for the inspection of buried conductive material. This method is based on the eddy current technique but uses magnetic sensors to measure the low frequency electromagnetic field response of the material and flaws. This system will be able to quickly make a qualitative record of the presence and condition of the embedded metallic material. RMD has developed a unique coil-driven, magnetoresistive sensor based probe that can sense the presence of rebar at greater than six inches below the surface. This system has been modeled and optimized to improve the positioning and response of the sensors, and extensive testing has begun using a flexible, arbitrary surface scanner. The probe is capable of detecting breaks and material loss on buried steel in concrete. Our Phase IIA will expand on our Phase II research with several major efforts. We will improve the performance of the sensor and apply new techniques to extend the detection capability of the probe, utilizing the experience we have gained in Phase I and II. We will develop the needed algorithms and software for operating and interpreting the data in a user friendly fashion. Finally we will advance the design to a point where a fully embedded, more capable field deployable prototype that is representative of a commercially viable device can be built and tested. Other activities would include investigating new issues that have come up in Phase II, such as the difficulty in inspecting multiple layers of metal and interference from surrounding magnetic structures. Our technology will reduce the cost and time required for inspection at nuclear power plants by providing more reliable results and decreasing costly downtime for in-service inspections. Finally, our technology could provide an important new source of critical information to advance the science of remaining life prediction and predictive maintenance for concrete structures. In addition to safer nuclear power, the public will benefit from new NDT technology for safer roads, bridges, buildings and other concrete structures."

        "abstract": "Substantially improve fuel efficiency and emissions in automotive gasoline engines by providing an innovation that will enable these advances by engine and vehicle manufacturers. A 5%netimprovement in fuel economy would imply savings of about 7 billion gallons of gasoline per year. Precision Combustion, Inc. has innovated a unique new onboard hydrogen generator that could be used in new vehicles and retrofitted to existing engines to enable more efficient and clean engine operation supporting key combustion improvement strategies being pursued by the Vehicle Technologies Office. An ultra-compact and high efficiency gasoline reforming reactor was developed, and integrated into and tested with multiple engines. Testing confirmed Net Fuel Consumption improvement, stable engine operation at extended lean limit for further fuel economy gains, component durability, and significantly reduced emissions of oxides of nitrogen, hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide. Precision Combustion, Inc. will transition the technology to OEM use by provide prototypes and supporting OEM internal testing and trial of the new component, as well as mature and enhance the component design and develop supporting materials for commercialization. The project will produce a commercial device that will support engine OEM new product development objectives and lead to adoption by engine OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: The proposed effort will result in the development of a practical, cost-effective and efficient system that could be readily integrated into modern engines for improved efficiency gasoline combustion, helping to enable achievement of very high mpg targets. Success in introducing the system into commercial automotive engines would provide a strong market entry that competitive forces will spread throughthe industry. Parallel non-SBIR funding from a Tier 1 supplier and others to expand on the Phase IIB effort highlights interest, reduces implementation risk and provides credibility of the approach."

        "abstract": "The Department of Energy (DOE) has pursued multiple strategies for making vehicles lighter and more fuel efficient. Past efforts have focused on either developing technologies to replace heavy steel components or using high-strength steels to reduce the amount of steel needed for the same load-bearing capacity. However, these techniques have proved problematic because the former requires expensive exotic materials and expensive factory retooling for manufacturers, while the latter involves using high strength steels that require expensive alloying elements or are brittle and unsuitable for automotive applications. SFP Works has developed a novel heat treating process to create low-cost, very high-strength Flash Processed steel from commercial off- the-shelf plain carbon steels. The technology uses a rapid thermal cycle to create a formable and weldable steel that is well suited for the automotive industry. In the Phase I and Phase II, SFP Works developed three grades of high strength Flash Processed Steels from plain carbon steels. In addition, it fabricated numerous automotive parts through traditional cold (room temperature) stamping operations. A prototype fuel shield was fabricated from Flash 1500 (1500 MPa Ultimate Tensile Strength) that was 33% lighter than the current production part, and passed safety testing conducted by General Motors engineers. Understanding tool wear when trimming and stamping Flash Processed steels is the last significant R&amp;D barrier to commercializing Flash processing technology. In Phase IIB, SFP Works will determine if parts made from Flash 1100 and Flash 1500 steels can be economically die trimmed and whether the tooling surface can be fabricated so that they do not excessively wear over hundreds of thousands of stampings. SFP Works proposed to fabricate a progressive die trimming and stamping tool from hard steels commonly used in production tooling and produce 25,000 copies of a representative part to determine wear on the tool\u2019s trimming and stamping surfaces. Commercial Applications and Other Benefit: Flash Processed steel will provide Americans with lighter, more fuel efficient vehicles that also perform as well, or better, in all passenger protection safety tests. Additionally, Flash Processed steels could allow for cranes with longer boom lengths and increased lifting capacity, and farm machinery, military equipment, line pipe, and pressure vessels that are lighter and easier to transport yet just as durable."

This ionomer dispersion technology has been successfully combined with DSM technology to create more durable MEAs. In the Phase II B project, we will further develop this technology in more processable, scalable and profitable ways. We will use a roll-to-roll process to make full-sized MEAs that combine nonaqueous ionomer dispersion and DSMs. We will evaluate these MEAs in more extensive and practical conditions and explore their potential markets.Commercial Applications and Other Benefits\nThe successful completion of this project will improve the durability and performance of PEM fuel cells and electrolyzers, significantly reducing the cost of fuel cell vehicles.

        "abstract": "241Am-Be(\u03b1,n) radiochemical neutron sources are used for geophysical well logging serving groundwater, mining, geotechnical, environmental and research users\u2014as well as the major Oil\/Gas industries. There is an urgent need to prevent intentional or accidental diversion and\/or use as a radiological dispersal device. It is difficult to track\/safeguard these materials with ~9,000 active sources for domestic oil\/gas and ~4,500 sources for non-oil\/gas geophysical sectors. The primary obstacle cited for 241Am-Be replacement is a change to the source effects the neutron emission spectrum and properties\u2014requiring recalibration, tooling redesign and data reinterpretation. Phase II research has shown that the 2.5MeV D-D neutron energy exhibits excellent sensitivity to formation porosity and tooling re-design that takes advantage of the end-generated neutrons can effectively replicate the Near\/Far formation response for compensated neutron logging (CNL) in limestone, dolomite and sandstone with suitable counting statistics. Neutron emission is at the generator end allowing unrestricted placement of near and far detectors to tailor the geophysical formation response.Starfire has partnered with Mt. Sopris Instruments to integrate our downhole neutron generator with an optimized set of near and far detectors to yield a compensated neutron logging tool that will mimic the Am-Be formation response. This is possible because neutrons in the 1-4MeV energy range are most responsible for the actual porosity measurement from the Am-Be reaction and the 2.5MeV D-D fusion emission is right in the sweet spot for optimization. Adjusting the near\/far detector spacing, volume, pressurization, moderation and shielding results in an electronic CNL tool that is free from radiochemical sources with Phase IIB funding. The tool can be extended to PGNAA and meet an urgent need for the underserved non-oil\/gas market.Commercial Applications and Other BenefitsThe technology has immediate application for radiochemical replacement in the underserved non-oil\/gas geophysical water, mining and environmental well logging. Many customers cannot use Am-Be sources due to regulatory restrictions and threat of contamination. The Phase IIB technology would alleviate this gap and pain point for end uses. Partnering with Mt. Sopris for integration with industry-standard QL40 small-bore tooling and WellCAD software will be a boon for a wide customer base."

        "abstract": "Modern fuel cells have been in development since the 1960s and stand on the cusp of commercialization, but are held back by high manufacturing costs and expensive catalysts. Membrane costs alone can account for as much as 45% of the total cost of a commercial fuel cell system. Furthermore, manufacturing defects in the membrane can cascade into complete stack failure, which is expensive and time consuming to resolve. These defects are often not discovered until costly catalyst has been irreversibly applied and the MEA is fully assembled, leading to additional wasted materials and a slow correction of the coating process. To achieve large scale commercialization, fuel cell manufacturing needs a high-efficiency, real-time quality control system that can provide 100% inspection of the membrane at coating speeds up to 60 ft\/min. Mainstream\u2019s approach uses near-UV\/Vis light to infer membrane film thickness, composition, and defects with a single detector, light source, and pair of cross-polarizers. Mainstream\u2019s Cross-Polarized Near-UV\/Vis (CPNUVV) system simultaneously measures membrane thickness and determines and quantifies membrane defects in real-time at roll-to-roll coating speeds. This information can be relayed to a printer to mark defective membranes, allowing exclusion from catalyst coating as well as rapid feedback to correct the membrane coating process. During Phase II, Mainstream successfully developed the CPNUVV low-cost optical detector for continuous analysis of membranes for PEM fuel cells. The inspection technique samples the entire web in real-time so defects in MEA materials can be removed prior to assembly into fuel cell stacks and automotive systems. In the sequential Phase IIB program, Mainstream will finalize a suite of instruments that provide a full turnkey inspection package for membrane production to commercialize the CPNUVV technology developed in Phase II.Commercial Applications and Other BenefitsThe CPNUVV Detector will help drive down costs and increase reliability of fuel cell membranes which are often still too expensive to compete with conventional power technologies. The early detection of defective membranes allows their removal before further coating or assembly steps, reducing costs by minimizing wasteful use of expensive platinum catalyst, labor used to construct stack materials, and defective returns from the customer. The CPNUVV Detector is not limited to fuel cell membranes and other membrane processes can benefit from improved quality control devices."

        "abstract": "Dry cask storage systems (DCSS) are used to store spent nuclear fuel from nuclear power plants. Without a long term storage solution in place, storage for decades in casks may be required. High burnup fuel rods may become brittle over time presenting problems for eventual transport of the spent fuel from reactor sites to a central storage facility. It is desired to passively determine the structural integrity of spent fuel assemblies by monitoring conditions inside the casks including temperatures, pressures, corrosion products and radioactive decay elements. The presence of Kr-85, a high yield, long-life fission product gas, in the outer envelope of a dry storage cask is an indicator of a fuel rod cladding breach. RMD is developing radiation detectors for monitoring beta particle emissions from Kr-85 radiation while inside storage casks. In particular, the design goal is to detect beta particles in the presence of strong background gamma rays. Diamond is a wide band gap semiconductor that can operate at elevated temperatures and under high radiation conditions, and with intrinsic properties that enable high count rate detection. All of the Phase II technical objectives were successfully accomplished. These involved the fabrication of diamond detectors, fabrication and characterization of diamond spectrometers for detecting beta particle radiation in a gamma-ray background at high temperature up to 200oC, fabrication of stacked detectors an developing a coincidence detection technique for rejection of gamma rays signals, evaluated and compared various detector configurations and operating parameters, design of packaging and tungsten shielding suitable for use in a commercial casks, and the design of rad-hard, high temperature electronic circuitry. The Phase II research and development has demonstrated the approach and built a foundation for continuing to advance the technology towards commercialization. In Phase IIB, we will perform the engineering development to reach the pre-production prototype stage for integration into a commercial cask for testing and evaluation by Orano Inc., a commercial manufacturer of nuclear waste casks. This effort will include: Optimizing the detector configuration, operating parameters and shielding, building electronic circuitry based on the Phase II design, producing an integrated system with detector and front-end electronics compatible with the space limitations and internal structural components in a commercial cask, and testing in a realistic simulated environment. As with Phase II, the Phase IIB effort will be carried out in collaboration with Draper Laboratories (Cambridge, MA).Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:In addition to monitoring status of nuclear waste inside storage casks, non-destructive evaluation, particle physics and homeland security are also possible areas that would benefit from a rad hard beta particle detector, which could operate at elevated temperatures if need be. Bore hole logging is another high temperature detector application. Due to its high density of nuclei, diamond is promising for fast neutron detection. Diamond detectors are also well suited for tissue equivalent dosimeter applications."

        "abstract": "In order to increase the resiliency and to optimize the operating efficiency of transmission systems utilities must be able to quickly restore service after a failure. Locating faults with current technologies on underground transmission systems can be a time consuming and skilled labor intensive process often taking many days or even weeks. The proposed solution for these challenges will allow the operator to: Reduce time and skill level for fault location and repair of fluid-filled pipe-type cables; Reduce long duration outages in self-contained fluid-filled submarine cables. This DoE SBIR Phase IIB proposal would (1) demonstrate the system\u2019s accuracy utilizing an out of service High-Pressure Fluid-Filled HPFF pipe-type Cable system, (2) develop a novel pinpointing technology and (3) further expand the scope of the original DoE sponsored Phase II R&amp;D project to address Self-Contained Fluid-Filled SCFF submarine power cables. The fault location systems to be further developed are for underground laminar\/dielectric fluid insulated power cable types. For HPFF pipe-type cable systems, which represent more than 80% of underground transmission cables installed in the US, this work will improve the initial location of the fault and then pinpoint the location for the repair. In addition, USi will investigate and develop a high accuracy fault location system for SCFF submarine cables. Design of test protocols\/methods for fault location will be provided since actual fault event demonstrations on operating systems are not practical. Pilot installations in utility underground transmission systems are planned to demonstrate the new instrumentation\u2019s reliability. USi is a leader in advanced diagnostics for underground transmission systems with over 30 years of experience in the design, manufacture, field application and maintenance of monitoring, rating, diagnostic and control systems with installations both domestic and abroad.Successful implementation of the proposed systems has social, technical, and economic benefits to the U.S. The social benefit to the U.S. is the public\u2019s security and comfort knowing that the U.S. has a technologically advanced electric power transmission grid. The technical benefit is establishing next-generation fault locating devices delivering increased system resiliency. The economic benefit results from a more resilient grid through faster, less expensive fault location and repair of underground transmission systems. The availability of domestic advanced sensors and systems will also enhance the United States competitive position worldwide. We estimate that the repair time, including fault location, for bulk power transmission feeders will be reduced by about 35% and the repair cost savings will be augmented by the savings in replacement energy costs."

        "abstract": "The simulation of magnetically confined plasmas requires consideration of multiple overlapping scales. Continuum models address reactor scale behaviors, while particle methods capture fine scale behavior. The complex combination of physics and reactor geometry results in simulations involving massive calculations and data sets, which can only be executed on parallel computers. Thus, there is a critical need for effective methods that can execute coupled simulations with fully parallel representations, and computations, at both the continuum and particle level with specific consideration of the ability to perform validation with experimentally measured data. The goal of this project is to develop structures and tools for multiscale plasma simulations that provide a parallel mesh and particle infrastructure, geometry and meshing methods that can support fully detailed reactor geometries, methods for scalable coupled mesh and particle operations, and a user interface for specification of the fusion plasma simulation workflows. Phases II efforts have provided: A parallel mesh\/particle infrastructure for effective particle-in-cell simulations. Methods to couple simulation data to uncertainty quantification and optimization. Geometry construction and meshing tools for tokamak and stellarator systems. A graphical user interface for fusion simulations. The tools developed in the project have been integrated into multiple tools being used by several fusion research groups. The Phase IIB project will address new challenges related to the definition, coupling, and meshing of detailed geometries being considered by fusion researchers. Developments will focus on the automatic creation of appropriate analysis models from input data consisting of complex design geometries and physics geometries from other simulations. New meshing and mesh adaptivity capabilities will be developed which are appropriate for simulations of both tokamak and stellarator systems. All of the developments will be actively coordinated with ongoing research into the simulation of fusion systems.Commercial Applications and Other Benefits\nThe combined mesh plus particle methods to be developed will provide a set components that can support the new generations of multiscale\/multiphysics simulations needed in the modeling of fusion and fission reactors, and for application in nuclear medicine. The analysis geometry construction\/clean-up and meshing methods being developed in this project are needed for the effective application of the high fidelity simulations needed to advance a wide variety of applications.

        "abstract": "Gallium nitride substrates are the key material for achieving high-end, energy-efficient semiconductor devices such as light emitting diodes (LEDs), laser diodes, power transistors and RF transistors. Significant effort has been exerted to develop cost-effective near-equilibrium ammonothermal (NEAT) growth of bulk GaN crystals; however, due to extreme hardness and chemical stability, a low-cost wafering process for bulk GaN crystals has not been fully established yet. During this DOE SBIR Phase I and Phase II project, SixPoint has met milestones to achieve a low-cost wafering process with incorporation of a novel grinding process called E-Grinding. We have achieved atomically smooth 2&quot; GaN substrates with minimum amount of residual subsurface damage. In addition, incorporation of E-Grinding led to a 45% reduction of total processing time. The developed wafering process provided a high-quality GaN surface suitable for successive device fabrication. Through the ARPA-E SWITCHES program, we have demonstrated 1200 V p-n diodes fabricated on NEAT GaN substrates. However, while commercializing the NEAT GaN substrates, we have recognized three remaining problems which are impeding wide customer acceptance. In this Phase IIB project, we will solve 1) crystal lattice and physical bowing of GaN substrates, 2) large variation of miscut angle, and 3) residual nano-scale particle contaminants on the surface. Through reduction of oxygen concentration in NEAT GaN growth, we will reduce lattice mismatch which causes crystal lattice bowing. In addition, we will examine mechanical stress at each step in the wafering process to minimize the physical bow. To control miscut angle accurately, we will improve both the slicing and grinding processes through development of new adjustable stages. A new method for cleaning CMP-ed GaN surfaces will be established through surface analysis of GaN with residual particles. Chemical etching as well as physical removal methods will be employed to achieve particle-free GaN surfaces. The successful development of low-cost, low-defect 2&quot; epi-ready GaN substrates will increase customer acceptance of SixPoint\u2019s GaN substrates and consquently accelerate development of various in-demand GaN-based devices for making society more energy-efficient and IoT-connected."

        "abstract": "Algal biofuels hold the promise of directly replacing fossil fuels through domestic production of renewable gasoline, diesel fuel and jet fuel. Before algae can be converted to fuel it must be harvested and concentrated 400-fold, however, no commercial technology can perform this step cheaply enough to allow economic production of fuel from algae. The lack of a low cost algal harvesting technology is a critical roadblock preventing the commercial development of algal biofuels. This problem is being addressed through development of Manta Biofuel\u2019s low cost magnetic algae harvesting technology. In Phase I and II we developed a successful harvesting process which works reliably in the field at scale. The Phase IIB project is focused on removing barriers to commercializing this technology. This project is primarily focused on cutting cost and removing a binding inhibitor as commercialization barriers. The harvester will significantly exceeded the DOE\u2019s target performance metrics by the end of the Phase II project. Our Phase IIB project will target a final capital cost reduction of 96%. The Phase IIB project will cut cost by implementing simple design refinements and utilizing design for manufacturing engineering. Design for manufacturing will transition the equipment from prototype to product, and prepare the system for mass manufacturing. The resulting equipment\u2019s will be tested in the field with actual feedstock to ensure the system works well in its designed production environment. The harvester will be used commercially in Manta Biofuel\u2019s cost competitive renewable crude oil production system, ensuring that this project fulfills the SBIR program\u2019s mission of commercializing federally supported R&amp;D. Successful development through Phase IIB will result in a commercially viable algae harvester that can be mass manufactured at sufficiently low cost to allow economic harvest of algae for fuel. Enabling production of renewable algal biofuel at scale will have significant public benefits. Development of renewable fuels will reduce greenhouse gas emissions that lead to global warming. It will drive the creation of sustainable jobs in rural America where biofuel production will take place. Domestically produced fuel will reduce dependence on foreign oil and help decouple US foreign policy from US energy needs. Deriving our fuel from a sustainable source will provide economic security through predictable production and prices as opposed to the boom-and-bust cycles that dominate fuel markets today."

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase II Project aims to tackle the two greatest barriers to technology adoption associated with metal additive manufacturing (AM) - cost and quantities. Current metal AM platforms use expensive core components and consumable materials in high-priced machines that produce 99.9% dense parts. The proposed project calls into question the performance requirements that most American manufacturers have for industrial grade stainless steel parts. While these manufacturers require high performance, they cannot currently afford to take advantage of AM benefits due to the high capital expenditure, maintenance, and operating costs associated with current commercial technologies. This proposal re-examines the material performance, machine cost and reliability requirements necessary for a novel metal AM system to satisfy most American manufacturers&apos; needs. In developing a low-cost AM alternative, the goal of the proposal is to allow an estimated over 50,000 American manufacturers to capitalize on the benefits of AM and simultaneously compete in an ultra-competitive, highly globalized manufacturing industry. In addition, procurement for low to medium volume order quantities (1000 - 20,000 pieces) is incredibly challenging with respect to high cost and long lead times. The proposed invention of a low-cost machine allows for never seen scalability in metal AM, allowing for smaller manufacturers to scale by taking advantage of meaningful order quantities and compete with the resources of large conglomerates. This research has broad implications in many industries and could be fundamentally enabling for the growth and prosperity of American manufacturing. The proposed project re-examines the need for high technology, high cost core components in currently available commercial metallic AM machines. Through an innovative deconstruction of the inkjet print head-based, binder jetting process, a method for producing metal end-use parts has been created. The 3DEO process is based on a novel combination of two low-tech and low cost, established technologies. The creation of a robust prototype with this novel method is a highly challenging, multi-faceted project involving key advances in materials science trough the development of a novel binder system compatible with the new process as well as a fundamental evaluation and improvement of material properties of the as-built parts. In addition, completely re-designed sintering cycles and a lengthy evaluation of shrinkage characteristics will be core challenges to overcome to achieve the tight tolerances manufacturing partners require. As such, these challenges will require tight cross-disciplinary collaboration for a meaningful outcome. The goal of the proposed research is to fabricate powder metallurgy parts of adequate structural integrity to satisfy industrial end-use requirements. This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase II effort will create transformative open tools to enable affordable access at scale to high quality assessments (problems &amp; questions) for foundational subjects in secondary and post-secondary education. The explosion of online student audiences, rapid growth of Open Educational Resources (OER), and the need to support individual learners are creating an unprecedented demand for digital assessments. Assessment authoring tools today are controlled by large organizations, require advanced skills and proprietary assessment delivery platforms with restrictive collaboration features. This inequity is particularly pronounced with respect to technology-enabled assessments (TEAs) which are sophisticated, digital assessments that enable deeper learning. This effort will democratize the process of authoring and sharing TEAs through the creation of intuitive end user tools that will enable educators without advanced technical skills to author and share TEAs. This has the potential to disrupt the status quo by empowering educators to take charge of the assessment creation and distribution landscape with ground-breaking tools that enable easy authoring and distribution of sophisticated TEAs without being restricted by a proprietary assessment system. Eventually, this will empower educators at scale by triggering the evolution of a peer-to-peer marketplace around the need for assessments, and impact hundreds of thousands of learners in secondary and tertiary education settings. This project will follow through on two principal innovations. The first is an end-user tool that will dramatically reduce the time and expertise required to author technology-enhanced assessments. The tool will facilitate intuitive authoring of TEAs by using symbolic representation of programming constructs. The second innovation is a new standard for representation of technology-enhanced assessments that makes them usable in any delivery platform, thus making the assessments platform-neutral. This effort will also advance the frontiers of authoring beyond individual assessments to the creation of adaptive assessment pathways that will provide personalization for diverse learners. It will explore novel technologies including the representation of TEAs as intelligent and portable objects that are interoperable with disparate assessment platforms through application programming interfaces. The research studies will provide insight into how the proposed innovations can make authoring of TEAs more efficient while lowering the skills barrier for educators, and the degree to which such TEAs are effective in eliciting student reasoning and thinking processes in foundational subjects. This will be achieved through a combination of usability and validation studies in partnership with secondary and post-secondary educators drawn from different institutions. This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop a manufacturing platform for opioid medicines. Opioids enable physicians to provide compassionate care to patients suffering from acute or chronic disease and trauma. The need for opioid analgesics is even more salient for surgeons anticipating the post-operative recovery of their patients and planning for end-of-life care. However, opioids are highly addictive medicines, a property that has been exploited for commercial gain by certain players in the pharmaceutical industry. The impact of this project will be to deliver a technology that transforms the existing supply chain for opioids by removing the need to grow opium poppy as a drug crop. Instead of sourcing poppy materials from poppy-growing countries, this new technology will allow for complete production of opioids in a secure industrial facility located in the United States where federal agencies can provide oversight and regulation. Additionally, investment in this technology will enable the development of many more existing and experimental medicines derived from plants, including greatly improved opioids with improved efficacy and safety, and cardiovascular and chemotherapeutic therapies that will extend and enhance human lives. This SBIR Phase II project will develop a bioprocess for opioid active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). To date, the only commercially-competitive method for manufacturing opioids and related alkaloids is to extract these molecules from plants. However, Baker&apos;s yeast was recently engineered to biosynthesize opioids, which is a technological advance that could enable opioid production by fermentation. However, many technical hurdles remain in developing a reliable and cost-effective, commercially-viable production system based on existing strains. The objective of this Phase II project is to provide a complete demonstration and pilot-scale operation of an API bioprocess that is ready for industrial scale up. The research employs four approaches: 1) Further development of the engineered yeast strains, 2) scale up of fermentation from laboratory scale to pilot scale, 3) optimization of downstream recovery and purification, and 4) evaluation of the resulting products to establish their validity as drop-in-replacements for existing opioid APIs. The outcome will be a process validated at pilot scale and ready for technology transfer to a secure industrial facility that will make and sell into the opioids API market. This research will replace opium poppies with a modern bioprocess that resembles established, standardized pharmaceutical industry methods for antibiotic and biologic APIs.

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this project will be in promoting clean energy technologies. More than half of the United States? greenhouse gas emissions come from transportation and electricity production. Lithium-ion batteries are a promising technology to facilitate the adoption of electric vehicles and renewable power generation that drastically reduce greenhouse gas emission. However, the high cost of lithium-ion batteries threatens the commercial viability of clean technologies. This Phase II project will develop manufacturing process technologies that reduce the capital and operating costs of the most expensive step in lithium-ion battery manufacturing. Low-cost batteries will push electric vehicles towards widespread commercial adoption. Electrification of mass-transit buses will improve urban air quality, especially for the low-income population located near bus depots. Large-scale battery systems enabled by low-cost batteries will turn renewable power generation such as solar and wind from periodic energy sources into on-demand energy sources to alleviate our dependence on fossil-fuels. This Phase II project will help lithium-ion batteries become a key technology in the successful departure from oil dependence, combat of climate change, and the United States? energy security. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project addresses the need for deeper understanding of the fundamental science behind the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer. SEI layer quality is a key determinant of long-term battery reliability, performance, and safety, but the underlying electrochemistry that governs SEI composition and evolution remains poorly understood. This Phase II project will develop novel, in-situ diagnostics to directly measure the evolution, performance, and characteristics of the SEI layer as it is formed during lithium-ion battery manufacturing. Deeper insight into the complex morphology of the SEI layer will advance much-needed industry knowledge of battery performance, quality, and longevity. Additionally, there is a sizeable body of work in modeling the degradation of batteries throughout their lifecycle. With improved cell-level traceability, the manufacturing insights enabled by this Phase II project will expand the current understanding of the ?ideal battery? at the beginning of life and complement ongoing work on how batteries degrade over time. This insight opens the door for quality control in battery manufacturing based on more direct quality metrics such as longevity and reliability rather than indirect metrics such as beginning of life capacity."

QC technology is expected to disrupt significant portions of the high-performance computing environment for optimization problems, which has previously been characterized by slow and incremental performance improvements. This project would yield a platform that both increases the efficiency and lowers the cost of analyzing complex optimization problems, which could spur fast-paced innovation in wide areas of the economy that tackle such issues. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the need for a cloud-based platform for using QC technology. Early-generation quantum computers have been introduced by multiple hardware vendors. Despite advances in performance of QC processors, little effort has been directed toward developing programming environments and applications that can provide simple and inexpensive access to QC capabilities and that can exploit the power that QC systems will have in the near future. This project will develop a suite of front-end and back-end tools that efficiently transform high-level computing problems into formulations for circuit-model QC systems, abstracting away the physical low-level details and domain knowledge currently necessary to build QC applications. The project will further develop a set of applications in optimization, search, and machine learning. The proposed research will explore the best software tools and platform methods for integrating emerging QC capabilities into enterprise and research workflows by streamlining and making affordable the decomposition and formulation of real-world problems into implementations that run on quantum processors.

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is a video-based safety system for improving the quality and reducing the cost of dementia care. Alzheimer&apos;s Disease (AD) affects 5.4M in the US, including 1 in 9 over 65 and 1 in 3 over 85, and represents two thirds of all those affected by dementia. It is the single most expensive disease in the US ($236B direct; $221B indirect costs). The size of the US population with AD doubles every 15 years. The drug failure rate for AD is among the highest, currently 99.6. Fall accidents account for 26% of all AD related hospitalizations and are a major concern and key cost contributor, with an average fall rate of 4 falls per year and 3 in 4 repeated falls. Unfortunately, safety products developed for falls were developed for cognitively aware adults and not designed specifically for individuals with AD. The proposed system will change the quality of care and operations in memory care facilities, increase quality of life for patients and families, and help the medical profession gain a better understanding of dementia. The proposed project addresses this critical gap in Alzheimer&apos;s care by detecting safety critical events, based on camera video where events can be reviewed by a human assistant in real-time and after the fact. It is expected to achieve two main objectives that advance science and technology: (1) Demonstrating the ability for our machine learning algorithms to automatically perform safety critical tasks, by learning over a sufficiently rich set of data. These extend existing methods for fall detection to include (a) fall prediction; (b) wandering detection; (c) bed sores detections; (2) enabling the Company to demonstrate that the system proposed can run with a fully operational HIL paradigm running at scale with up to 1000 patients in 100 memory care facilities. This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of this project is to develop high performance materials for light activated 3D printers. If successful, this will enable new tools for manufacturing and research. Applications of this project would enable affordable, waste-free, and energy-efficient manufacturing with the goal of lowering barriers to innovation. Specifically, this project has the potential to improve the quality of healthcare around the world, by dramatically lowering the costs of designing and manufacturing biomedical devices. polySpectra has developed a new class of modular 3D printing resins, capable of manufacturing production-quality parts with tailored geometry and chemical functionality in a single step. This process is called ?functional lithography,? and it unlocks the ability to simultaneously define the form and function of advanced materials. The application of functional lithography to additive manufacturing enables production-ready parts to be directly 3D-printed, whereas existing materials can only make prototypes, mock-ups or toys. The goal of this project is to develop new advanced manufacturing processes using functional lithography, towards direct additive manufacturing of high-fidelity polymer components, devices and hardware."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to allow more consumers to make use of assisted and autonomous driving systems in automobiles. Fully Autonomous Vehicles (AV) will reduce traffic collisions and enable humans to spend less time driving and more time on productive activities. Commercially deploying AVs requires a number of key technologies including sensing, perceptual systems, motion planning, and actuation. Our discussions with leaders and decisionmakers at automotive companies have shown that the development of robust, accurate, and energy-efficient perception systems is a major technical obstacle to creating mass-producible autonomous road vehicles. Of particular interest to automakers is scaling down the computational requirements of perceptual systems while preserving high levels of accuracy and robustness. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will use deep learning to create perception systems that are (a) scalable across different computational platforms and (b) scalable across smaller or larger sensor sets. Specifically, the company will develop scalable systems from small compute platforms (used for Highly Automated Driving) to somewhat larger compute platforms (used for Fully Automated Driving). Further, the company will develop perceptual systems that scale from few sensors to many sensors. The goal is to &quot;do more with less,&quot; advancing the pareto-optimal frontier of efficiency-accuracy and price-accuracy tradeoffs. The company has already engaged with automotive OEMs and suppliers to develop partnerships and to define metrics for success in this endeavor. This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this project will be that this research will address the resolution and detection range requirements of autonomous driving in complex environments such as urban scenarios. The next major revolution of transportation is undoubtedly autonomous driving, which will increase safety, mobility and productivity. Fully autonomous transportation may eliminate human error, the leading cause of traffic accidents, and could also lead to reduced traffic congestion, higher energy efficiency, and enhanced mobility for the aging and disabled population. The proposed advanced sensing system with intelligent algorithms is expected to help enable and advance the autonomous driving revolution. The proposed effort will also have great commercial impact. The global market size of autonomous sensors is expected to grow from $5.2 billion in 2018 to $11.9 billion in 2023, with the radar-based sensor segment representing $2.9 billion in 2023. In addition, the expected research outcome may lead to advancements in a number of important market sectors including wireless communications, sensing, mobile internet, assistive technology, and additive manufacturing. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project aims to realize a 3D-printed Luneburg lens-based high performance automotive radar for autonomous driving. Existing automotive radars do not have enough distance detection, field of view, and angular resolution for classifying and locating dense targets, which is critical for achieving fully autonomous driving. As a result, current autonomous driving tests utilize LiDAR ((Light Detection And Ranging) systems which are more expensive and less reliable than radar especially under adverse weather conditions such as rain, snow, fog, and smoke. Compared to conventional manufacturing techniques, this project utilizes 3D printing, which is convenient, fast, inexpensive and capable of implementing millimeter wave Luneburg lenses. Based on the Luneburg lens?s ability to form multiple beams with high gain and broad bandwidth, a novel automotive radar will be designed by mounting radar detectors around the lens. Moreover, with the wide bandwidth and natural beam forming capabilities of the Luneburg lens, an adaptive sensing approach is proposed to improve the scanning efficiency and avoid interference from nearby or intruder radar systems. With these proposed approaches, the objective is to achieve a high performance and high value millimeter-wave sensing system suitable for autonomous transportation applications.

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is developing a safe and sustainable ink for the global ink industry. Approximately nine billion pounds of ink is produced annually around the world. Currently, ink is predominantly made of petroleum or inorganic chemicals mined from the earth. For example, carbon black is commonly used in traditional ink, which is derived from petroleum, not biodegradable, and toxic for humans. To solve this problem, nature has produced a multitude of molecules capable of replacing pigments currently utilized in ink. While many organisms that produce these alternatives are slow growing and require energy sources like sugar, photosynthetic microbes, such as cyanobacteria, are capable of being engineered in an efficient manner to produce pigments in ink formulations that are safe, renewable, and 100% biodegradable. This ink will be used by businesses for printing packaging, marketing material, and other printed products. Developing and integrating these ink products will decrease significantly the overall detrimental impact of traditional inks on the environment, and more importantly, human health. This SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop sustainable ink formulations using cyanobacteria as feedstock for producing optically black pigments for printing inks. This project will also engineer cyanobacteria cells capable of generating cellular pigments for a color spectrum of cyan, magenta, and yellow. These colored cyanobacteria will act as pigments that replace mined pigments found in traditional ink formulations, such as carbon black and cadmium. This project is developing a unique process in which extraction of pigments\/dyes is not necessary, thus saving energy and reducing cost. Using cyanobacteria cells as pigments creates a renewable source of biomass for bio-products, as these organisms leverage sunlight, carbon dioxide, wastewater and land otherwise unsuitable for conventional agriculture to rapidly generate biomass. In addition to the development of colorful renewable cyanobacteria strains, this project will focus on manufacturing thousands of pounds of ink products for testing and consumer use as well as testing the applicability of these natural pigments to act as colorants in the food and textile industries.

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase II project seeks to develop an internet-of-things (IoT) data collection and analysis platform for collaborative STEM and big data research and education, that enables collaborative, geographically dispersed collection of data from internet enabled scientific instruments. STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) jobs are on the rise: the U.S. Department of Commerce predicts that occupations in these sectors will grow by 8.9 % from 2014 to 2024. Yet the U.S. currently faces a critical shortage of workers and students who are proficient in math and science subjects. In part, this shortage is due to a lack of interest in STEM-related fields by minorities and women. Engaging, relevant and hands on experiences are needed to encourage interest amongst these populations. This project fulfills the requests of the federal government and leading-edge STEM educators that both secondary and post-secondary institutions teach science in a way that engages students with real-world problems. The expectation is that this project will make big data accessible, while providing rewarding and appealing hands-on learning opportunities that will increase data literacy; increase scientific collaboration in education across geographic and interdisciplinary lines; and increase scientific literacy and interest across demographics, thus increasing the likelihood that students will continue to pursue scientific careers. The proposed technology will be the first collaborative educational IoT STEM platform to be developed, and is innovative in the field of Educational Technology, which has yet to adopt web-connected sensors that generate big data on a global scale. At present, there is no mechanism for schools to collect and share real data between classrooms and schools in an organized way. The proposed innovation allows users to communicate via a global network and is capable of being paired with an unlimited variety of scientific instruments and data sources, to support versatile, engaging, coordinated, multi-school experiments and data sharing. Data science now impacts virtually every profession in some way, and the platform will uniquely expose students to big data analytics in an engaging and relevant way. In Phase 1, feasibility of approach was firmly established. Phase II objectives will be to expand the educational platform developed in Phase I to optimize national\/global impact and support applicability to big data research as well as a range of sensors. Goals include to expand tools to view and analyze data, refine and expand curriculum, develop an Application Programming Interface and create software tools to manipulate and share data\/curriculum. The platform&apos;s ability to promote greater learning will also be evaluated.

        "abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is that if successful, the results of this project will revolutionize large area LED array assembly manufacturing, leading to unprecedented growth of the direct view LED display market. Direct view LED displays, or video walls, are becoming more ubiquitous in everyday life. First only appearing in sports stadiums, they have gradually started appearing in retail advertising, and now are starting to appear in cinemas and control rooms. These types of displays are much brighter, have better contrast ratios, faster refresh rates, and are more energy efficient than other competing display technologies. Despite these advantages, rate of adoption is very slow, limited by the cost and time required to make these displays. Current manufacturing tools are facing a bottleneck as display resolutions increase. A massively parallel assembly technology could drastically increase production speeds while reducing cost-of-goods. Additionally, the knowledge gained by the research into this self-assembly technology has the potential to unlock new opportunities in semiconductor packaging including lighting and concentrated solar. The proposed project seeks to speed-up the LED placement process by leveraging the parallel nature of directed self-assembly. Rather than placing individual LEDs into a grid-array as it is done today, this technology utilizes confining magnetic fields to quickly and simply arrange hundreds or thousands of LEDs into a neat and ordered grid-array. The objective is to achieve assembly speeds at least 5 times faster than conventional tools. The research will focus on the effects of LED size and geometry on accuracy, rate, and yield. Additionally,\u00a0\u00a0new magnetic field stages to enhance assembly precision will be developed. The key anticipated results are (1) a system that will be able to rapidly assemble thousands of LED die with the precision necessary for high-resolution displays and (2) a fully operational LED display panel constructed with this technology to demonstrate the manufacturing potential of this technology.

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase II project will create an industrial process for bonding ceramics to metals at the molecular level. Attempts thus far have not been successful in creating robust bonds due to incongruities of the materials being bonded. The objective of this project is to develop a sophisticated, computer controlled, automated bonding machine that will rapidly and safely impact-bond net-shaped ceramic carbides to tool steel in configurations that were previously not available. An automated bonding machine will allow for a cost-effective way to rapidly produce high quality near-net or net-shaped parts. It is expected that as this simple method is popularized, new opportunities for design configurations will be realized in multiple industries; as single parts can take advantage of the properties multiple material, such as the strength and wear resistance of ceramics, with the properties of another, such as the light weight properties of aluminum. Engineers may incorporate cheaper, lighter, stronger, and multipurpose material parts into new product designs. For instance, many new ceramic and metal bonded parts may be fabricated for the automotive, aerospace, chemical, defense, excavation, and nuclear industries. This project will ultimately result in the creation of U.S. manufacturing, sales, and engineering jobs as the mass production of ceramic and metal bonded parts become commercially available. The impact-bonding occurs within a bonding machine and uses a portable and very powerful cartridge technology recently developed by the PI, an expert in aluminum\/water reactions. The cartridges are initiated in an enclosed chamber with a low voltage, which causes the disassociation of water molecules and rapid oxidization of aluminum that generates very high-pressure hydrogen in a safe and controlled manner and without the use of high voltage, explosives or flammable gun propellants. Key technological subjects of this research include the impact-energy, generated hydrogen propulsion, and the post-bond impact-energy absorption. The goal is a manufacturing process that will produce dissimilar material composite parts with superior joint strength that will survive impact-fatigue-cycles in harsh environments such as mining, demolition, excavation, construction, oil gas drilling, and many more potential industries. Other mechanical methods of joining ceramics and metals, such as brazing and adhesives, have not sustained impact fatigue cycling. The superior products are wear resistant and will benefit several industries to include the cutting tool market, electrical and thermally insulated components, ballistic armor, and others. This project aims to produce pioneering publications on impact bonding ceramics and metals and will also further enhance the knowledge of high-velocity impact bonding systems. This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase II project will address the lack of high application temperature materials available for additive manufacturing. Additive manufacturing, often called 3D printing, provides increased design freedom and complex features such as part consolidation and conformal cooling channels. The performance and efficiency of gas turbines and other applications can be increased by combining design improvements enabled by additive manufacturing with a suitable high temperature material. Unfortunately, existing materials either do not have sufficient high temperature performance or are not compatible with high quality printing methods. This project will develop new nickel superalloy composite additive manufacturing materials for use with high temperature gas turbine components. Successful completion of this project will result in more efficient turbines to reduce energy costs, transportation costs, and carbon emissions. The manufacturing, power generation, and aerospace industries are expected to be impacted from this project. In addition, history has demonstrated that new materials and manufacturing technologies often lead to additional unexpected innovations. This project will help the country lead in the innovation of high performance materials technology to address the needs of the $86 billion gas turbine market and to grow advanced manufacturing jobs in the US. This project will utilize innovative reactive additive manufacturing materials technology to develop 3D printable advanced high temperature superalloys. During additive fabrication, high melting temperature product phases will be synthesized in-situ within a superalloy matrix to significantly improve high temperature performance and improve printability. This innovative reactive additive manufacturing technology has been shown to be applicable to a wide range of materials systems including nickel superalloys in an NSF Phase I project. Metal matrix composites produced using this technology have demonstrated greatly increased strength, wear resistance, and high temperature performance relative to comparable traditional alloys. In addition, this technology has demonstrated the ability to eliminate micro and macro cracking problems with alloys that had previously been considered unprintable. This project aims to further develop one or more high temperature superalloys compatible with laser powder bed fusion additive manufacturing for use in the hot sections of gas turbines. The scope of the project includes theoretical and experimental development and evaluation of novel material feedstocks, additive manufacturing processing conditions, and heat treatments. Evaluation of printed components will include measurement of density, hardness, standard and high temperature tensile properties, creep, and microstructure and phase analysis. Turbine components will be additively fabricated for pilot studies.

        "abstract": "Accurate simulation of nuclear power plant behavior is necessary for both engineering and training applications. An engineering grade simulator, used for design, safety analysis and operations, is characterized by high fidelity, computational power, lack of real-time capability, and user non-interactive environment. By contrast, a training grade simulator, used for operator training and education, is characterized by lower fidelity, less computational power, real- time capability, and user interactive environment (e.g. freeze, interrupt, restart, retrace, redirect and visual display capabilities). This project\u2019s objective is to take the most overall desirable characteristics of both nuclear power plant engineering and training grade simulators, while increasing their respective fidelities, to create a simulator with a more productive environment for engineering applications and facilitate commonality across engineering and training grade simulators. This will result in increased engineering productivity, economic improvements via enhanced designs and operations via margin utilization, and more realistic training and education. Given the limited time and budget associated with Phase 1, focus of work to be done under Phase 1 will be on improving fidelity of one component of the nuclear power plant simulator, that being the neutronics portion of the core simulator. This will be done by employing a higher fidelity core simulator than that of currently used simulators to \u201cinform\u201d such simulators so that their fidelity can be improved. The higher fidelity core simulator that will be employed is the Consortium for Advanced Simulation of Light Water Reactors VERA-CS code. This simulator employs transport theory (MOC and SPN), many energy groups, and fine spatial mesh, with many isotopes tracked. In-core thermal-hydraulic (T-H) solution employs a subchannel two-fluid, three-field methodology, and finite difference solution for fuel rod heat conduction. Currently employed simulators utilize the few-group nodal diffusion method with limited isotope tracking and coupled in-core T-H model most often employing a closed channel, homogenous equilibrium mixture, drift flux, or a six equation, two-fluid model (e.g. RELAP5-3D). For this project the NESTLE nodal simulator will be utilized. All these models utilize a coarse spatial mesh, so homogenization techniques are important to obtaining reasonable fidelity. For the radiation transport solution, this is today done by completing lattice physics calculations. Lattice physics outputs include homogenized nuclear data (nodal cross-sections, discontinuity factors and pin form factors) as functions of thermal-hydraulics conditions and history effects. Lattice calculations are two dimensional (radial plane) and assume zero current boundary condition, and spatially and time constant temperatures and densities; hence, core-wide spatial and history effects are not correctly captured, requiring various ad hoc corrections to be introduced at the core-wide solution level using information from lattice branch depletions. Ideally, one could utilize VERA-CS in place of currently employed simulators to overcome these limitations, since VERA-CS introduces none of them. Unfortunately, VERA-CS computer resource requirements and execution times currently do not make this practical, given the volume of engineering grade simulations and need for real-time capability for training grade simulations. Executing VERA-CS a limited number of times to \u201cinform\u201d a currently employed simulator presents a practical path forward. For neutronics this would be done by completing core depletion and instantaneous branch cases using VERA-CS, to provide information that would be used, along with 3-D one-node nodal solutions, to generate consistently (with respect to preserving nuclear interaction rates, leakage, and pin powers) collapsed (with respect to space, energy and methodology) nuclear data for each spatial node, thereby correctly capturing core-wide and history effects. Research, development and verification of this consistent collapse approach, using VERA-CS and NESTLE, would be completed during Phase 1 with a focus on steady-state conditions. Phase 2 would then further characterize the nuclear data to enable transient conditions simulations, extend the consistent collapse methodology to in-core thermal-hydraulics to better capture subchannel effects, incorporate the core simulator into the overall nuclear power plant simulator, and refine the interactive environment characteristic of training grade simulators to better support engineering applications."

However, ITO has a number of disadvantages: ITO is not a suitable TCE for next-generation, high-efficiency, flexible OLEDs, because of its inappropriate work function, difficulty in creating desired patterns, low stability, delaminantion due to fracturing on flexible substrates, high cost, and the need to process at high temperatures, which limits the high speed manufacture of integrated ITO substrates. Therefore, there is a critical need to develop low-cost TCE as an alternative to ITO for next-generation OLEDs. The US Department of Energy\u2019s (DOE) TCE 2020 cost-target is $20\/m2.

Breeding was used to obtain better crops and farm animals for centuries but breeding of algae is still in its infancy. This project aims to develop breeding methodology for diatoms. The project will analyze the life cycle of a commercial diatom strain. This will provide an understanding of its sexual reproduction and allow for the development of techniques to breed diatoms in a controlled manner similar to terrestrial crops. Traditional microscopy analysis and molecular biology approaches will be used to demonstrate that controlled diatom breeding is possible. The first goal is to obtain diatom strains with high lipid content, but this concept can be applied when optimizing a strain for any property of interest like tolerance to infection or high growth rate. Diatom breeding has a potential to be a game changer in algae-based biofuels and is one of the new technologies that will make algae biofuels affordable."

        "abstract": "Tall towers and foundations for modern offshore and land-based wind turbines are too large to transport over roads or rail due to their extremely large dimensions. Existing \u201cone-off\u201d on-site construction methods are too expensive, and are too slow for manufacturing foundations and towers in the large numbers needed, especially for offshore components manufactured in ports with limited lay-down space. Innovative on-site manufacturing technologies and processes are needed to increase the production rate and reduce the capital cost of very large foundations and towers for offshore and land-based wind plants. This project will develop and assess the feasibility of an innovative concrete additive manufacturing process for building a variety of offshore and land-based wind turbine tower and foundation configurations on-site. The advanced manufacturing method reduces the capital cost of an offshore substructure and tower compared to conventional methods by up to 80% using low-cost regionally sourced concrete without expensive formwork, and increases production speed up to 20 times using an automated production-line approach. The initial target application of the additive manufacturing process is a 160-m tall gravity-based foundation and concrete tower for an offshore 10-MW turbine installed in 40-m of water. The STTR Phase I scope of work entails the first-ever conceptual design and techno-economic assessment of an additively manufactured concrete offshore wind turbine foundation and tower. The team will (1) design a concrete printer that can be used for a variety of tower and foundation designs, (2) develop a conceptual design for an offshore gravity-based foundation and tower, (3) assess the feasibility and production speed of additively manufactured concrete foundations and towers, and (4) perform an initial assessment of an a tripod substructure concept. Phase I maximizes the impact of project funding by using a recently published, federally funded study as the framework with which to assess the proposed technology for an existing East Coast port, and by adapting concrete additive manufacturing technologies initially developed for manufacturing of buildings. A follow-on Phase II will leverage national laboratory facilities to manufacture and test a sub-scale component or assembly if awarded."

        "abstract": "Fossil Energy (FE)-based modular power systems are a growing market that can meet the demand of rural and isolated areas both domestically and abroad. Many of these systems, also known as Radically Engineered Modular System (REMS), provide power and\/or heat for farms, homes, and other industrial processes. The concept is to produce syngas (synthetic natural gas) from coal and readily available biomass that can be converted to energy in an integrated gasification combined cycle. The development of these REMS systems requires additional research for their control systems to ensure reliable, safe, and efficient operation. Feed-forward control systems are anticipated to optimize performance mapping that can handle the variations in the fuel feed and environmental conditions. To enable these control systems, real-time sensing technologies are needed that can survive the extreme temperatures, corrosion, and fouling involved. Luna will develop a single-mode sapphire sensor for distributed temperature and flow measurement to address the Department of Energy\u2019s goals for REMS development and many other energy applications. The ability to attain distributed temperature, distributed velocity profiles, and self-diagnosis of deposits\/fouling thickness with a single sensor in extreme temperatures up to 1700\u00b0C is unique among all research in the field. The first application will be to coal\/biomass gasification systems and gas turbines, where Luna\u2019s sensor can provide real- time data. During Phase I, Luna will prove the feasibility of the sensing technique up to 1300 \u00b0C, while Phase II will ruggedize the system and extend operation to 1700\u00b0C."

        "abstract": "As installations of solar photovoltaics continue to soar, addressing the integration challenges that arise from high penetrations of solar will be paramount to achieving the SunShot Initiative 2030 goals of $0.03\/kWh to $0.05\/kWh levelized cost of electricity (LCOE). Specific challenges related to system ramping and over-generation tend to degrade the value of PV, and solutions are needed to address these issues. Harnessing load flexibility can create \u201cvirtual storage,\u201d that can be intelligently dispatched to increase the utilization of solar energy by better aligning demand with solar supply and reducing peak system capacity needs. This project develops smart, automated contracts to orchestrate advanced operation of distributed energy resources and flexible loads through peer-to-peer energy transactions. In Phase I, a subset of smart contracts will be defined that represent meaningful peer-to-peer transactions. Contracts will be implemented via blockchain interface\/application for automated execution and recording. An intelligent control engine will be adapted to inform smart peer-to- peer contracts. Simulation case studies will provide preliminary data to assess the performance benefits anticipated from the peer-to-peer technology. It is anticipated that dispatching advanced load flexibility through peer-to-peer transactions will increase the economy and reliability of the electric grid while permitting greater utilization of solar energy resources. In addition, the implementation of peer-to-peer transactions on blockchain technology promotes distributed, transparent, secure, and automated accounting that can lower the cost of managing advanced distributed resources. The blockchain-enabled flexible load control platform should be widely applicable as a control retrofit to numerous existing buildings. Although the initial application will focus on enabling load flexibility for greater utilization of solar energy, it is anticipated that the platform will be extensible to other DERs and microgrid applications."

        "abstract": "The discovery of advanced materials and molecules is difficult and largely an experimental endeavor. Computers are used to simulate materials and molecules but rarely to design them. We aim to demonstrate that novel materials and molecules can be computationally \u201cevolved\u201d using Genetic Programming, and we will develop: (1) Atomically precise membranes that would separate molecules at a fraction of the energy used currently in the chemical separations industry ($11 billion\/year market); (2) Green catalysts that transform inexpensive starting materials into pure, valuable products; (3) New therapeutics that wrap around and disable any target protein; and (4) Robust, environmental sensors for any target small molecule. We have developed a new software development environment called \u201cCando\u201d that enables the development of software for designing materials and molecules, primarily based on a new macromolecular chemistry called \u201cMolecular Lego\u201d but is generally applicable to the design of all organic molecules. In phase I of the project, we will develop software for designing robust, atomically precise, single molecule thick membranes that display the ultimate in high selectivity and high flux for the separation of hydrocarbons, gasses, liquids and small molecules. The software will be used to design membranes for specific separations and then we will contract their synthesis. We will develop markets for these membranes in the $11 billion market for chemical separations. In the phase I, we will also develop software for designing small molecule therapeutics to run \u201cfree-energy perturbation\u201d (FEP) calculations. FEP calculations are heavily used in the pharmaceutical industry to assist in drug discovery. FEP calculations are extremely difficult for drug discovery chemists to carry out and we will develop a revolutionary new user interface and backend to achieve this. There is currently only one commercial provider for FEP simulation software and this software is a ~ $50 million\/year market. FEP simulation software represents a \u201ctarget of opportunity\u201d for the small business that we are starting (possibly named \u201cCandesign\u201d) and we already have interest from one major pharmaceutical company. In Phase II, and beyond, we will develop software within Cando for designing macromolecular catalysts and new therapeutics based on Molecular Lego technology. We will then transition into a Molecular Lego synthesis and design company that markets advanced functional materials and macromolecules that rival biological materials in efficiency and capability but are robust and engineer-able. The company that we are starting (potentially named \u201cCandesign\u201d) will become the leader in \u201cOrganic Bottom-up Nanotechnology\u201d."

        "abstract": "Electric vehicle manufacturers and the Department of Energy want safer, longer-lasting batteries that utilize new, low-cost materials that are compatible with current battery manufacturing infrastructure and industry standardization. Lithium-ion batteries dominate the current electric vehicle market. The applicant, LLC holds an exclusive license to patented materials that have favorable properties for use in these batteries. In addition, these materials can also improve batteries for portable tools and electronics, medical implants, military and aerospace applications. The applicant\u2019s founders are developing recently patented multiphasic composite materials\u2014composed of graphene monoxide, graphene, and transition metal oxides\u2014into marketable products for novel lithium-ion anodes. With these anodes, battery performance will surpass current lithium-ion batteries because the composite materials facilitate both lithium+ and electron transfer and actively store and release lithium+ during charge\/discharge cycles. The new materials are compatible with graphite and silicon-graphite, enabling development of novel, lighter, and safer anode materials that will charge faster and increase battery energy and power densities. We will use 2 approaches to constrain costs: (1) maintain compatibility with existing anode manufacturing infrastructure and (2) initially enter the market as an additive to improve silicon-graphite anode performance. As economies of scale reduce the cost, the applicant\u2019s materials will become a larger-volume fraction of active anode materials. The applicant envisions itself as a materials company that operates in the Chemical and Materials market of lithium-ion batteries. The specific market is advanced Anode Materials with application in electric, plug- in, and hybrid vehicles. Market research projects that the lithium-ion battery market will reach ~$46 B worldwide by 2022, and that its anode segment will reach $1.2 B by 2020 and then will outpace the cathode segment. The applicant\u2019s primary customers are companies that assemble active materials into battery cells and design high-voltage battery packs for automotive applications. Additives can be an entry point into the market while material production scales up and costs decrease. Similarly, establishing with a regional strategic partner that the anodes work well in power tools will enable the applicant to approach enterprise-scale companies that manufacture materials in-house to build on national relationships and explore licensing options. Improved anode materials will result in better batteries, which in turn will make electric vehicles more affordable and convenient to drive. In addition to the economic benefits (such as job creation) from the innovative electric vehicle industry, political and environmental benefits include decreased dependence on foreign oil and reduced air pollution."

        "abstract": "High-radiation environments such as the Large Hadron Collider, (LHC) need components which are rad hard to a level of hundreds of Mrad. In addition, because the LHC will receive a high luminosity (HL) upgrade, the data produced will need to be transmitted at the rate of 10\u2019s to 100\u2019s of Tbps. In addition, the solution needs to be low mass. This will be accomplished using an array-able rad hard transmitter which does not require TE cooling and which is more efficient per bit than VCSEL solutions, and runs at 100 Gbps\/channel. This is accomplished with rad hard driver circuitry, combined with a laser-EAM chip which is designed to be rad hard, high speed and temperature insensitive. Phase 1 will demonstrate the rad-hard high-speed laser-EAM chip at 100 Gbps irradiated at various doses. Phase 1 will also demonstrate the rad hardness of the the driver circuitry in a nanometer CMOS process (such as 28nm), which include the complete design of the circuit for a 40-56 Gbps driver using PAM4. Phase II will integrate an array of these laser-EAMs flip chipped onto an array of drivers and tested at speed, over temperature and with various radiation doses. Because of the current lack of availability of suitable processes the NRZ 100 Gbps driver circuit will likely wait until Phase III. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: Commercial applications for the technologies developed by this project are in every data center and every computer so that it could potentially become ubiquitous. Supercomputers are the most likely large scale initial application. Super computers suffer from several bottlenecks and technological limitations which these devices address. Latency is addressed by eventually driving this transmitter at 100 Gbps NRZ. Power consumption is addressed by using 40 % less power per bit compared to a VCSEL solution. Data rate is addressed by running at 100 Gbps or greater, and using arrays. The higher data rate with arrays addresses the fiber form factor. The fiber form factor can be further easily addressed using CWDM because this device can be designed to work at a variety of wavelengths so that up to 5 different wavelengths can share a single fiber ribbon. In substantial volume the costs can be low enough to be useful across all the proposed platforms."

        "abstract": "High performance supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO2) turbo-expanders\/power turbines will provide significant increases in efficiency and compactness, while reducing greenhouse gases and water usage. However, the needed operation in a 900\u00b0C environment is a challenge for this type of turbomachinery. While magnetic bearings have many advantages over foil bearings, including no wear during startups, low drag loss, higher load capacity, controllable and adaptive stiffness and damping, health monitoring, and fault tolerance, the typical magnetic bearing cannot survive at ultra-high temperatures. This Small Business Technology Transfer project will develop a permanent magnet based magnetic bearing system actively cooled to the 550\u00b0C maximum operating temperature limit of permanent magnets, while meeting the load, speed and high temperature requirements to advance the sCO2 and other types of Brayton power cycle systems. The proposed novel magnetic bearings combine permanent magnets for supplying the bias field and electromagnets for supplying the control field, both in ultra-high temperature conditions. The choice of material is the ultra-high temperature Sm-Co permanent magnets (US patent 6,451,132) due to their significantly better thermal stability compared to Nd-Fe-B material. The 6-pole homopolar design permits uninterrupted force delivery via a redundant control capability (US patent 7,429,811) even if 3 poles were to fail. Phase I will proceed with: (1) the development of optimized and air cooled ultra-high temperature permanent magnet assembly, (2) development of low cost ultra-high temperature shaft position sensors for the feedback control, (3) a small prototype of radial magnetic bearing, (4) the design of the test rig including 2 radial and 1 thrust permanent magnet assemblies, and (5) the detailed, high fidelity design of the magnet bearing system, auxiliary bearings and position sensors to be used in the Phase II test rig. Phase II will develop a low cost, low loss, ultra-high temperature permanent magnet bearing system with redundant, fail safe coil\/power amplifier\/sensor failure compensation. This project will significantly extend the operating environment capability for turbomachinery applications such as nuclear power, concentrated solar thermal, fossil fuel, geothermal, and shipboard propulsion. The further advancement of ultra-high temperature permanent magnet bearings will also strengthen the US position in permanent magnet technology, which is presently heavily dominated by China. The ultra-high temperature Sm-Co magnet material that will be utilized in the proposed work has been developed exclusively by the project proposer. Many actuators, motors, generators and other magnetic bearing applications will greatly benefit from the proposed work."

        "abstract": "This proposal is submitted in response to the SBIR\/STTR Office of Science related to Quantum Information Science (QIS) Supporting Technologies. There is the need for fabrication techniques for scalable 3D Superconducting Radio Frequency (SRF) Structures for Quantum Information Systems. In this proposal we will develop an additive manufacturing approach to developing superconducting 3D microwave resonators and quantum memories for QIS. Optimized superconducting 3D microwave resonators are needed for shielding Josephson junction qubits at low temperatures. The need is for the highest possible Q-factor to improve the coherence time for cavity-qubit systems, to minimize de-coherence. Here we propose to use 3-D printing of Nb metal to form the 3-D resonator. This approach offers the simultaneous advantages of quick prototyping, ease of change of resonator design, and scalability, both in terms of size and in terms of multiple unit arrays. The process may potentially offer the advantage of compatibility with other fabrication processes needed for Q-bit formation, and may point the way towards integrated fabrication of qubit and resonator system. We will explore resonators made using a powder bed fusion approach with both e-beam and laser melting alternatives available. Material quality, surface quality, and Q-factor will be explored for simple geometries in Phase I along with design of optimized resonator shapes. We will focus on Nb materials. A route which can directly form Nb based SRF microwave shielding cavities would be of direct benefit to QIS qubit shielding. This proposed work has potential to impact the development of practical quantum computing, in terms of improving the potential for scale-up of quantum computing circuits to practical level devices. The potential applications of quantum computers are vast, and difficult to project. However, they have strong potential to influence many aspects of computing for science, for security, and eventually for commercial purposes. Applications of quantum computing are likely to be either in the area of security or science. The first applications of quantum computing will almost certainly be scientific computation where simulations may be the first application, in the long run, quantum computing has the potential to change the face of computation relevant to vast parts of the economy."

        "abstract": "Due to their advantages, fiber lasers have become major platforms for high average and peak power ultrafast laser sources. Coherent beam combining of many mode- locked fiber lasers is a very promising route to achieving ultrafast laser sources with kW-level or higher average power required for DOE accelerator applications. Scalable, robust, low-cost, and low-noise carrier envelope phase (CEP) locking technology is crucial for coherent beam combining of large numbers of ultrafast fiber lasers. Current CEP locking systems are mainly based on f-to-2f interferometer in which a broad-band supercontinuum is generated with a highly nonlinear silica fiber and second harmonic generation is realized with a nonlinear crystal. However, these systems usually contain free-space optics which severely constrain the stability and reliability. Moreover, the size and cost of CEP locking systems will become significant when large numbers of fiber lasers need to be locked. These problems can be solved with our proposed all-fiber f-2f interferometer in which the mode-locked laser amplification is achieved with a centimeter-long highly doped fiber amplifier and the supercontinuum generation and second harmonic generation are realized with centimeter-long tellurite fibers. In this Phase I program, we will focus on developing highly nonlinear tellurite fibers for octave-spanning supercontinuum generation and second harmonic generation and demonstrating the feasibility of CEP locking technology in all-fiber format. All-fiber CEP locking technology applicable to large numbers of ultrafast fiber lasers will be developed in Phase II. Our proposed all-fiber CEP locking technology can also be used for nonlinear signal processing, optical communications, frequency metrology, optical sensing, and high-precision spectroscopy."

        "abstract": "The majority of hybrid electric vehicles and electric vehicles (HEV\/EV) products use interior permanent magnet (IPM) synchronous machines for traction purpose due to the efficiency and power density consideration. IPM machines use high energy density rare earth based magnet materials such as neodymium and dysprosium. Variable flux (VF) machines using abundant and cheaper soft magnets such as AlNiCo feature better efficiency at moderate and high speed than IPM machines. Though a number of works have been published to demonstrate the benefits using VF machines versus IPM machines for vehicle application in lab environment, the mathematical modeling, control strategies, and design methodology for VF machines, very little work can be found to prove the reliability of VF machines from a real-world vehicle application point of view. Despite all the advantages of VF machines mentioned above, several major reliability-related application issues need to be solved before VF machines can be adopted for high volume HEV\/EV production. In this Phase I STTR project, the potential technical and economic barriers and solutions to apply VF machines to the vehicle traction application will be investigated. Experimental methods will be used to understand the demagnetization and magnetization behavior of various grades of AlNiCo magnets under a wide range of operating temperature, how repeated demagnetization and magnetization process will affect reliability, how to implement online demagnetization and magnetization of the VF machine without interrupting the vehicle operation. A100-kW VF machine will be designed that uses multiple grades of AlNiCo magnets so both high power density and easy control of the demagnetization and magnetization of magnets can be achieved. Additionally, a silicon-carbide based power converter will be designed for the proposed VF machine. Finally, a cost analysis for a VF machine and drive system will be developed, a reliable supplier and manufacturer chain will be assembled to prepare for the 100-kW VF machine prototype construction in Phase II, and the proposed technology and research results will be disseminated to automotive OEMs."

        "abstract": "The structure of the electric utility business has long been a centralized model where an electric utility is the only authority selling electricity to, and buying excess rooftop PV generation, from customers. This is changing as utilities explore new business models including Distributed System Operator (DSO) models. On the other side of the meter, with the increasing penetration of rooftop solar panels, Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices and smart meters, several new opportunities on the horizon have emerged that allow buildings to participate in a Transactive energy network, involving peer-to-peer (P2P) exchange of excess solar PV generation (kilowatt-hours) and demand reduction capabilities (negawatts or negative watts). One important challenge of P2P energy trading is the lack of a cost-effective platform to securely track and compensate users for generating power from distributed energy resources (DERs).Although there are several blockchain trials in the energy sector, in all projects including the Brooklyn Microgrid, SolarCoin, LINQ, Blockcharge and WePower, a new set of hardware is needed to measure electricity generation by DERs and provide linkage to a corresponding blockchain network. Another missing element is a means to perform demand reduction, taking into account variation in occupant comfort, and simultaneously tracking negawatt exchanges between any two participants. To address the above challenges, BEM Controls will expand the capabilities of its WiseBldg platform to enable prosumers to participate in the emerging market of Peer-to-Peer (P2P) energy trading. WiseBldg is an open architecture platform capable of remote monitoring and control of various IoT devices, with an initial focus on building energy management. Through BEM Controls\u2019 WiseBldg platform, the need to provide new hardware to enable blockchain can be avoided as its platform is hardware agnostic and can directly address PV inverter controllers, battery storage controllers, smart meters and other IoT devices. Hence, by providing an open-architecture blockchain solution, BEM Controls can reduce deployment costs and interconnection times when establishing a new P2P network. As an emerging technology platform, experts have raised concerns regarding the high transaction costs and limited scalability of blockchain- based platform, so the focus of the BEM Controls\u2019 Phase I approach is to design, develop and demonstrate the technical feasibility of the open-architecture blockchain-enabled energy trading platform built on the open-architecture WiseBldg platform. The performance of the proposed platform in terms of its throughput, latency and scalability will be evaluated. The target is to allow the support of at least 10,000 participants with the response time per transaction of less than 1 minute.If the proposed concept is proven to be feasible and scalable in a laboratory environment, BEM Controls will, in Phase II, demonstrate this concept in a real-world pilot project with an electric utility. Phase I work will also focus on developing case studies to demonstrate opportunities for P2P electricity exchange within complex system-level operations, such as performing demand reductions based on different customer preferences, maximizing distribution system load factors, energy savings by adjusting temperature set points, and local voltage control based on large-scale Volt-VAR or Volt-Watt adjustments of smart inverters."

        "abstract": "The mechanisms guiding nanocatalysis are poorly understood and extremely hard to model. Proposed effort attempts to provide a machine learning based platform that would guide the design of nanocatalytic materials for a variety of applications, beginning with the use of case of chloro-organic contaminant remediation. The current approaches either use conventional molecular dynamics coupled with ab initio approaches to uncover reaction kinetics or machine learning platforms that neglect or under-estimate the soft epitaxy between adsorbant and surface. Using reactive descriptors sourced from MD trajectories with validated potentials, the artificial neural networks will have molecular imprint information key to catalytic pathways. This would elucidate reactive sites using descriptors that eschew the more computationally expensive DFT approaches, leading to larger phase exploration and more translatable models. The artificial neural network models would be based on reactivity descriptors that are very specific to the molecular geometry and nanoparticle feature size. Sensitivity analyses would be done to improve the initial training of data sets for a similar set of contaminants. Robustness of the model would be tested by running the models on a dissimilar system. Finally, hypothetical nanomaterials and facets would be proposed to experimental collaborators."

        "abstract": "Hig e and advanced materials are continually demanding higher magnetic fields. Efforts to generate fields in excess of 25 Tesla have been a principal driver of high temperature superconductor research. Although HTS materials were discovered decades ago and have always shown significant potential for high field use, until recently magnets using the technology have remained elusive. Great progress has been made recently in HTS wire performance. Now attention is turned to the technical challenges of making very high field magnets using the wire.In this program Cryomagnetics will use a new superconductor, Bi-2212, in the development of a compact, very high field magnet. Phase I of the program will involve detailed design of the magnet in collaboration with the Applied Superconductivity Center of the U.S. National High Magnetic Field Laboratory, where the just months ago a new record was set in high field all-superconducting magnets. In Phase II a 25 Tesla all-superconducting magnet will be built and tested.Cryomagnetics is a leading supplier of high field superconducting magnets for high energy physics, medical and materials research applications worldwide. The technology developed in this program will be used in research magnet systems, accelerators, medical treatment devices and numerous other applications."

        "abstract": "According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, hydropower provided approximately 6.5% of the total utility-scale generated electricity in 2016 and is the largest source of renewable energy. Hydropower facilities use a variety of equipment that require lubricants and hydraulic fluids, which are typically petroleum-based products. Due to the inherent proximity of hydropower equipment to waterways, there exists a significant risk that spills and\/or leaks of petroleum-based fluids will result in water contamination and environmental damage. We propose to develop an environmentally acceptable hydraulic fluid for use in hydropower equipment. This fluid will be based on our recently-developed fluid blend, which has already been subjected to extensive lifetime testing at a leading hydropower equipment manufacturer and is scheduled to be tested at a hydropower plant owned by a regional utility. We will work closely with equipment manufacturers and end-users to refine the fluid properties and to meet all relevant market requirements. Specifically in Phase I, we will update our database of existing products, review market requirements, and develop a strategy and product roadmap for the commercialization of environmentally acceptable hydraulic fluids. We will also develop a strategy for the large-scale production of our fluids. In parallel, we will develop an environmentally acceptable hydraulic fluid that meets all required biodegradability, biotoxicity, and bioaccumulation properties, while also showing excellent reliability and viscosity properties, and we will start initial testing of the fluid. While the initial focus is on lubricants and hydraulic fluids for hydropower applications, there are significant benefits to extending the project to include environmentally acceptable hydraulic fluid development for use in marine vessels and related loading\/unloading equipment. Broadening the market beyond hydropower applications is expected to significantly reduce contamination of water, fauna, and flora. Next, we will address the general hydraulic equipment market. Current estimates for North America show that hydraulic machinery leaks 100 million gallons per year. Replacing petroleum-based lubricants and hydraulic fluids with environmentally acceptable fluids would considerably reduce environmental damage and ground water contamination."

        "abstract": "Modern quantum information systems employ optical photons for long distance communication, operating at ambient temperature, between microwave cavities, which house microwave photons used in quantum computing and microwave detection. These optical photons, carried by fiber-optic or free-space links, offer a low-cost, uncooled alternative to bulky, expensive microwave coaxial cables, which are lossy, susceptible to electromagnetic interference, and a significant thermal conductor to the outside ambient environment. To convert between these two types of photons and implement these optical interconnects, it becomes necessary to develop a high-performance photodetector for optical to microwave transduction. Applications of these photodetectors include not only in quantum computing and axion detection, but also in other optical-cryogenic interconnect applications. In this program, a high quantum efficiency, high speed photodetector is proposed, based on previous, successful work with uni-traveling carrier photodetectors. Uni-traveling carrier photodetectors eliminate the slow hole from the drift layer, allowing for higher speeds than their p-i-n counterparts. Both the small business and partnering research institution have demonstrated impressively high-power, high-speed devices, and have a history of successful collaboration in previous government-funded programs. These programs will be leveraged to further optimize for photodetectors which operate at speeds above 5 GHz with quantum efficiencies above 95%. In Phase I, photodetectors will be designed, fabricated, and characterized for device quality, quantum efficiency, and bandwidth. Devices will be demonstrated and delivered to the Department of Energy customer. Risk is mitigated in this Phase I effort through a history of design experience in optimizing device performance, several successful fabrication runs with uni-traveling carrier photodiodes in the proposed materials system, and verified, high accuracy testing equipment and experience at both the small business and partnering research institution. A combination high-speed, high quantum efficiency photodiode which transduces optical to microwave frequencies has numerous applications relevant to a broad spectrum of industries and government entities. For one, providing this frequency down-conversion would solve half of the problem of transducing between optical and microwave photons. This technology could be implemented in the search for the axion, or axion-like particles. A high-quality transducer could also provide a gateway for quantum entanglement between microwave photons at long range or helping to form quantum networks for communication between superconducting quantum computers. Applications span even out to quantum communication and cryptography, allowing for more secure communication between entities, with clear advantages with respect to national security. Critical commercial applications span any fields which necessitate optical-cryogenic interconnects, including radio and infrared astronomy."

        "abstract": "For economically viable large-scale production of microalgae based food and biofuel to become a reality, significant improvements in algal productivity need to be achieved. With current regulatory guidelines, large scale outdoor cultivation of microalgae for these products restricts the use of transgenic algal strains, which in the laboratory, have thus far been the primary strategy taken to effectively increase lipid and growth productivity. Traditional breeding methods would enable development of non-GMO improved algal strains. Though highly successful for increasing crop yields in terrestrial plants, breeding strategies to improve overall productivity have been under-studied in microalgae production. This project will build off of the laboratory based methods developed to breed green algae, and will develop new strains within the Chlamydomonas genus that possess improved carbonate salt and pH tolerance \u2013 two key traits required for fast, robust growth outdoors. The genetic and phenotypic diversity within the Chlamydomonas genus combined with the well-developed protocols to induce and control the sexual cycle allow for the opportunity to create elite, high yielding production quality strains, without the use of genetic engineering. In Phase I, several different isolates of Chlamydomonas containing desired phenotypic traits, such has high pH and high salt tolerance, will be bred and tested for improved growth under outdoor growth conditions. Species within the Chlamydomonas genus have long been used to conduct interspecific crossings in order to answer basic scientific questions, but there has been little application of this classic technology toward improving and developing outdoor production strains. Due to the significant work already conducted in Chlamydomonas genetics, this project is low-risk with high reward, and seeks to reframe the research to be focused on optimization for outdoor production. Phase II work will be focused on developing new traits to further boost productivity, such as higher innate lipid content and resistance to predation, and taking these strains outdoors at a large-scale production facility to demonstrate this increased productivity. This methodology, which uses traditional breeding to develop robust production strains, will ultimately boost aerial productivity in outdoor algal systems, further increasing the feasibility of this industry to provide commercial scale alternative food and fuel sources to the United States."

This project aims to increase biomass feedstock yields by the phototrophic green alga Scenedesmus obliquus by using classical breeding approaches combined with advanced genomics technologies. S. obliquus is an oleaginous alga that can be robustly cultivated in open raceway-type ponds and accumulates valuable carotenoid compounds that can feed directly into established commercial markets. Strain improvement technologies based on inter- and intra-specific whole-genome hybridization will achieve major improvements in biomass yield and carotenoid productivity, anticipated from the synergistic effects of crossing diverse germ plasm cell lines using the sexual recombination approaches available with this alga. Systems biology and genomics approaches will fast-track genetic improvements that enhance biomass yield traits for biofuels and carotenoids production. This phase I effort will demonstrate approaches for inducing mating with sexual recombination for S. obliquus. The team will produce high-resolution marker databases for the haploid strain UTEX 393 and the hybrid diploid strain DOE0152Z. Both algal strains will be cultivated in photobioreactors for baseline data generation and comparison."

        "abstract": "Nuclear fusion has great potential for supplying global energy needs with a clean, abundant energy source. Advanced superconducting magnets will be used to contain the plasma at the center of the reactor. To operate these magnets, new sensors are needed to monitor the superconductors in real-time to detect the signs that the superconductor may quench (lose superconducting properties), so that corrective action can be taken. Luna and Pennsylvania State University (Penn State) are developing an innovative distributed fiber optic sensor to actively measure the temperature along a superconductor to detect a quench event before it occurs. Luna\u2019s core technology lies in Optical Frequency Domain Reflectometry (OFDR), which uses the Rayleigh backscatter fingerprint within an optical fiber as mechanism to monitor temperature or strain, with no dead zones or gaps. Dr. Justin Schwartz and his group at Penn State have experience using Luna\u2019s sensing technology for quench event detection in short lengths of high temperature superconductors. Luna and Penn State will increase the sensing length and improve the sensor integration to bring this technology out of the laboratory and into operating superconductor magnets. During the Phase I effort, Luna and Penn State will investigate the feasibility of these fiber optic sensors. Luna will develop new optical networks and data processing algorithms to extend the sensing length while maintaining a sufficiently high update rate. Penn State will investigate potential sensor routing methods within the superconductor for effective temperature measurement and fabricate a prototype. Luna and Penn State will experimentally validate the technology through a demonstration of its ability to sense the temperature changes associated with a quench event."

        "abstract": "Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) represent a growing segment of the U.S. passenger vehicle market. An increasing number of PHEV models are available to consumers. PHEVs are similar to parallel hybrid vehicles like the Toyota Prius in that they have an electric motor and internal combustion engine that are used synergistically to significantly reduce fuel consumption while maintaining a near constant battery state of charge (i.e. charge sustaining). However, they are different from parallel hybrid vehicles in that they allow external charging when the vehicle is stationary to enable electric-only operation. Electric-only operation (EOO) allows PHEVs to achieve significantly higher fuel economy on a mile per gallon of gasoline equivalent (MPGe) basis over conventional powertrain vehicles. One limitation for consumers choosing to purchase PHEVs is the uncertainty associated with EOO as it strongly depends on route, driving style and ambient temperature. The primary goal of this project is to extend EOO range, and therefore improve fuel economy by using a connected vehicle powertrain and routing co-optimization (VPRO) strategy as an aftermarket solution for PHEV owners. The proposed project combines the Macchina team\u2019s expertise in vehicle closed area network (CAN) interpretation and vehicle communication device (VCD) hardware development with the University of Minnesota\u2019s (UMN) research expertise in vehicle powertrain and routing co- optimization (VPRO) technology. VPRO technology uses historical data and exogenous data like weather and traffic and machine learning algorithms in concert with low-order physics-based models to determine when a PHEV should be in EOO mode for a given pre-programmed route. The primary technical objectives of this Phase I project are to: 1) Design a prototype vehicle communication device (VCD) based our previously developed M2 automotive interface to collect necessary vehicle data and enable EV mode in a chosen PHEV remotely; 2) Determine the technical feasibility and robustness of the hardware; and 3) Quantify potential vehicle fuel economy improvements through computer simulation of a chosen PHEV using real-world vehicle data recorded using the VCD to improve accuracy."

        "abstract": "As fossil fuels continue to serve as a major energy source, CO2 capture for utilization or sequestration is the only option to mitigate the CO2 emissions to the environment. However, the separation of CO2 from flue gas is an extremely costly proposition with existing technologies. Advanced membrane technology may address this challenge, if new membranes with CO2 permeance of 4,500 gpu and CO2\/N2 selectivity of 40 can be developed. We propose to develop novel, scalable membranes based on microphase-separated block copolymers of metal-organic frameworks (BCP-MOFs) and rubbery poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) to achieve superior CO2\/N2 separation properties. The continuous phase is based on state-of-the-art amorphous PEO and the discontinuous phase of MOFs has permanent pores and extremely high gas permeability. If successfully developed, these game-changing membranes would outperform currently leading membranes by 100% - 300% in CO2 permeance, which will enable the membrane processes to meet the 2035 DOE target of 4500 GPU and CO2\/N2 selectivity &gt;40 will be demonstrated. Models and process cycles suitable for these membranes will be developed and preliminary economics projected"

        "abstract": "Dry storage of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) is canisters can be threatened by corrosion of the metallic canisters which incur substantial repair and replacement costs and logistical issues. A novel cold spray repair and mitigation approach is proposed to repair corroded SNF canisters and mitigate the corrosion threat for fabricated canisters. The proposed work utilizes a novel cold spray technique whereby a low temperature repair can take place which does not degrade the component chemistry or microstructure. In addition, no sparks are present which could cause reactions with evolved hydrogen gasses and the process can be performed remotely using robotic deposition. Lastly, complex geometries can be repaired, and the technique can also be utilized as a mitigation strategy prior to placing the canisters in the field. Phase I will see the repair of a base stainless steel alloy via cold spray of two advanced corrosion resistant alloys as well as the base stainless steel alloy. The repaired coupons will then be compared to an un-repaired coupon in terms of stress corrosion cracking, general corrosion, and mechanical property performance. Furthermore, the development of a mobile robotic repair strategy which can be performed in-situ at storage facilities will be evaluated. Successful demonstration of the cold spray repair technique for spent nuclear fuel canisters would provide a significant enhancement for the logistics of SNF storage methods where new canisters costs several million dollars. Furthermore, a valid and qualified repair technique would enable higher adoption rates of the dry cask method and provide a trusted storage method for the 50,000 metric tons of SNF in the United States. Demonstration of cold spray repair for high risk applications such as SNF storage can enable further exploration in other critical repair areas of nuclear reactors, aerospace applications, and automotive applications. If a mobile repair strategy is deemed realistic, this could further assist in the adoption of the proposed technology."

        "abstract": "The discovery of large shale gas reserves in recent years has resulted in the reduction of natural gas price and a need to develop new applications for the available resource. Upgrading shale gas to liquid fuels which are more easily transportable and have greater economic value can result in significant benefits to the US. Coupled with this challenging problem the DOE has a goal of further developing new low temperature plasma technologies with improved energy efficiency. This project will develop a technology area that is of great interest to DOE due to it\u2019s potential for energy savings while at the same time solving one of the most pressing problems in the US energy resource portfolio. HiFunda will partner with researchers at Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL) to develop a low- temperature, plasma-based method of upgrading shale gas to liquid fuels. This development effort will couple low-temperature plasma and novel catalyst materials to improve the selectivity and energy efficiency of methane conversion to higher-value synthetic liquids. Conventional methods for methane partial oxidation to methanol typically require high reaction temperatures (400\u20131000\u00b0C) and pressures (&gt;10 atm), which limits commercial viability. Low-temperature, nonequilibrium plasma technology overcomes the disadvantage of high temperatures and pressures because the majority of the electrical energy goes into the production of energetic electrons which can break the C\u2013H bonds of methane. Typically, plasma processes are usually less selective with more complex product distributions than catalytic processes, however this issue will be overcome by coupling the plasma with heterogeneous catalysts to improve the selectivity of the desired products. Over 40 billion cubic tons per day of shale gas is produced in the US each day, and the US has approximately 610 Terra cubic feet of shale natural gas resources. Despite its abundance, less than 1% of the natural gas is being used as vehicle fuel in the US. About 15% of this gas is flared due to the lack of infrastructure to bring this gas to market. Flaring in North Dakota alone produced about 4.5 million metric tons of CO2 in 2012, roughly the equivalent of adding 1 million new cars to U.S. highways. Clearly, developing technology that turns this wasted resource into value-added products will have huge benefits by reduction of dependence on foreign oil, creation of local energy jobs, and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from flaring."

        "abstract": "Graphene nanomaterials offers multiple technical benefits in printed electronics, structural materials, displays, capacitors, high-performance computing applications, and especially energy storage where researchers have reported a five-fold increase in the charge rate of a graphene- enhanced Li-ion battery. Historically, industrial production of graphene nanomaterials has been hindered by the need to use substrates or catalysts involving costly or impractical separation methods, which prevent the economical scaling of production. Conventional methods have low yields, limited throughputs, and\/or high-energy requirements, which limit production rates (0.2 mg\/min) and translate into extraordinarily high costs ($450-$4,500 per kg). An opportunity exists to utilize low-temperature microwave plasma for the substrate-free production of graphene platelets using process conditions known to promote single-atom thick carbon formations. This opportunity will be addressed by using an innovative low-temperature microwave plasma process operating at atmospheric pressure without laboratory-style plasma dielectric containment or substrates to produce graphene nanoplatelets with virtually zero process CO2 emissions, lower energy requirements, lower operating costs, and lower capital costs than the existing state of the art. Phase I seeks to determine the temperature range wherein conversion towards desired graphene nanomaterial is unrestricted by energetic barriers. Consistent with predictive model development, simulations will be performed to determine the temperature-time profile of the reacting flow, and these profiles will be compared to graphene nanomaterial yield and quality for optimization of process conditions. The project will deliver an innovative low-temperature microwave plasma process for converting natural gas into graphene nanomaterials, overcoming the technical and economic limitations of conventional methods. Presently, the extraordinarily high cost of conventional methods of producing of graphene nanomaterial is the single greatest factor preventing numerous commercial sectors from enjoying the benefits of these otherwise highly desired and versatile materials. By avoiding the labor and capital intensive steps of conventional production, an innovative low-temperature microwave plasma process can be scaled to production rates unachievable by conventional methods and can be deployed with less capital and at significantly lower operating costs. With a two order of magnitude reduction in production cost promised by low-temperature microwave plasma, graphene nanomaterial use will be rendered economical in multiple industries where the use of graphene has hitherto been cost-prohibitive."

        "abstract": "Fusion plasma devices at various DOE and international facilities need high-speed diagnostic tools to understand, predict, and control fusion plasmas. Thomson scattering (TS) at tens of Hz has routinely measured electron temperature (Te) and electron number density (ne) inside the plasma system. However, at these data rates traditional TS can obtain only a sparse data set, which significantly limits in catching the plasma dynamics. Improved diagnostics with high temporal resolution are highly desired, as outlined at the 2015 Fusion Energy Science Workshop on Plasma Material Interactions and Workshop on Transients. Spectral Energies proposes to develop and commercialize hundreds-of-kHz-rate microwave and tens-of-kHz-rate Thomson scattering instruments based on diode and flashlamp-pumped burst-mode laser systems. Burst-mode lasers could be designed and operate in high-speed (up to MHz rates) or high-power (up to 2 Joule\/pulse). Two key commercial products will be developed: 1) High-speed microwave scattering system for key atomic species (H &amp; D) and electron number density and 2) High-speed Thomson scattering system for electron number density and electron temperature. The new improved diagnostics high-repetition-rates will enable unprecedented diagnostic capabilities and understanding for plasma instabilities, plasma wall interactions, and edge plasma characterizations and control. In Phase I, major research efforts will focus on demonstration of in-situ quantitative microwave and Thomson scattering from thermal plasma systems by optimizing the laser for pulse energy along with duration, shape, spacing, and wavelength to suppress the background scattering and stray light. The proposed techniques will be applied (possibly in Phase II) in the Prototype Material Plasma Exposure eXperiment (Proto-MPEX) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) or possibly at the Lithium Tokamak eXperiement Beta (LTX-Beta) device at Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL)"

        "abstract": "The power output of the high power lasers used in physics research is limited by the materials available for making the gain media in the laser. Future increases in power will require new and better materials. Operation at high power creates great thermal stresses that can lead to effects such as birefringence, thermal lensing or even physical fracture damage to the host itself. Effective cooling and small temperature gradients are critical for achieving higher powers. Using disk lasers can mitigate these issues, but the achievable power is still limited by the material. The innovation in this proposed effort is to produce ceramic YAG disks with a radial gradient of dopant concentration. This will improve the beam quality by \u201cmatching\u201d the laser and pump profiles; optimize the efficiency by minimizing the pumped area that is not extracted, and minimize the ASE losses (amplified spontaneous emission) by limiting the (unextracted) lateral gain (i.e. perpendicular to the lasing axis). The graded disk will be fabricated using a revolutionary new ceramics processing technology, the Direct Ink Write process. This will make possible the construction of a higher power, side-pumped, back-cooled solid state disk laser for accelerator applications. In Phase I, RMD, in collaboration with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), will determine the feasibility of producing ceramic components with a graded dopant concentration profile that can replace the present crystalline, or even ceramic materials, now used in high power lasers. The issues addressed will include optimizing ceramic composition and dopant concentration profile by direct ink write deposition, to produce a design that minimizes temperature gradients, and thus reduces thermally induced birefringence and depolarization. By the end of Phase I we expect to have prepared and characterized sample disks containing a radial gradient in dopant content. In Phase II, RMD and LLNL will optimize the production process and build a laboratory prototype laser system. Lasers are now used in every aspect of life. High-power lasers are used for research, laser ranging, and for environmental sciences. Defense agencies also use high-power lasers for missile guiding and ranging. Industrial applications include cutting and welding. In healthcare services, high power lasers are used in areas such as eye surgery and cosmetic surgery. Laser seeded coherent X-ray sources can be used for very high resolution imaging of fundamental events in biology and physics. The ability to produce higher power will enhance research, improve security, and increase the productivity of manufacturing processes that use high power lasers."

        "abstract": "The design and realization of thermal\/environmental barrier coatings systems for the protection and insulation of ceramic matrix composites that can withstand combustion temperatures approaching 3100 Fahrenheit is a formidable challenge. But that is necessary for achieving 65% efficiency target in future combined-cycle gas-turbine engines. A multifaceted research program is proposed to address this challenge squarely. At the core of the proposed program is an innovative three-pronged approach that builds on our vast collective\/collaborative experience in this area. Approach 1 entails multilayer, multifunctional plasma-sprayed coating system comprising different embodiments of thermal barrier coatings, environmental barrier coatings, and bond-coat. The materials and microstructures in each of these layers are rationally designed and selected to meet the afore-stated requirements. In Approach 2, dense plasma-sprayed coatings of newly designed ceramics with unprecedentedly low thermal conductivity will be used to combine both thermal-barrier and environmental-barrier functions in a single material for the first time. The hybrid Approach 3 combines Approaches 1 and 2 into one, where the thermal-barrier layer and the new low-thermal conductivity environmental-barrier layer are combined for synergistic benefits. Some redundancies and well thought out risk-mitigation strategies are built-in in the proposed program to ensure its success. The materials design will be guided by model experiments on sintered ceramic pellets, and the design of the multilayer, multifunctional architecture design will be informed by a thermo-mechanical modeling effort that can anticipate failures and their locations under aggressive thermal loading (thermal gradient) and excursions that are expected in these systems, enabling optimal design strategies. The deposition of multi-layer coatings of different materials will be guided by in situ diagnostics and process- modeling protocol pioneered by our team. The suite of process parameters that emerge from this effort will be used to achieve programmed plasma-sprayed coatings with target compositions, phases, microstructures, and other characteristics. The resulting coatings will be characterized, and their performance will be evaluated, results from which will be fed back into the models iteratively to create a fine-tuned coatings solution for future commercialization. In Phase I of the proposed program, the initial feasibility of the three-pronged approach will be demonstrated, working closely with key partners including government, an engine manufacturer, and a coatings company. The Phase I effort will establish a framework for full scale development in Phase II and beyond."

        "abstract": "Increased productivity of wind turbines and wind plants requires a better understanding of the unsteady blade aerodynamics.This understanding could lead to improved energy capture and reduced blade loading and to a better understanding of wake development and propagation that promises to increase the overall production of a wind plant. Unsteady pressure measurements on the surface of the blades of an industrial-scale wind turbine operating in the field would greatly aid in this process. Due to the harsh environments in which wind turbines operate as well as the difficulties inherent in servicing and accessing the blades, a limited number of pressure measurements on full scale turbines have been conducted. Whereas the prior efforts developed pressure measurement systems as part of a larger campaign, this effort specifically focuses on the challenges of unsteady pressure measurements on a wind turbine blade. It is anticipated that a measurement system specifically tailored to the field environment that addresses its inherent challenges can be designed and manufactured thus allowing easier implementation. In the work proposed here, we aim to design and manufacture a pressure measurement system capable of being installed on a wind turbine. In Phase I, a system will be demonstrated in the laboratory that will allow unsteady pressure measurements and will provide the ancillary systems that increase measurement accuracy for extended time periods. There will be a focus on a robust, self-contained system that is capable of long-term operations on a wind turbine blade in a field environment. A user-friendly graphical interface, communication systems, and software for post-processing the raw pressure measurement data will also be developed. Phase 2 would focus on deploying this system on an operational wind turbine to demonstrate its capabilities and to identify any issues that remain to be addressed. Development of a robust pressure measurement system that can be successfully operated in the harsh wind turbine environment would translate to other environmentally and operationally difficult applications. In particular, applications such as environmental wind tunnel testing, helicopter research, flight testing and gas turbine research could utilize such a system to advance the quality of experimental measurements in their respective fields. In addition, improvement in the models used to design wind turbines and wind plants would be possible using the data generated by the proposed system to validate the models thereby leading to improved predictive capability."

        "abstract": "Currently, indium tin oxide (ITO) is used as the transparent conductive anode in all commercial organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs). However, ITO has economic and technological limitations for OLEDs such as high cost, brittleness, and poor performance. The primary objective of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I proposal is to demonstrate the microfluidic printing of substrate embedded metal microgrids with transmission over 90% in the visible range and sheet resistance less than 1 \u2126\/square over a 10 x 10 cm area with all processing at low temperatures (&lt; 120\u25e6 C). The approach will be to develop a microfluidic printing technology, which utilizes selective hydrophobic and hydrophilic areas in the substrate, to pattern the metal ink into high performance, flexible transparent electrodes. The technical tasks of Phase I are to (1) develop high performance metal inks and stretchable metal inks, (2) develop microfluidic printing methods that pattern metal inks directly into rigid glass and flexible plastic substrates,(3) perform simulations to design metal microgrids for high performance, and (4) characterize manufactured samples optically and electronically and characterize performance under repeated bending and stretching. The results of this work will target the commercial application of OLEDs. This technology may lower the costs and improve the efficiencies of OLEDs used in displays, wearables, and lighting. The transparent electrode technology may also be applicable to RF-ID tags, artificial skin, and the Internet of Things. This proposed substrate embedded microgrids are a new disruptive technology that has the potential to exceed the performance of ITO, the standard for commercial transparent conductors. The main innovation of the proposed technology is that grids with small widths (&lt; 10 \u00b5m) and large thicknesses (&gt; 10 \u00b5m) can all be printed at low temperatures with high throughput embedded into substrates that allow for subsequent organic layer deposition. The PIs will collaborate with OLEDWorks in Phase II on integrating, testing, and characterizing the microgrids with state-of-the-art OLEDs."

        "abstract": "Local Motors (https:\/\/localmotors.com\/) is an automotive OEM that is currently developing a connected and automated vehicle for various shuttle bus applications. The OlliTM vehicle is intended to be an electric vehicle driven by four in-wheel electric motors that allow for independent actuation and control for increased traction stability and operation efficiency. This electric vehicle shuttle design is novel and presents a promising architecture because of the flexibility in vehicle control, especially as a connected and automated vehicle. With the actuation redundancy and information from environment sensors, other vehicles, and infrastructure, the Olli vehicle is anticipated to increase the operation efficiency up to 20% for the same local driving scenario, compared with to human-drive mode with a centralized powertrain architecture. The objective of this project will be to use the redundant control degrees of freedom enabled by the independent, in-wheel motors and the information obtained from the vehicle connectivity, specifically Vehicle-To-Everything information such as Signal Phase and Timing information from the traffic signals, and Vehicle-To-Vehicle information from surrounding vehicles to optimize the control algorithm for maximum energy efficiency. The Vehicle-To-Vehicle connectivity will include road topography information used in a calculation of upcoming vehicle pitch and roll angles. The maximum vehicle operation efficiency will be achieved by simultaneously realizing the high-level vehicle (speed, acceleration and deceleration, and path selection) efficiency optimization and the component-level motor (torque allocation and distribution) efficiency optimization. The Research Institution partner, Arizona State University, is already developing the connected and automated, electric vehicle that will serve as the testbed for Olli automated driving control strategies. In Phase I of the project, Local Motors and Arizona State University will formulate and develop the joint high- level and low-level optimization problem to be used in for the control algorithm with a goal of maximizing vehicle efficiency. After testing at Local Motors and Arizona State University, the vehicle\u2019s operation will be tested in Anthem, Arizona, a residential area within the Maricopa County Department of Transportation purview \u2013 in collaboration with the Maricopa County Department of Transportation. Maricopa County Department of Transportation has equipped several intersections of the Anthem testbed with connectivity equipment that provide Signal Phase and Timing information and has vehicles that can provide the upcoming topography information. The combination of testbed and test area will allow for rapid control strategy development. The intent will be to employ a developed control algorithm in the Olli vehicle by the end of Phase 1 that shows 10% improvement in energy efficiency from the baseline vehicle. If applications for Phase II and III are awarded, the energy efficiency increase achieved through optimization of the vehicle control strategy will allow for a longer range and\/or smaller energy storage system that will improve the performance and commercial prospects of the developing Olli shuttle bus. More electric shuttle buses can reduce city congestion and local pollution by providing an alternative to vehicles and can increase mobility for older and disabled citizens. High-occupancy vehicles reduce energy consumption, especially for highly efficient electric vehicles. Finally, a connected and automated electric shuttle will significantly reduce traffic accidents that lead to many injuries and deaths."

        "abstract": "Recently, the Generation IV International Forum has established a set of nuclear reactors (advanced nuclear reactors), with main objectives to improve overall reactor safety, efficiency, sustainability, and proliferation resistance for economically viable nuclear energy. These advanced reactor technologies rely on novel fuels and materials that are resistant to radiation damage and corrosive environments, while withstanding significantly higher operating temperatures. However, the lack of data for most of these novel and advanced materials calls for renewed testing efforts performed in an intense fast neutron flux (E &gt;0.1 MeV) while mimicking a fast reactor-like environment. Fast fluxes greater than 1015 n\/cm2s provide an accelerated material radiation-damage rates of ~20 dpa\/yr. These fluxes are conventionally achieved with fast reactors, which are not currently available in the US, since the shutdown of the Fast Flux Test Facility. Therefore, US researchers are required to ship samples overseas for long-term irradiations or utilize domestic thermal-spectrum test reactors; both of which have their own set of complications and drawbacks. To overcome this problem, Niowave proposed to develop a subcritical testbed that can provide a fast reactor-like environment to support experimentation and demonstration of novel fuels and materials, without the logistical and regulatory challenges and expenses of fast reactors. In this system, an electron linac with a lead-bismuth eutectic neutron converter is coupled to a HYbrid fast\/thermal core configuration Subcritical Testbed (called HYST) to provide 1015 n\/cm2s fast flux level. The fast core region contains a sufficient volume (\u2265100 cm3) for testing advanced nuclear reactor materials. In Phase I, two candidate core designs were devised by modeling and examining the neutronics performance characteristics of the fast\/thermal core and evaluating the linac-based external neutron source. Both core designs, HYST \u2013 I and \u2013 II, showed the feasibility of the hybrid core configuration concept and a noticeable reduction in the fission power and fissile loading compared to an all fast core design. In Phase II, Niowave proposes to license, construct, and operate a small-scale low-power demonstration system with Niowave\u2019s existing uranium fuel, based on HYST-I concept, and perform detailed core design and tradeoff studies of the targeted goal for HYST while establishing the NRC licensing roadmap. In Phase III, a prototype of HYST design will be licensed, built, and operated at ~200 kW fission power (1\/100th of final design level), producing 1013 n\/cm2s fast neutron flux level by 2025 with a budget "

        "abstract": "Under the Department of Energy\u2019s Ground-based Nuclear Detonation Research and Development (GNDD R&amp;D) Program, the Air Force Technical Application\u2019s Center (AFTAC) monitors for nuclear explosions through high altitude whole-air gas sampling using compressors to inject air into a high-flow air stream or store in a high-pressure vessel. The existing compressors have proven reliability issues with exhaustive maintenance requirements. A highly reliable compressor with near zero maintenance that can be manufactured readily and operate at high pressure will serve a critical pain point in the AFTAC\u2019s mission to monitor for nuclear explosions banned by several international treaties and moratoria. Under a Phase II STTR, Koo and Associates International (KAI), The University of Texas at Austin Center for Electromechanics (UT-CEM), and Gas Technology Institute (GTI) propose to build and demonstrate a high reliability linear motor compressor. \nThe Phase I linear motor compressor was designed with commercialization in mind and reducing time to market to enable a timely solution for the GNDD R&amp;D Program. In addition other compressor applications in this design space have been identified which provides the business case for starting a company to produce the compressor. The linear motor compressor uses off-the-shelf linear motors to directly drive a four-stage compressor tied to one end of the motor assembly. This approach uniquely combines the functions of the compressor and motor into one device with a single moving part, thus eliminating the traditional crankshaft. The design results in fewer parts and wearing components with reduced parasitic friction and increased durability and reliability without the need for oil lubricants. The design also promises to ease manufacturing and reduce initial investment, as well as maintenance needs and cost. In Phase II, the project team will build and demonstrate the linear motor compressor and show that the system satisfies the performance requirements of the Ground-based Nuclear Detonation Research and Development (GNDD R&amp;D) Program."

        "abstract": "&quot;The next generation of very high field accelerator magnets (20 T or more) are expected to be made with high-temperature superconductors (HTS) along with conventional low-temperature superconductors (LTS) to reduce cost. The operation and protection of these magnets becomes very challenging particularly if the HTS coils are made with the tapes and operate at a much lower current than the LTS coils. Accelerator magnets must also satisfy the stringent field quality requirements, which is a significant challenge for magnets made with HTS tapes. We propose to develop very high field hybrid accelerator magnet technology using HTS coils made with high current CORC\u00ae cables operating in series with the LTS coils made with Rutherford cables. The coils made with the partially transposed CORC\u00ae cables offer higher current operation and better field quality than the coils made with HTS tapes. The CORC\u00ae cables have matured into a high performance magnet cable. The common coil design, a conductor-friendly design with large bend radii, enables a rapid transition of high current density CORC\u00ae cables into 2-in-1 collider dipoles. During Phase I of the program, we\u2019ve increased the current density in CORC\u00ae cables to 400 A\/mm2 at 4.2 K and 20 T. Initial hybrid Common Coil magnets have been designed, showing that the current CORC\u00ae cable performance is more than sufficient to reach a total field of 16 T with an existing 10 T LTS outsert. During Phase II, we will design, manufacture, and test a fullsize hybrid Common Coil magnet with a CORC\u00ae insert coil that would generate at least 14 T. Conceptual designs for a 20 T hybrid magnet will also be developed, taking all factors important for accelerator magnets into account, such as field quality and quench protection. \n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits\nHigh field magnets wound from high-temperature superconducting magnet cables will enable some of the next generation of high-energy physics magnets, proton cancer treatment facilities, practical fusion magnets, and scientific magnets. These magnets will also benefit superconducting magnetic energy storage systems for use in the power grid and for application within the Department of Defense.\n&quot;\n"
